Predict Customer Churn (the right way) using PyCaret Customer retention is one of the primary KPI for companies with a subscription-based business model. Competition is tough particularly in the SaaS market where customers are free to choose from plenty of providers. Easy MLOps with PyCaret + MLflow PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library and end-to-end model management tool built-in Python for automating machine learning workflows. It is known for its ease of use, simplicity, and ability to quickly and efficiently build and deploy end-to-end ML prototypes. Time Series Forecasting with PyCaret Regression Module PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library and end-to-end model management tool built-in Python for automating machine learning workflows.

It allows you to do prototyping quickly and efficiently from your choice of notebook environment. How to use PyCaret — the library for low-code ML When we approach supervised machine learning problems, it can be tempting to just see how a random forest or gradient boosting model performs and stop experimenting if we are satisfied with the results. PyCaret 2.1 is here: What’s new? We are excited to announce PyCaret 2.1 — update for the month of Aug 2020.
