(2) What’s the Dying ReLU problem? (3) What causes the Dying ReLU problem? (4) How to solve the Secret Sauce behind the beauty of Deep Learning: Beginners guide to Activation Functions Activation functions are functions which take an input signal and convert it to an output signal. Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the networks that is why we call them non-linearities. Understanding Activation Functions in Neural Networks Recently, a colleague of mine asked me a few questions like “why do we have so many activation functions?”, “why is that one works better than the other?”, ”how do we know which one to use?”, “is it hardcore maths?” and so on. Activation Functions Get the latest machine learning methods with code. Browse our catalogue of tasks and access state-of-the-art solutions. 5 Must-Know Activation Functions Used in Neural Networks The universal approximation theorem implies that a neural network can approximate any continuous function that maps inputs (X) to outputs (y). The ability to represent any function is what makes the neural networks so powerful and widely-used.
