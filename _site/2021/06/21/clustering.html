<meta name="description" content="Clustering links Introduction to hierarchical clustering (Part 3 In our attempt to cluster crimes in London in the previous article, we ignored the spatial dimension of the data in performing the clustering. Thus, this article seeks to remedy this by explicitly accounting for this. Handling Outliers in Clusters using Silhouette Analysis The real-world data often has a lot of outlier values. The cause of outliers can be data corruption or failure to record data. The handling of outliers is very important during the data preprocessing pipeline as the presence of outliers can prevent the model to perform best. Silhouette Method — Better than Elbow Method to find Optimal Clusters Hyperparameters are model configurations properties that define the model and remain constants during the training of the model. The design of the model can be changed by tuning the hyperparameters. How to cluster images based on visual similarity In this tutorial, I&#39;m going to walk you through using a pre-trained neural network to extract a feature vector from images and cluster the images based on how similar the feature vectors are.
