Why People Share: The Psychology Behind “Going Viral” From 2000-2006 I ran the world’s largest psychological testing website — Tickle.com. We had 5 psychology and statistics PhDs on staff at the company, and our goal was to develop a system for understanding human motivations in order to get products to go viral. The Tribal Network Effect (nfx #15) In 2017 we published the NFX Manual which laid out 13 types of network effects.
