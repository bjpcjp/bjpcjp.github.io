Many tasks come configured with Rails out of the box to provide important functionality. 16 interesting and useful GitHub Rails repositories from November 5 Originally I shared this digest to Syndicode blog. More than a month passed since I made the previous Rails digest issue. Well, but there is no particular need to create it more often, because even the most accurate selection needs time to separate the wheat from the chaff. Understanding Polymorphic Associations in Rails Polymorphic associations can be tricky to understand and many times one can get confused about when to use them, how to use them and how they are different from other associations. In this article we will go over these issues. Top 10 errors from 1000+ Ruby on Rails projects (and how to avoid them) To give back to our community of developers, we looked at our database of thousands of projects and found the top 10 errors in Ruby on Rails projects. We’re going to show you what causes them and how to prevent them from happening. If you avoid these &quot;gotchas,&quot; it&#39;ll make you a better developer. amerine/acts_as_tree ActsAsTree extends ActiveRecord to add simple support for organizing items into parent–children relationships.

But everybody builds a chat. So next, I thought about a realtime dashboard. Rails Composer An application template that creates starter applications for Rails. It’s the Rails generator on steroids. My journey from Rspec feature tests to Rails system tests Quite often I find myself spending hours debugging(and sometimes finally deleting) a flaky feature test. Finally I decided to stop doing that, and after watching the Rails Conf talk about system testing, decided it was time to act. Single file Rails applications (for fun and bug reporting) As you might know from previous posts, I keep a Rails playground project around. That’s a small application with a bunch of models, controllers and accompanying tests. Speeding Up Rendering Rails Pages with render_async Adding new code to Rails controllers can bring a couple of problems with it.
