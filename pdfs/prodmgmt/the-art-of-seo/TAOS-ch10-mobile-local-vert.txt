CHAPTER TEN

Mobile, Local, and Vertical SEO
Mobile, local, and vertical SEO have grown to become specializations in and of themselves, requiring a tremendous amount of dedicated effort, resources, and attention to
fully maximize the opportunities they provide as the web ecosystem evolves. In this
chapter, we will address these areas of search engine optimization at a high level.

The Mobile Landscape
If you have a web-based business, brand, or organization, mobile SEO will be absolutely vital to the success of your overall SEO strategy. But before we can examine the
ins and outs of SEO for mobile, you need to first understand mobile search in the general context of mobile as a medium—one that is taking search market share and ad
spend from desktop at a rapid pace.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, eMarketer published a study predicting that mobile ad
spend would represent 72.2% of total U.S. digital ad spend by 2019 (Figure 10-1).

The iPhone helped drive the growth of this market, because of its intuitive user interface and larger screen size (when compared to feature phones), and Android accelerated this trend with its increasing smartphone market dominance.1.
The improved mobile web user interfaces and larger screen sizes on smartphones have
been a big factor in the growth of mobile search. Having a specific mobile site experience for users is important, as mobile searchers are even more impatient and have a
different intent than your typical desktop searcher. If you offer a desktop experience to
a mobile user and she finds a competitor who offers a tailored mobile experience, you
may have just lost a potential customer—and the search engines know this.
Rapid growth in mobile is expected to continue. On June 13, 2014, Matt Cutts told the
audience at SMX Advanced in Seattle that before the end of 2014 Google would
receive more search queries per day from mobile devices than it would from desktop
devices. Google’s mobile-friendly algorithm shift followed less than a year later. Today,
a Google search from any mobile device shows us that the mobile landscape has
evolved into an entirely unique, mobile-first search environment.

SEO for Mobile
The mobile tipping point in organic search has been reached. In April 2015, Google
rolled out its mobile-friendly algorithm. Using a definitive, “yes or no” response ranking factor, this algorithm determines whether a site (or a specific page from a site) is
mobile friendly, and then incorporates this information into its ranking decision for a

mobile query. (Note that as of this writing, the mobile-friendly algorithm was not
being applied to Google News content for mobile queries returning News results, or for
Google News–specific searches).
Google’s message with this algorithm update, which it warned would have more of an
impact on its search results than either Panda or Penguin (learn more about Panda and
Penguin in Chapter 9), was clear: if you want your site’s content to show for mobile
queries, you need to build your site for the mobile user experience. At the most basic
level, this means that your mobile site must be:

Fast
Pages should ideally load in less than 1 second.

Functional
Page content should display and function properly in mobile browsers (no CSS,
JavaScript, image, or other resource blocking).

Finger-friendly
Tap targets (e.g., buttons, links, form fields) should be large enough and properly
spaced for small touchscreen use.

Free from redirects and errors
Mobile version URL requests should all return 200 (OK) status codes—no 301/302
redirects or errors, if possible.
There are various ways to implement a mobile version of your site that delivers userfriendly functionality to a mobile browser, with three being accepted by Google. Note
that these fall into two general categories for SEO purposes—same URLs, and separate
URLs:

Responsive web design, or RWD (same URLs)
Your site utilizes the same URLs for desktop and mobile. Your site’s server always
sends the same HTML to all devices, and cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to
alter the rendering of the page on the device. Google can generally detect RWD as
long as the site’s assets (including CSS) are crawlable.

Dynamic serving, a.k.a. adaptive design (same URLs)
Your site utilizes the same URLs for desktop and mobile, but your site’s server
responds with different HTML and CSS depending on the user agent requesting
the page.

Separate URLs
Your site utilizes different URLs for the desktop and mobile (and perhaps even
tablet) versions of your site’s content (utilizing a subdomain such as m.site.com, for
example), with device-optimized content served at each URL version.

THE MOBILE LANDSCAPE

Same URL approaches: responsive web design and dynamic serving
As you can see, the first two options (responsive web design and dynamic serving)
retain the same URLs across devices, while the third option (separate URLs) creates
two entirely separate websites for the search engines to crawl, index, and rank. This is
a major factor to consider before developing your mobile site.
A significant advantage offered by using the same URLs is that the mobile site may
more effectively inherit the SEO characteristics of the desktop site. In other words, the
link profile and social signals are automatically associated with the mobile version of
the site (which is not the case with a mobile subdomain). These “same URL”
approaches are considered by some to be the best option if you intend to support
smartphone-type devices only, and do not plan to support feature phones (e.g., traditional flip phones).
The most cost-effective of these two approaches is usually RWD, as only one site “version” is being created and maintained. For this reason, RWD has seen rapid adoption
in the mobile space.
In contrast to RWD, dynamic serving—whereby entirely different site versions are
designed and coded with device-specific optimization and user experience in mind—
renders different HTML for the same URL request, based on the user agent making the
request. While this approach is more budget, development, and maintenance intensive, it often can allow for faster load times, and a more optimized user experience
specifically tailored to device type.

Separate URL approach
You may wish to offer a mobile-specific URL for marketing and promotion purposes,
or to allow access to the mobile version of your site regardless of the user agent making the request. In particular, if you plan to support both smartphones and feature
phones, having a mobile subdomain allows you some additional flexibility in dealing
with different screen sizes, or if your site is so large that you can’t provide a separate
mobile experience for each page.
Some well-known examples of such URLs include http://m.facebook.com, http://
mobile.weather.gov, http://www.hotels.com/mobile/, and http://en.m.wikipedia.org. The benefit of serving up a distinct mobile version instead of serving your standard version with
mobile-friendly CSS is that you can trim the file size of the HTML sent to the mobile
device, eliminating code that the device won’t be able to run, which improves page
load time and makes the page look better to mobile bots. Google provides more information about separate URLs for mobile here: http://bit.ly/separate_urls.

638

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

Mobile user agents
Google employs different spiders for the mobile Web: Googlebot-Mobile for feature
phones, and the standard Googlebot with an iPhone user agent for smartphones. Bing,
on the other hand, uses the same crawler for both mobile content and desktop content, called Bingbot), and utilizes crawler variants in the following format:
Mozilla/5.0 + (Mobile Device) + Mobile Engine + Mobile Browser +
bingbot/BingPreview/[version]

Both search engines use user-agent detection to determine if a searcher is on a mobile
browser or a traditional desktop browser, and will show feature phone users a mobile
experience. At the beginning of each browsing session, the user’s hardware and
browser combination will communicate a unique identifier to the website’s web
server, known as the user agent. This string identifies the nature of the hardware and
software making the request.
The best practice for mobile site user experience, and hence for mobile SEO, is to
detect the incoming user agent and show the user the version of your site specific to
the user’s device. If you are using the same URLs for both your desktop and mobile
sites (as in responsive web design and dynamic serving), you simply show users the
alternative version of your content. If you are using separate URLs, you will want to
redirect mobile users to that mobile URL.
A useful tool for server-side user agent detection is MobileDetect.net, which provides
an open source PHP class (Mobile_Detect) for user agent detection and is supported by
third-party plug-ins for WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, Concrete5, and other
content management systems, as listed in “3rd party modules”.

General SEO guidelines for mobile
Some general tips for your SEO mobile strategy include the following:
• Review search engine recommendations for mobile SEO (and check for updates
regularly!):
— Google’s Mobile SEO page from its Webmaster’s Mobile Guide
— Bing’s “Meet Our Mobile Bots” page
NOTE
Bing generally does not provide as much webmaster/SEO support as
Google.

• Ensure critical site files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are accessible to the search
engines; many of these files signal to the search engines that the page is built to

THE MOBILE LANDSCAPE

www.it-ebooks.info

639

display and work well on a mobile browser (i.e., telling the search engine that the
page is “mobile-friendly”). Check to make sure your site does not block access to
any of these files via robots.txt.
• If your site is dynamically serving desktop and mobile content based on the user
agent requesting the page, use the Vary HTTP header to signal your changes
depending on the user agent (http://bit.ly/dynamic_serving).
• If your site is hosting desktop and mobile content on separate (unique) URLs,
annotate the desktop page’s HTML by adding the rel="alternate" tag pointing to
the mobile URL, and annotate the mobile page’s HTML by adding the rel="canoni
cal" tag pointing to the desktop URL (http://bit.ly/separate_urls). This can also eliminate any potential duplicate content concerns between the two site versions.
• Publish only mobile-friendly content (Flash movies or Flash-based websites, for
example, are not compatible with mobile!).
• Include a mobile sitemap according to updated search engine guidelines. As of this
writing the most recent mobile sitemap format utilized by Google requires you to
include a specific tag (<mobile:mobile/>) for mobile URLs to be crawled. For more
information, refer to Google’s documentation on mobile sitemaps.
• Always test your pages in Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test Tool. This will enable you
to see if Google will treat your pages as mobile friendly in their search results.

Mobile site speed
Site speed is a crucial component of mobile SEO success, a point that has been driven
home by Google for a number of years now. You can find suggestions for your specific
site by using the following tools (the recommendations hold true regardless of
whether you choose a same URLs or separate URLs approach):
• Google Page Speed Insights
• Mobi Test from Akamai
• WebPageTest
• W3C’s Mobile OK Checker

App SEO: Deep Linking and Indexing for Mobile
Search
Based on the evolution of deep linking and indexation for mobile app content, significant opportunities have emerged for SEO exposure of mobile app content in the near
future. App SEO for organic search exposure (different from “App Store SEO,” which
has generally referred to optimizing mobile apps for prominence within Apple’s App
Store and Google Play) provides a massive opportunity for content discovery via the
indexation and ranking of deep content residing within mobile apps. As we have
learned over the years with website content delivered via search, as deeper, more targeted content is delivered to a searcher, content (in this instance, app) engagement
increases, time to conversion decreases, and search engine results improve.
Various technology companies are targeting the app-specific search landscape. URX
has built a deep-link app search API, whereby developers can monetize apps or websites with deep links to contextually relevant in-app content and actions in other apps.
In other words, URX has built a search engine that developers use to find a deep link
into an app for a specific context. Quixey has built a search engine that relies upon
deep linking to help users find the most relevant content within apps in the same way
that search engines help users find the most relevant content within websites. Google
is also actively including App content in its search results. Coauthor Eric Enge has
interviewed Google’s Mariya Moeva on this topic.

App Deep Linking
The indexation of deep-linked content within apps (in-app pages) and the delivery of
this content to mobile searchers have opened a world of possibility for apps and the
mobile users who use them. In its most basic definition, app deep linking enables a link
to send a user (or a search engine crawler) to deep, targeted content within an app
(such as a specific page, tab, or view) based on his intent, as opposed to sending him to
the app’s home page—something we take for granted on desktop when we share
deep-linked content from various websites or when we click on a link in search
results. In essence, deep links take the user directly to what he wants to do within the
app, increasing app engagement, decreasing the time to conversion for targeted in-app

behaviors, and improving the relevance of results in mobile search. All things considered, the mobile search ecosystem is poised to support this trend of driving intentbased traffic to mobile apps.
Deep linking to in-app pages and functionality also allows users to share deep content
across various platforms (email, social sharing, SMS), further increasing engagement
levels. And from an SEO perspective, it is likely that we will eventually see external
linking, social, and other engagement signals applied to deep-linked app URLs much in
the same way that we see them applied to website URLs in SEO today.

Deep linking URL schemes
In order to provide deep links to your in-app content, you will need to create a unique
URL scheme with routing parameters (path, query string, etc.) representing the custom actions to take within the app, register these with the operating system, and map
the routes to content destinations or user actions within the app. An example of a
deep linking scheme with a routing parameter is twitter://timeline. When entered into a
mobile browser, this opens the Twitter app and links directly to the device user’s timeline.
URX and MobileDeepLinking.org provide helpful tutorials on deep linking for both the
novice and the app developer.

Deep linking standards
Deep linking standards attempt to define for app developers how to create in-app URL
schemes so that the various platforms that publish these URLs can understand them.
There are various cross-platform standards, as outlined by these providers:
• Facebook’s App Links
• Twitter’s App Card
• Google’s App Indexing
• Quixey’s AppURL
• MobileDeepLinking.org

Deep linking tracking and optimization opportunities
Increasingly, tools are being developed to provide deep linking capabilities as well as
acquisition data “outside the app,” filling a historical gap within traditional mobile app
analytics solutions and enabling app marketers to utilize user intent metrics—which
can provide greater insight into organic attribution and drive intent-based content
delivery.

642

A sampling of these tools includes:

Tapstream
Marketing dashboard providing tools for deferred deep linking, onboarding links,
and A/B testing

Yozio
Platform offering solutions for deferred deep linking, dynamic linking, and A/B
testing
A quick note on tools that provide third-party URLs for deep links to your app content, as opposed to using your own app link URLs: there may come a time in the
future when it is smarter to develop your own deep link URLs for the same reason
that you develop your own URLs for your site content—so that social shares and
external links can be built over time and credited to your owned URL.

App Indexing
Google currently offers its App Indexing API to allow developers to notify Google
about deep links in their native apps, which Google uses to index content that it then
serves in mobile search results. Google also states that the App Indexing API allows the
Google App to drive reengagement through Google Search query autocompletions.
Bing currently indexes apps for search on Windows and Windows Phone via the Windows Phone Store URL.

Optimizing for Vertical Search
Vertical search refers to the search accessibility of various niches and formats of web
content (referred to as verticals), including images, videos, events, news, travel, products, music, and people (this has also been referred to as “universal” search in Google).
Google provides vertical search functionality, as do vertical-specific websites such as
Expedia.com and Cars.com. The term “vertical search” is often used interchangeably
with “blended search,” although this is not quite correct. Blended search results
include various types of vertical content, such as videos, images, and so on. SEO for
vertical search refers specifically to efforts to optimize vertical content types so they
appear prominently within vertical-specific search engines (Google Images search, for
example) and within blended search results. At this stage, Google and Bing provide
blended search results (in addition to their separate vertical search functions) to
improve the user experience and increase the overall search value to users in ways
that go beyond what traditional web search results have provided.

OPTIMIZING FOR VERTICAL SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

643

Generally speaking, blended search results can provide more relevant (and therefore
more valuable) content within specific verticals. Vertical-specific search engines still
exist, as Google and Bing provide numerous vertical-specific search functions;
however, we are also seeing an increasing trend toward the search engines incorporating vertical results within their main web search results.
A June 2014 study by Searchmetrics found that the proportion of keyword searches in
Google with Universal Search integrations (i.e., blended results) was 81% in 2013, up
from 75% in 2012, reflecting the ongoing opportunity for increased exposure in blended search results and vertical search. SEO professionals should seriously consider
what potential benefits vertical search optimization can provide to their, and their clients’, websites. There are very specific ways in which vertical content can be optimized
for success in these areas, as we will outline in this chapter.
Vertical search has been around for almost as long as the major search engines have
existed. Some of the first vertical search engines were for image search, newsgroup
search, and news search, but many other vertical search properties have emerged since
then, both from the major search engines and from third parties. This chapter will
focus primarily on strategies for optimizing your website for the vertical search offerings from Google and Bing.

Universal Search = Blended Search
Google’s web results search engine used to be a kind of vertical search engine itself:
one focused specifically on web pages (and not images, videos, news, blogs, etc.). In
May 2007, Google announced Universal Search—merging results from different types of
digital media, such as images and videos, within its search results. Other search
engines followed suit with similar search functionality, which is now referred to as
“blended search” as a search engine–neutral term within the industry.
With the advent of Universal Search, Google changed the “web page” search engine
into a search engine for any type of online content. Figure 10-2 shows Moz’s “MegaSERP” infographic, which reveals the wide array of search result types that can be
pulled into a regular web search in Google, as it now incorporates various algorithmic
and data components of its Knowledge Graph (or Carousel) into its main SERPs. Note
that Figure 10-2 shows not an actual search results page, but rather the universe of
vertical content types that can be pulled into general web search results.

Figure 10-3 shows an example of how blended search plays out in a Google SERP for a
search for iphone. Notice the news results (labeled “News for iphone”), the image
results (labeled “Images for iphone”), and the Shopping results (labeled “Shop for
iphone”—these are paid search results from advertisers). This SERP is an example of
vertical search results being incorporated right into traditional web search results.

The Opportunity Unleashed
As we noted at the beginning of this chapter, the opportunity in vertical search was
significant before the advent of blended search. However, that opportunity was not

OPTIMIZING FOR VERTICAL SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

647

fully realized because many (in fact, most) users were not even aware of the vertical
search properties. With the expansion of blended search, however, the opportunities
in optimization for vertical search have soared. By leveraging digital media assets such
as images, videos, articles, events, recipes, TV and product reviews, and local business
listings, businesses can increase their chances of having search result exposure that
may directly or indirectly drive traffic to their sites.

Optimizing for Local Search
In 2014, Google published a research study called “Understanding Consumers’ Local
Search Behavior”, which revealed numerous valuable insights into the state of local
search. Figure 10-5 shows the executive summary from this study.

Figure 10-5. Google local search study: executive summary

648

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

Google’s study also found that 56% of “on the go” searches have local intent, and 50%
of smartphone users and 34% of desktop/tablet users who perform a local search visit
a store within a day of their search. These valuable insights underscore the importance
of developing a local search strategy.
The major search engines have sought to increase their advertiser bases by moving
aggressively into providing local directory information. Applications such as Google’s
Google My Business and Bing Places for Business have introduced disruptive technology to local directory information by mashing up maps with directory listings, reviews
and ratings, local citations, satellite images, and 3D modeling—all tied together with
geotargeting and keyword search relevance. These innovations have excited users, and
the mapping interfaces are growing in popularity as a result.
While there is no single dominant provider of local business information on the Internet, Google, Bing, and Yahoo! have ramped up their efforts to tackle this market by
providing local listings within their search results—and thus have become the go-to
resources for local information. “Local SEO” has become a very complex and unique
subset within the SEO practice, and has even developed its own unique vernacular, for
which Moz has provided a helpful glossary. If you are hoping to gain traction in local
SEO, it would be wise to familiarize yourself (and/or those working on your local SEO
efforts) with the terminology in this glossary.
The opportunity for local search is huge. More than any other form of vertical search,
local search results have a major presence in web search. For example, Figure 10-6
shows the results for a search on minneapolis rental cars.
Only three regular web search results are above the fold, and the following results are
the “pack” of Google local search results (packs comprise three, five, or seven results).

Local Listing Submissions
Enhancing your local listing profiles in Google, Bing, and Yahoo! is a matter of providing as much relevant data to the search engines as you can. The most important elements to focus on are your business name, address, phone number, website, and categories. These are the elements that you can influence that carry the most weight in the

650

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

ranking algorithms. While adding a rich description can help with click-through rates
and conversions, it has very little, if any, weight in the ranking algorithms.
Here are some guidelines for making choices for these data elements:

Business name
Make sure you use an accurate business name. Do not try to add keywords or
locations—this is considered spam and may result in your listing being rejected.
Be sure to use the exact same business name that you use on your website, and in
any other online business profiles.

Address
Like the business name, your address is part of the “key” that the search engines
use to identify your business. It is helpful to ensure that the address “maps accurately” in the search engines. Do this by performing a search in each engine on
just your address. See if the engines show an exact match for your business
address; if they do not, you may need to modify it (for example, there may be
multiple ways a particular street is referred to, such as “Mc Andrew” versus
“McAndrew,” and you may have to try an alternate version), or you may need to
report a mapping error to the search engine directly. To do so, click on the “Report
a Problem” link, which can be found in several places on the map results—usually
at the bottom of the map, or underneath the business address within the map display.
It is also useful to ensure that the USPS considers your address to be correct. You
can check this with free tools available at https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!
input.action.

Phone number
For the “main” phone number, be sure to use a unique local phone number.
Avoid 800 numbers, and avoid tracking numbers if you do not plan to use them
on a long-term basis (i.e., for testing or other purposes). As with your business
name and address, your main phone number is part of the “key” the engines uses
to cross-reference information about your business around the Web. Using a nonlocal or frequently changing phone number can potentially confuse the search
engines and cause them to have less confidence in your listing. In addition, it can
lead to the creation of duplicate business profiles, which would compete against
your core listing for search engine rankings.

Website
In many cases, for a business with a single location, your website is simply your
home page. For businesses with multiple locations, it is ideal to have a separate
page representing each location.

OPTIMIZING FOR LOCAL SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

651

Be sure to provide the address and local phone number (as just described) on the
page you link to. It can be helpful to encode the contact information on the web
page using markup from Schema.org (http://schema.org/LocalBusiness or its industryspecific variants) or microformats (http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard). You can also
use the Google Search Console Data Highlighter to “tag” the organization data on
your pages in lieu of markup if you are not able to modify your web pages easily,
but note that this will only serve to inform Google, not Bing or Yahoo!.
Having a website can be a strong ranking factor for the search engines, and it can
be a strong factor in converting searchers to customers. It is advised that you provide at least a basic website associated with your business listing. Of course, if you
do so, you will also want to follow much of the other advice in this book to optimize that website.

Description
Google now provides you with a description field that allows 4,000+ characters,
which should be plenty of space to describe your business and promote your message. Make sure you provide a well-written, unique description of your business.
While Google states that it no longer relies upon the business description for ranking purposes, it is still important to accurately describe your service, product, and
location specifics for users.

Categories
Category selection provides a very strong clue for the search engine to determine
what kinds of searches your business is relevant to. The best advice here is to simply study the available categories, and be sure that the first one you choose is the
“best” category. At least one category selection must be made from the search
engines’ standard set of categories. Google and Bing allow for up to 10 categories,
and Yahoo! allows for 5.
If you use your own categories, be sure to follow the search engine quality guidelines. Mainly, be sure to list categories that describe what the business is (as
opposed to, for example, what products it sells or where it is located). Also, keep
each category focused on a unique quality of the business. Do not attempt to jam
keywords into your category choices, as the engines may consider this to be spam
and reject your listing.

652

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

One good source for brainstorming categories is to examine the business listing
pages of some competitors and see what they’ve chosen. It is helpful to be seen in
the same categories as the majority of your competitors. This ensures that the
engines consider your business as “the same type” as your main competitors,
allowing you to be considered for display in the most important search results.
In addition to these key elements, your business profile can include information on
your business hours and accepted payment methods, photos, videos, and other data
items. Providing this extra information is worth the effort, as it enriches your business
page and may help entice more users to contact you. It also opens up additional
opportunities to provide keywords and context to help the search engines better
understand how to rank your business.
NOTE
Your business’s name, address, and phone number (NAP) are perhaps the most
critical components of your local listing data that contribute to local ranking, so
it’s critical to keep this information consistent throughout your web presence and
across your local listings. Most businesses go through normal transitions that
require NAP information changes (business location changes, contact phone
number changes, etc.). Be sure to update your NAP information on your website,
your local listings, and your third-party platform pages (YouTube, Facebook, etc.)
after any of these transitions, and periodically monitor your NAP information for
consistency.

Google My Business
In June 2014, Google announced the launch of Google My Business (GMB) in an
effort to streamline and simplify the management of local business profiles—which
had evolved into an increasingly complex and time-consuming array of business listing
options and locations under the umbrella of Google properties. According to Google,
businesses that have existing Google Places listings and Google+ Local Pages will automatically be upgraded to the GMB platform. At the launch of this service, Google
added the ability to “View the Business on Google,” which gives you a preview of your
business info in Google Search, Maps, and Google My Business. The opening page for
Google My Business is shown in Figure 10-7.
More information about Google My Business can be found on its FAQ page.

Optimizing your GMB listing(s)
It is worth investing the time to learn how to optimize for GMB. One thing that may
surprise you: if your business has been around for any length of time, Google probably
already knows about it and has a listing in place. Google is very good at gathering and
aggregating data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive representation of
your business.
As of this writing, you will likely find this listing in a local SERP within the local pack
with a link to a GMB page for your business. If Google has generated such a default
listing for you, you should claim this GMB listing (rather than creating a new one). Do
so by clicking on the “Manage This Page” link that appears on your business’s GMB
page (underneath “Is This Your Business?”) and following the prompts, which will
include creating a GMB account.
Claiming the listing will allow you to take control of the profile information for your
business (the business name, address, and phone numbers(s), as well as a vast set of
other data elements, including the website address, the business categories you should
be associated with, photos, etc.). Claiming is relatively straightforward. Before granting
you control, Google will have you prove you own the business being claimed. You will
receive a secret code either through a postcard that’s mailed to your business address
or in a live phone call from a Google robot. You then enter this code into the portal,
and Google grants you exclusive control of the listing. You may also be able to
instantly verify your GMB listing through Google Search Console; for this option, the
website listed on the GMB profile must be verified in Google Search Console with the
same email address you are using to claim the GMB profile. You can also batch-upload
listings if needed; see http://bit.ly/bulk_mgmt.

As mentioned, it is almost always better to claim an existing listing, if there is one,
than to create a new one. Local search engines struggle with duplication of listings, so
it is best if you do your part to ensure that there is only a single listing representing
your business. In fact, an advanced technique that you may want to explore is to
search Google Maps using your business name, address, and phone number to see if
there are any duplicates or near-duplicates of your business information, and if so, to
claim those as well. Doing so will help Google consolidate this information, and you
will benefit from having several “weaker” listings consolidated into a single strong
listing.
By taking control of your GMB listing, you’ve taken the first significant step toward
improving your ranking in Google local search. Google will likely have more confidence in your listing data immediately, because you have proven ownership and asserted control. This confidence is a key ranking factor, as one very important function of
local search engines is to cull the most accurate, up-to-date data from among the sea
of conflicting information that defines the local business information landscape. You
are now poised to take the next steps in optimizing your listing.

Google Knowledge Graph Carousel
A recent eye tracking study by Mediative revealed some interesting data on clickthrough rates for search results showing a Google Knowledge Graph Carousel (see
Figure 10-8).

Figure 10-8. Local search result showing a Carousel

According to the study, the highest-performing Carousel results were the ones at the
far right of the display, not those in the traditional 1, 2, or 3 positioning on the left.
While this is just a single study, it shows the challenges that a new visual interface can
create with regard to traditional user behavior.
As you can see in Figure 10-9, a search for minneapolis pizza is heavily biased toward
local results, and Google’s implementation of local Carousel results is displayed at the
top. These Carousel results are sourced from the same set of data as regular local
“pack” results; however, more results are displayed than the traditional pack of three,
five, or seven. This graphic display, which appeared in mobile/tablet results in 2013,
presents a new set of challenges and opportunities for business owners. It’s important
to note that Carousel has not affected all local results.

According to an October 2013 study by BrightEdge, Google Carousel impacted 14% of
keywords across all industries, with Travel and Hospitality verticals being most affected, as shown in Figure 10-10.

Inclusion within the Google Carousel (a.k.a. Knowledge Graph) is available for
authoritative sources for organizations, events, movie reviews, and music/video play
actions and requires the use of structured data markup, as outlined by Google’s Developers Guide to Structured Data.
As mentioned earlier, Google also provides the Data Highlighter within Google Search
Console, which enables webmasters and site owners to “tag” structured data on site
pages so that it can potentially appear as “rich snippets” of content within Google
search results. While webmasters have always been able to mark up structured data
using various formats, with Data Highlighter now they can do so solely for Google’s
use without having to modify their site’s pages on the server. Additional information
about Google’s handling of rich snippets and structured data can be found here: http://
bit.ly/structured_data_mrkup.
Currently, Google supports rich snippets for the following content types:
• Reviews
• People
• Products
• Businesses and organizations
• Recipes
• Events
• Music
Chapter 13 provides more detail on using the Data Highlighter tool.

Bing Places for Business
Bing also enables businesses to create local listings for consideration in the organic
search results with Bing Places for Business, which replaced the Bing Business Portal
in April 2013. If you already have a Google My Business listing, Bing allows you to
import that listing into its Places for Business interface to streamline the process (http://
bit.ly/manage_listing). Bing also allows businesses to upload up to 10,000 business locations in one step. Figure 10-11 shows the splash screen for Bing Places for Business.

Figure 10-11. Bing Places for Business

Listing your business in Bing provides you with yet another angle from which to
appear in Bing search results, according to Bing’s Duane Forrester:
It can be a way to double dip in the SERP, as [a business’s] Places listing data
can appear, with [it] ranked up top in the organic stack.
Bing also allows you to add links to your business’s various social media profiles, so be
sure to take advantage of this opportunity and list your Twitter and Facebook URLs.

Yahoo! Local
Yahoo! has been undergoing a steady evolution away from search as a core business
function. However, it still provides value to businesses via its Small Business channel
with its Local Marketing services, Localworks (local business listings in Yahoo! and 40+
directories), Mobile Offer Ads (mobile advertising), and Yahoo Gemini (its mobile
search and native ad platform).
You can create a free Yahoo! Local Basic Listing, which includes your business’s
address, phone number, brief description, and URL; or for $9.95 per month you can

OPTIMIZING FOR LOCAL SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

659

create a Local Enhanced Listing, which enables you to add a longer business description, multiple web links, and special offers/coupons.
Yahoo! also provides a mass-directory listing service called Yahoo! Localworks, which
lists your business in 40+ directories including Yahoo! Local, Yelp, WhitePages, Bing,
MapQuest, and Superpages; enables you to add videos and photos to your listing; and
lets you track your listing performance with analytics.

Directories and aggregators
Directories can be built from the local phone company’s database information, but no
single phone company covers the entire country. For this reason, companies that host
nationwide directories are primarily getting their content from data aggregators to form
the foundation of their guides. Data aggregators build their content from a variety of
sources, such as local-area print yellow pages, to have information that is as comprehensive as possible.
There are three top aggregators for U.S. business listings: Infogroup, Acxiom, and Neustar/Localeze. The first step in managing your local business’s online presence is to
check and update the business’s listing information in each of these main aggregators.
Ensure that the business name, address information, phone numbers, fax numbers,
and any other contact information are correct. If you have multiple locations, make
sure they’re all listed.
In addition to checking for listing accuracy, it is important to address duplicate data
issues at the data aggregator and local search publisher levels. Andrew Shotland,
founder of Local SEO Guide, wrote an invaluable white paper for Yext on this topic
entitled “The Definitive Guide to Duplicate Listings”.

Business Website Optimization for Local Search
If you have been around for a while, your business probably is already included in the
local search engines, as they compile data from the aggregators and other online directories. Once your business’s listing is loaded into the local engines, you must determine how to get your business’s website to rank higher when users search for your
industry’s keywords. On the next few pages, we will outline things you can do on
your website to achieve better rankings in local search engines.
All of the basic SEO factors can come into play here and help to influence your rankings. These factors include having good, specific text in each page’s title tag, <h1> tags,
meta description, page content, alt attributes, inbound links, and so forth. But some
aspects are specific to local search, such as the following:
• If your company has multiple locations, it is not necessary to have a standalone
website or subdomain (e.g., loc1.example.com, loc2.example.com, loc3.example.com) for

660

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

each outlet. In fact, it is probably better if you don’t, because each business location would likely produce similar website content. However, it probably would be
helpful for you to create a separate profile web page on your site for each distinct
location. Many sites with chain outlets list all outlets on one page—that is not
optimal. It is better to have one page dedicated to each store location so that you
can leverage all the on-page elements for that location. One caveat: you will want
to have a different phone number listed for each location, preferably with a local
area code (as opposed to a generic 800 number).
• Have your page title, <h1> tags, and content include the business name, the type of
business, and the location—for example, “Acme Café: French Restaurant in Boston, MA.” For multiple locations, make the title different on each location’s page.
Include the phone number, neighborhood, street address, area nicknames, and
other location-distinguishing information.
• The home page and/or Contact Us page should have the main location’s basic listing information (street address, city, state, zip code, phone numbers, etc.) displayed somewhere in the HTML text. You should also add the basic listing information in the Schema.org Organization or LocalBusiness format or the hCard
microformat (these are methods for encoding address information on web pages;
you can learn more about them in “Schema.org” on page 386 and at http://
schema.org or http://microformats.org). If you have multiple locations, display the
basic information on each location’s profile page. Google also accepts RDFa for this
information (as well as tagging via Data Highlighter in Google Search Console).
The Schema.org approach is the one we recommend, as this is a standard that has
been agreed upon by Google, Bing, and Yahoo! since 2011.
• Place differentiating information on each store’s pages, including items such as a
map, hours of operation, brand names of products carried, product photos, “in
business since <year>” information, menus with prices (for a restaurant), ratings
(if applicable), certifications, bonded status, and so on. As mentioned previously,
be sure to include specifics about the physical location.
• In the second edition of this book, we discussed the concept of centroid (the location that the search engine defines as the center of the city). Many of the map
search engines used to primarily display the businesses located closest to the centroid first for any particular category or keyword search. However, centroid is being
replaced by business/searcher distance as a ranking factor, as the distance of a
business from a searcher is more significant.
• Proximity works the same way for zip codes. If a user searches for businesses
within a specific zip code, the businesses closest to the zip code area centroid will
likely be displayed first in the list. Note, though, that zip code searches are not
commonly performed in the United States (you can verify this with your favorite
keyword research tool).

• Do not attempt to set up multiple user accounts to rate yourself well or reduce
your competition’s ratings! Likewise, do not pay customers for beneficial reviews
—if such a practice were discovered, you could lose all of your beneficial ratings.
Focus on working in ways that are allowed under all the search engines’ rules:
just ask people to rate you.
— By asking enough happy clients to rate you, you might be able to drive up the
positive reviews, which can bring rankings benefits. It is worth the effort to
identify your happy customers and ask them to write reviews for you at one or
more of the major directory sites. Never offer to pay for or otherwise incentivize positive reviews, however!
— Consider doing post-sales surveys to find those happy customers, and then
reach out to them to ask them to post reviews. You can offer to enter reviewers
into a drawing to win a prize, but don’t make their participation in the drawing
contingent on a positive review and don’t pay for each review. Monitor your
online ratings in the various sites as part of good reputation management and
try to respond to complaints/issues as quickly as possible. Consider using an
online review monitoring tool such as Review Push and Review Trackers.
• Links from local directories and other locally relevant sites (local “citations”) are
increasingly important ranking factors, and should be obtained when relevant.
• For businesses such as restaurants, it may be beneficial to add photos of celebrities
who have visited the establishment. People perform searches on celebrity names
all the time, so if you are lucky enough to have celebrities frequent your restaurant, uploading photos of them can help attract celebrity watchers to your business. However, be sure to get permission before using the celebrity’s photograph
or “likeness” in your advertising or promotional materials, as without it you may
be inviting a lawsuit. With permission, a celebrity photo endorsement can drive
up inbound links and get users to linger longer on the site, perhaps bolstering the
site’s quality scores.
• Community interaction can assist in online promotion. One great way to obtain
local area links is to support charitable efforts in the area and to sponsor local
events. Although it may seem crass to get link value out of charitable efforts, this
is one of the best ways to support your local community while bolstering your
business in the online marketplace. Don’t feel guilty for creating a win-win situation! Such opportunities could include:
— Local charity races/walks, particularly if they list sponsors or sponsor logos on a
page on their site. Request to have those linked to your local business site.
Inbound links from these sites are very beneficial, and this is a valid way to get
them!

662

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

— Local college or high school sports teams and bands. You can request that
sponsors are listed on the school website, if this isn’t done already.
— Local fraternal organizations (e.g., the Freemasons, Lions Club, and Shriners).
— Charitable events that you host yourself. Is anyone organizing the provision of
food for the needy at Thanksgiving? If not, organize it yourself and host the
information pages off your own website. This could draw many others to link
to you as they help in promotion efforts.
NOTE
A special thanks to John Biundo and David Mihm for their contributions to
the “Optimizing for Local Search” on page 648 section of this chapter in
the second edition, and to Andrew Shotland and Dan Leibson from Local
SEO Guide for their invaluable assistance with updates to this section in
the third edition.

Optimizing for Image Search
According to the aforementioned Searchmetrics study, in 2013, images were displayed
45% of the time in Google SERPs, more frequently than any other blended search elements. Optimizing for image search can be a smart strategy for many search marketers. Even if you’re working on a site that you don’t feel truly lends itself to an image
optimization strategy, you may be able to leverage images or photos on your website
for SEO.
However, we should note that for some sites, there may not be a lot to gain here.
Some etailers report poor conversion on image search traffic, and there is always the
concern over third parties stealing their images. You need to weigh the benefit of
image search capability against the costs and other opportunities for SEO on your site.
Nonetheless, many sites do very well with image search, and image search optimization does not have to take much time.
A significant amount of traffic can come from image search, and the number of people
competing effectively for that traffic is much lower than it is in general web search.
Industries that don’t immediately seem to provide compelling subjects for images may
enjoy greater potential in this area, because the competition might never clue in to the
advantages of integrating images into their sites and into an overall search marketing
strategy.
There are a few different ways that image search optimization can help to improve
traffic and conversions for your site:

OPTIMIZING FOR IMAGE SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

663

Subtle reputation management
Images of your products, services, or facility assist consumers during the research
phase of their shopping, and lend an implicit message of openness/forthrightness
to your business. Providing images can improve consumer confidence in your
company, increasing the chances that they’ll decide to do business with you.

Sales via image search results
Increasingly, consumers are searching for products via image search engines
because they can rapidly find what they are seeking without having to dig
through promotion-laden websites. If your products can be found in the image
search engine, you have an improved chance of being found by those people.
With no pictures, there’s zero chance of your site being found in image search.

Increased chances of showing up in Universal Search/blended search results
Performing image search optimization improves your chances of showing up in
additional positions on the main search results pages, as Universal Search pulls
image search content into the main SERPs for some keyword search terms.

Site/business promotion opportunities
If you have a flexible enough organization and you hold the legal copyrights to
your images, you can allow others to reuse the images in return for promotion of
your site/business.

Image Optimization Tips
In comparison to indexing pages that are rich with text content, indexing images is
much more difficult for search engines to perform. The image itself provides few clues
to the content within it. Google is experimenting with artificial intelligence algorithms
to improve detection of image content. For example, you can drag the image of a wellknown person or place onto the Google Images search box, and Google will attempt to
identify the contents and show you similar images.
Search engines are also experimenting with techniques such as optical character recognition (OCR) to read text content within images, but most images don’t have any text
to read. Search engines also use facial recognition software to determine when an
image is of a face versus a body, or something else entirely.
However, although these types of technologies are very useful, they are limited in
terms of what they can do, partly because they are computationally very expensive
and therefore not practical to use at the scale of the entire Web. For that reason, success in image search optimization depends on using all the signals available to you to
increase the search engines’ confidence in the content of your images.
This certainly includes the basic SEO techniques we have discussed in this book. The
web page’s title tag, the <h1> heading tag, the on-page content, and links to the page

664

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

are all factors in image ranking. For example, if you have a picture of the Golden Gate
Bridge as the single image on a page, and the title, headings, and content of the page
all support that, the search engines’ confidence in the content of the image increases.
The same is true if you have 10 images on a page of many different bridges, and their
content is reinforced by the title, headings, and page content. Consistency of content
and theme is important in all of SEO, but it is especially critical in image SEO.
In terms of the page content, you should give particular emphasis to the text immediately preceding and following the image. This is what the user most closely associates
with the image, and the search engine will view it the same way. A descriptive caption
underneath the image is helpful.
You can do a number of things to further optimize your images. Here are the most
important:
• Make sure the image filename or img src string contains your primary keyword. If
it is a picture of Abraham Lincoln, name the file abe-lincoln.jpg and/or have the src
URL string contain that keyword, as in http://example.com/abe-lincoln/portrait.jpg.
• Always use the alt attribute for images. This attribute helps the vision-impaired to
understand your site, and search engines use it to better understand what your
images are about. Our recent research indicates that this feature is still not used
for lots of sites’ images, and that many sites have tried to use it with invalid
HTML. Make sure the alt parameter is valid, as in this example:
<img alt="Abe Lincoln" src="http://example.com/abe-lincoln.jpg"/>

Use the quotes if you have spaces in the text string of the alt content! Sites that
have invalid <img> tags frequently drop a few words without quotes into the <img>
tag when they were intended for the alt attribute. Omitting the quotes is a common problem; without them, all terms after the first will be lost, if any are used at
all.
• Avoid query strings for img src tags, just as you should for page URLs. Or, if you
must use URLs that include query strings, use no more than two or three parameters. Consider rewriting the query strings in the URLs so that they do not contain
an excessive number of parameters, which will cause spiders to refuse to crawl the
links. Although Google claims to no longer have problems with these types of situations, it is better to be safe than sorry.
• Use good-quality pictures, which will read well when shown in thumbnail format.
Good contrast is typically the key here. Lower-contrast images are visually harder
to read, and it is common sense that if the thumbnail image doesn’t look good, it
will not invite a click.
• Do not save images as graphics files with embedded thumbnails—turn this feature
off in Photoshop and other image editing software. Search engines may copy your

OPTIMIZING FOR IMAGE SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

665

image, reduce it in size, save it in compressed format, and deliver up a thumbnail
of it for their results pages. An embedded thumbnail can wreak havoc with some
compression software, and it increases your file size slightly, so just leave that feature disabled.
• Don’t store the image in a sidebar column with your ads or inside the header/
footer navigation elements; otherwise, the search engine algorithms will ignore
the image as irrelevant, just as they ignore page decor and navigation graphics.
• Have a proper copyright license! You need to have a proper license to display the
images found on your site so that you don’t get sued. Be careful about trying to
use images from Wikimedia Commons or other public stock photo sites, as you
cannot be sure that those images really are in the public domain. For example,
when you “purchase” an image from a stock photo site, you are not purchasing
the copyright—you are purchasing the right to use the image. More often than
not, these arrangements require that you link back to the copyright holder.
• You need to ensure that your server configuration allows your site’s images to be
displayed when called from web pages on other domains. Some system administrators have disabled this setting to keep people from displaying their images on
other sites, and this could cause problems if you want your images displayed in
search engine image results pages. Likewise, make sure that your robots.txt file
does not block the crawlers from accessing your image file directories.
• If it is a fit for your business, specify that others are free to use your images for
online display as long as they link back to your website from a credit line below or
adjacent to the image, where they display your copyright notice. Enabling others
to use your photos invites more promotional attention when people wish to write
about you in blogs or in news articles.
It is also a good idea to create an image XML sitemap to highlight images you consider
particularly important, or to help the search engines find images that might otherwise
be difficult for their crawlers to discover. Read more on image XML sitemaps at http://
bit.ly/adding_images or in the section “Image sitemaps” on page 265.
With the advent of blended search and the Web’s overall movement toward more visually compelling, image-rich content, there are more opportunities to achieve organic
exposure with images—and the area is also becoming more competitive. The following
is a list of image optimization best practices to use when uploading your images to
image sharing sites such as Flickr. These tips will help ensure your image files have the
best chance of appearing for targeted, qualified searches in the SERPs:
• When you upload your photos, always add tags. The tags or keywords that you
associate with your photo will ensure users can find it when they are searching
and will lend keyword weight to the photo’s page. Enter as many tags as possible

666

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

that accurately describe your photo. Make sure you place any multiword tags
within quotation marks (e.g., “pickup truck”). The Flickr Tag Cloud, Flickr’s usertag “folksonomy,” generates a good link navigation system for both users and
search engine spiders.
• This should be obvious, but have your photos publicly viewable, not restricted to
viewing by only your friends and family.
• Create a descriptive title for the image. This adds yet more keyword weight to the
photo’s page within Flickr.
• Enter a description under the photo, or write something about the picture.
• Consider adding a note or two directly onto the photo, particularly if it is humorous. Flickr allows you to select a rectangular area and associate some text with it
that will appear as a tool tip when users mouse over it. Adding a humorous/interesting note or two may encourage users to participate on your photo’s page, and
the greater a page’s level of participation/stickiness, the better quality score that
page may attain.
• Ensure that photo geotagging is enabled (where applicable) for locally oriented
images.
• Create thematic sets for your photos, and add each picture to the set(s) appropriate for it. This provides yet more contextual clues for search engines regarding the
content of the photo’s page, and it will allow a user arriving at the page to easily
find similar pictures you’ve taken.
• Browse through Flickr’s Groups for public “photo album” collections that are dedicated to pictures that could be related to your photo. Sometimes it helps to search
for photos using keywords you have used in your tags, and then see what groups
other people’s photos belong to.
• Join those groups, and then add your photos apropos to each group’s theme. The
more links there are to your photo page, the more important your photo will be
considered, so add it to a number of groups. Ideally, add it to groups that have a
lot of members—the number of members indicates the popularity and traffic of
the group.
• Link each of your Flickr photo pages to your website, or a related page on your
site. You can add hyperlinks to the Description field below the photo. Use anchor
text that has a call to action, or that tells the user what to expect if he clicks on the
link (e.g., “We sell this product on our website”; “Enjoy this view from the tables
at our restaurant”; “This room is available at our bed & breakfast”). It is best to
link to specific pages of related content as a richer indicator for link juice transfer.
• Post as many optimized pictures as possible. This is mostly a game of many small
fractions adding up to large, cumulative results. The many pages of pictures link-

OPTIMIZING FOR IMAGE SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

667

ing back to your site will help build your overall authority. The more pages you
have, the more likely it is that other Flickr users will find your content and link to
it. This also increases your chances that a lucky picture or two might find their
way onto a viral popularity wave that spurs many users to send links of your picture to their friends, or that a reporter might find one of your pictures ideal for
her news story.
Many of these suggestions can generally be applied to images used on third-party
social media platforms that heavily leverage images, such as Pinterest, which has
become one of the leading referrers of ecommerce traffic on the Web. For these types
of sites, be sure to use descriptive filenames and alt text, write keyword-rich descriptions, and make ample and appropriate use of hashtags.

Optimizing for Google Shopping Search
Google Product Search is now called Google Shopping. The aforementioned 2014
Searchmetrics study reported a 182% increase in 2013 in the total number of Shopping integrations in Google SERPs over the previous year. The biggest change within
Google Shopping (besides the name) is that all product results now come from product
listing ads—sponsored results for which Google collects a fee for every click. Google
Shopping results have gained significant prominence within the SERPs, frequently
appearing above the organic results and even pushing text ads down the page (see
Figure 10-12). This makes it especially important for online retailers to optimize product visibility in Google Shopping.

668

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

Figure 10-12. Google Shopping result for “canon powershot”

There are two main steps to list your products on Google Shopping:
1. Submit a product feed through the Google Merchant Center.
2. Create Product Listing Ads through Google AdWords.

Submitting a Product Feed
To be included in Google Shopping search, you need to upload a product feed that
contains true physical/tangible products. The Google Merchant Center will accept
other types of items, such as flights, hotels, car rentals, travel packages, and real estate,
but such items will not get into Google Shopping search.
The latest technical specifications for submitting a product feed to the Google Merchant Center can be found online at http://bit.ly/products_feed_specs. It is crucial to follow
these requirements closely and to provide as much relevant data as possible to ensure
Google can read what is in the feed and understand what products you’re selling. The
more data Google has about your products, the better it will be able to show your list-

OPTIMIZING FOR GOOGLE SHOPPING SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

669

ings at the right time. In your feed, populate as many fields as possible with available
product data (Brand, Category, Color, Price, Condition, etc.).
In addition to uploading accurate data, it is important to keep your feed data current,
with the latest availability, pricing, and other specifications, to reduce the error rate
and improve the chance that Google trusts your data (many merchants update their
feeds daily). If the data in your feed does not match what Google finds on your landing pages, your feed quality will be lower, and it will be less likely that your products
will appear in the SERPs for product queries. When in doubt, check your Google Merchant Center account to see how many errors Google finds in your feed, and either
correct as many as possible or delete the products that are causing the feed errors.

Optimizing a Product Feed
Once your product feed is accepted, Google uses it to match your products to searches
for those items. The extent to which Google’s search engine correctly understands
what products you sell is largely dependent on what you’ve put in your feed, and various optimization tactics can help you receive more impressions for relevant, productrelated queries.

Optimize the title
Titles should contain your target keywords and be descriptive and concise. For example, for apparel you should include the brand, style, and gender. While you’re allowed
150 characters, try to fit the most important words in the first 70 characters in case
Google truncates it (see Figure 10-13). A strong title that will fit nicely in the limited
space provided by ads might be “Red Wing Men’s Oxford 133.” Avoid overly descriptive or editorial language like “High Quality & Gorgeous North Face Down Jacket.”
Google prefers simple and product-focused language because that’s what users prefer
to see in the Shopping results.

Figure 10-13. Google Shopping result for “microwave ovens” showing product titles

670

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

Optimize the description
The optimal description length is between 500 and 1,000 characters, much shorter
than the 5,000-character limit of the field. Like your product title, product descriptions
should not be overly editorial or promotional, but rather include your keywords and
specific attributes of the product—preferably near the start of the field in the event it
gets truncated. The description should be grammatically correct and end with a punctuation mark. For products with variants (e.g., items that come in different colors),
avoid listing the specifics of any of those variants, and instead state that the product
comes in other colors. This can prevent inconsistencies between images and descriptions; for example, if you list a shirt and say it’s available in green and red, Google may
show the red shirt to a user searching for a green one.

Use correct product identifiers
Unique product identifiers (UPIs) are some of the most important attributes in your
feed, yet they’re also the ones most often submitted incorrectly. There are three types
of UPIs—GTIN, MPN, and Brand—and most products require that two of the three be
submitted using industry standard values.
The UPI that you submit for one of your products should be the same value that a
competitor submits for that product, because these numbers are universal and Google
uses them to match products to queries. If you’re making up UPIs or submitting the
“Identifier Exists” attribute for custom goods incorrectly, Google can’t group your
products correctly and you could be missing out on potential impressions.
The Identifier Exists attribute should be used for custom-made goods only; if that’s not
the case for your goods, you must get the proper UPI from the product manufacturer.
Google will disapprove products that use incorrect UPIs.

Use the correct Google product category
Download the Google Product Taxonomy and make sure every product is categorized
as specifically as possible. Using a more generic category won’t get you more visibility.
Google’s goal is to show the most relevant results, so by giving your product the most
specific categorization, you help Google better group it with similar products and map
it to the most relevant queries. Google product categories are similar to UPIs in that
you and your competitors should be submitting the same values for each product.
Google updates the product taxonomy every three months, so check back periodically
to make sure that your products are still well categorized. If you find that your product
is not showing for the right queries, experiment with the title, description, product
identifiers, and categorization to improve your relevance for those missed queries.

Use appealing images
The image is the biggest visual element that users see in Shopping results, so you
should submit a visually appealing, high-resolution image that clearly shows the product. You can submit up to 10 additional images in addition to the main image to show
the product from different angles, in different settings, or with different packaging. If
you find that your listings have a low click-through-rate (CTR), experiment with
image rotation.

Submit a special offer with a promotion feed
When you’re selling the same product as multiple competitors, the availability of a
special offer is one of the few ways to differentiate your product listing. Use the Google
Merchant Center to submit a separate feed with promotions such as discounts, free
shipping, or free add-ons.

Become a Google Trusted Store
Google adds a special logo next to any merchant who is a Google Trusted Store, giving
Trusted Store product listings more prominence at no additional cost (see
Figure 10-14).

Figure 10-14. Google Trusted Store “special offer” in Google Shopping

Promoting Products in AdWords
Because all shopping results are now sponsored, you will need to create product listing
ads for all of the products you want to promote. To get started, create a new Shopping
campaign in Google AdWords, and connect this campaign with your Merchant Center
account. You can do a quick and simple setup with a single campaign, ad group, and
product group that contains all products in the feed; more sophisticated setups take a
bit more time and effort, but are well worth it for the additional level of control they
provide over bidding and targeting.

672

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

To gain more control over how much you pay for a click and when your products
appear in the SERPs, you can put product listing ads into different campaigns, ad
groups, and product groups. This gives you greater control over settings like geotargeting, device bid modifiers, day parting, and negative keywords. Different bids can be set
for each product group so that you’re bidding the correct value for each type of
product.
If you create multiple Shopping campaigns in an account, you can take advantage of
an entirely new setting that’s exclusive to Shopping campaigns: the ability to set priorities of high, medium, or low. In the event that multiple campaigns are eligible to show
a shopping result, Google will show the product listing ad from the campaign with the
highest priority. For example, you can use this feature to set a higher priority for products that are on sale.

Reporting Results of Shopping Ads
AdWords has reports about all the key metrics such as clicks, impressions, cost, conversions, and conversion values driven by Shopping listings, helping you ensure your ads
are successful. Reports also include benchmark data about the average CPC and CTR of
competitors to help you see how your shopping ads perform in comparison.

Optimizing for Blog Search
News, video, and blog search provide tremendous opportunity for optimization. This
has a bearing not only on obtaining traffic directly from the search engines, but also in
promoting your business in whole new ways. Getting plugged in to news search, for
example, can bring you plenty of quality traffic, but it can also result in your site being
spotted by major media editors and writers, as well as bloggers who consume that
media. This is the type of exposure that can lead to numerous links.
Blogs and RSS feeds offer a similar dynamic of getting your content in front of new
readers through new channels. There is also a social aspect to blogging, due to the
built-in mechanism for comments and the tendency for bloggers to interact heavily
with each other.
Optimization for news and video search applies to a wide range of sites, and we’ll
come back to them later in the chapter. First, though, we’ll look at the optimization for
blog search.
Blogs are great publishing platforms for those who want to write articles on a regular
basis. First, they make it easy to publish the content. Authors need only to log in and
use a relatively simple set of menu choices to input what they want to publish, preview it, and then publish it. It is far easier than coding your own HTML pages by hand.

OPTIMIZING FOR BLOG SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

673

In fact, W3Techs has estimated that up to 60% of websites (from 24% of the Alexa Top
10 million sites) have been built using WordPress as the sole publishing platform.
WordPress is the world’s most popular blog platform, and the search engines historically have handled WordPress-based sites very well.
Blogs are inherently social in nature, so they offer a host of social marketing benefits.
Enabling comments allows for interaction with readers, and bloggers tend to have a
significant level of interaction. Working this aspect of blogging as a social media platform is beyond the scope of this book. Nonetheless, be aware that a blog is an opportunity to establish yourself as an expert in a topic area, and to engage in a give-and-take
activity that can dramatically change the visibility of your business.
In addition to these huge benefits, blogs can also bring you search engine and/or blog
search engine traffic when they are properly optimized.

Structural Blog Optimizations
As we have discussed throughout this book, there are many key elements to successful
SEO. These include things such as title tags, heading tags, good content, inbound
links, and SEO-friendly architecture. Although the various blog publishing platforms
are great, they can sometimes also require some tweaks to achieve optimal SEO
results:
• Blogs usually offer the ability to categorize each post. Make sure the tag name is
used in the title of that tag page.
• Override default title tags with custom ones. You can do this using one of the
best WordPress SEO plug-ins available, WordPress SEO by Yoast. Along with many
other SEO features, this plug-in allows you to supply a custom title tag, defined
through a custom field in a post or a page.
• Rewrite your URL to contain keywords, and to use hyphens (preferred over
underscores) as word separators. Do not let the blog platform include the date in
the URL.
• Make sure you 301-redirect from http://yourblog.com to http://www.yourblog.com (or
vice versa). Note that if you have a site at http://www.yourdomain.com and a blog at
http://www.yourdomain.com/blog, you may need to implement a separate redirect
just for the blog. This has to be handled not just for the home page, but also for all
internal pages (e.g., permalink pages). Each URL must redirect to the corresponding URL on the www version.
• If you change from one blog platform to another one, the URL structure of your
blog will likely change. If so, make sure you maintain legacy URLs by 301redirecting from each page’s old location to the new one.

674

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

Optimizing Your Anchor Text
Anchor text is just as important in blogging as it is in general SEO, and should also be
treated with an equal amount of caution (i.e., not overoptimized). Here are some
guidelines:
• Make the post’s title a link to the permalink page. You do not want your only link
to the post to say “Permalink.”
• Use a tool such as Open Site Explorer or Majestic to see who is linking to your
site. Using these tools or tools like them, you can see who is linking to you and
what anchor text they have used. Look for opportunities to request revisions to
anchor text on inbound links, but before making such a request make sure you
are confident that your relationship with the linker will not result in her simply
removing your link instead of changing it.
• Internally link back to old, relevant posts within the body of a blog post. Don’t use
here or previously or similar words as the anchor text; use something more descriptive for the user instead.

Sticky Posts
Sticky posts are a way to add content that always shows up first on a page of your
blog—for example, a post that serves as the introduction/overview for all the content
on one of your category pages. Using this technique, you can add keyword-rich introductory copy to a category page or tag page. WPMUDev.org, a WordPress developer
and resource site, offers a tutorial on how to create and style sticky posts.

Author Profile Pages
If you have a multiauthor blog, another smart tactic is to create author profile pages.
This has a multitude of benefits. First, many of your readers will have a stronger interest in one writer than in the others. Better still, offer RSS feeds on a per-author basis.
In addition, the authors are likely to link back to their author pages on your blog from
their own sites.
Figure 10-15 is an example of an author profile page.

OPTIMIZING FOR BLOG SEARCH

Figure 10-15. An author profile page

Links
Obtaining links and managing your link juice remain critical activities. Blog platforms
provide limited ability to manage your internal link juice, so this may require some
customization to accomplish. Fortunately, in the WordPress environment, some really
good plug-ins are available to help you with this.
For starters, you can also create cross-links between related posts using a plug-in such
as WordPress Related Posts. This is a great way to get people who just finished reading
one post on your blog to consider reading another one. Finally, develop relationships
with other blog and article authors, and get them interested in your content; hopefully, they will follow your work and offer relevant citations when the opportunity
arises.

Optimizing for News Search: Google News
As a major traffic driver to news-based web content, Google News should be at the top
of your list for news search optimization. Google News offers publishers visibility
beyond just the Google News site, as Publisher articles will also show up in regular
Google searches. Certain queries around headline news and current events will trigger
Google to show a fresher set of results. Some of these articles are presented in a cluster
and labeled “In the news,” which gives publishers the opportunity for their most
recent articles to appear at or near the top of the results page.
There are many types of queries that will trigger a “news box.” Examples are disasters
(tsunamis, earthquakes, storms), attacks (school shootings, terrorists), elections, holidays, significant sporting events (Olympics, World Cup, Superbowl), large brand
names, and deaths of notable persons. Figure 10-16 shows a news box inserted at the
top of the SERP for the query ebola.
Until very recently, news clusters in search results contained only articles from
approved publishers accepted into Google News. In October 2014, Google began
including other sources in the news box as well, such as reddit, Twitter, or very small
niche sites.

Acceptance Criteria
Publishers must meet very strict quality standards to be accepted into Google News,
and these standards are strongly enforced (both for getting in and for staying in). In
Google’s News Publisher Help section, Google outlines its News requirements in detail.
You should read through these guidelines very carefully before applying.
Here are some of the general requirements:
• Your site must contain clearly accessible contact information, including a physical
address, phone numbers, and email.
• If your site has a common publication name, there is likely already a publisher in
Google News with the same name. You will need to submit your site with a
unique name. For example, the Star Tribune submitted its publication name as
Minneapolis Star Tribune. Be sure to omit extraneous articles (such as the) and
descriptive clauses.
• If your site is available in multiple languages, you must submit separate requests
for each version.

Application Process
Once you are certain that your site complies with all the requirements, submit your
application to Google News at https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/
40787#contact=1&ts=3179198.
Be thorough and precise when filling out the application. It can take a couple of weeks
for Google to review an inclusion request. If the application is denied, no reason will
be provided and you cannot reapply for 60 days, so be sure that your submission is as
accurate and complete as possible.

Paywalls and Subscription Sites
Sites that require registration to view articles or have a “paywall,” whereby article
access requires a subscription, are labeled as such in Google News (see Figure 10-17).

OPTIMIZING FOR NEWS SEARCH: GOOGLE NEWS

www.it-ebooks.info

679

Figure 10-17. Google News content behind a paywall

Stories labeled as “subscription” tend to receive fewer clicks than articles that are free.
This consequently reduces the click-through-rate for that publication. Because CTR is
a strong signal in the ranking algorithm, subscription sites will tend to get less visibility
in Google News than sites that are free to users.
As an alternative to labeling a site as a subscription, Google offers a program called
First Click Free, or FCF (http://bit.ly/reg_sub). With FCF, publishers must allow users
referred from Google to bypass the paywall for that particular article. For any additional clicks during that session, the publisher can present the user with the paywall.
FCF requires that visitors from Google be permitted five free clicks each day, regardless
of whether the paywall is hard (no free article views) or metered (views allowed up to a
certain number of articles within a certain timeframe, typically one month). For example, the New York Times limits nonsubscribers to viewing 10 articles per month. It is
important to understand that FCF overrides the publisher’s metered allotment. Once
the user has viewed her monthly allotment of free articles, she must subscribe (or register) to view additional articles. However, sites that implement FCF must still allow
this user to access the first article free if she is referred from Google, and they must
allow this five times each day.

Google News Publisher Center
Google News is different from Google web search in that it is a static environment
when it comes to content discovery. The crawler goes no more than one level deep
from a set of pages that are entered into its database when a publisher is accepted into
Google News. If your site launches a new section page or subsection page, Google
News will not find that page just from crawling a new link in your navigation. You
must notify the Google News publisher help team, and they will manually update their
system to add a new source page to your crawl.
For dynamic, growing publisher sites, this creates a tedious and often uncertain cycle
of requesting frequent changes to your registration, which is a manual process. Google
hates manual processes, hence the new Google News Publisher Center. This is a tool

680

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

designed to facilitate the addition, removal, and “labeling” of new site pages by allowing publishers some control over updating section pages and their labels.

Technical Requirements
Google News has some unique technical content requirements, many of which are
more particular than the web search algorithm. For example:
• The text that makes up an article’s date information and author byline should be
the only text or code between the article’s headline and the article’s first sentence.
It should be placed in a separate line of HTML between the article’s headline and
the article’s body text.
• The URL for each article must contain a unique number consisting of at least three
digits (http://bit.ly/article_urls); however, this rule is waived for URLs submitted via
News sitemaps.
• Articles must contain a minimum of 80 words. This means that short news briefs
or pages with a video and a single brief paragraph are unlikely to be included in
the news index.
• The HTML source page of a section or article must be less than 256 KB in size.
This can be an issue for pages that use infinite scroll or have a substantial number
of user comments.
• Pages that display multiple articles at the same URL will not be included.
• Image links or links embedded in JavaScript cannot be crawled.
• Section and article pages must be on the same domain (or subdomain) as your
main site (exceptions are videos on YouTube.com and RSS feeds on
Feedburner.com).

682

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

• Sites encoded in UTF-8 are optimal, and article pages must have an HTTP contenttype of text/html, text/plain, or application/xhtml+xml.
• If your publication mixes news with other types of content such as advice columns, how-to articles, weather forecasts, stock data, classified ads, or paid advertorials, Google News expects you to prevent this content from getting crawled.
There are three methods you can use to accomplish this:
— Use a page-specific meta tag:
<meta name="Googlebot-News" content="noindex, nofollow">

— Place all of your non-news content in different subdirectories (or subdomains),
such as http://example.com/jobs or http://jobs.example.com and block GooglebotNews access to these sections in the robots.txt file.
— Create a Google News sitemap for your news articles only and inform Google
News (http://bit.ly/report_issue) that you prefer to have your articles crawled
exclusively from there.

Headlines
The technical specifications for headlines are as follows:
• Headlines must contain at least 10 characters and be between 2 and 22 words in
length.
• Do not link article headlines (linked headlines are a default setting in some site
templates).
• Wrap the article headline in an <h1> tag. Ideally this will be the only <h1> tag on
that page.
• The article headline should also be in the <title> tag, placed before any additional
information such as the publisher name or the section.
— Like this:
<title>This is the headline - Lifestyle - Daily Publisher</title>

— But not like this:
<title>Daily Publisher - This is the headline</title>

— And not like this:
<title>Lifestyle: This Is the Headline - Daily Publisher</title>

• If the headline in the <title> tag is significantly different from the headline in the
<h1> tag, this can prevent the story from being included in Google News.

OPTIMIZING FOR NEWS SEARCH: GOOGLE NEWS

683

Meta tags
Google News has certain requirements regarding the use of meta tags as well.

canonical.

If you publish the same article on multiple pages within your site, use
the rel="canonical" link element to specify which URL to rank for a story.

Meta description.

Google News does not use the meta description tag for snippets.
Instead, the crawler looks at article body text near the headline (http://bit.ly/incor
rect_snippets).
There are two meta tags that are specific to Google News and do not apply to web
search: news_keyword and standout.

news_keyword.

This tag is the only on-page keyword tag that is used for ranking by
the major search engines.

The news_keyword tag is placed within the page’s <head> tags. It can be used to specify
keywords that are highly relevant to the article but might not be in the headline or the
first paragraph of the story. For example, an article with the headline “USA vs. Belgium Breaks Another Ratings Record” could use the tag like this:
<meta name="news_keywords" content=" FIFA, soccer, football, World Cup 2014">

Commas are the only punctuation allowed in this field and should be used to separate
each keyword or phrase. You can use up to 10 terms for a given article and all keywords are given equal value, so the first keyword is not considered a stronger signal
than the tenth keyword. Words that are contained in the headline or the first paragraph do not need to be repeated in the news_keywords tag.

standout. When a publisher breaks a news story, it is important to Google News to
attribute that article as the original source, but algorithmically this has been a challenge. In late 2010, Google announced a new meta tag named standout that publishers
can use to designate a particular article as the source of a story or as an exceptional
piece of journalism. Google provides the following criteria to determine when the use
of this tag is appropriate:
• The article is an original source for the story.
• Your organization has invested significant resources in reporting or producing the
article.
• The article deserves special recognition.
• The standout tag has not been used on your own articles more than seven times in
the past calendar week.

684

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

When another publisher breaks a story and your organization writes about it, refers to
it, or otherwise draws from it, Google strongly suggests using this tag in your article to
credit that publisher by citing its URL in your standout tag. If your article draws on
more than one piece of original or exceptional journalism, you can use multiple stand
out tag citations within your article. Citing standout articles from other publishers does
not count against your limit of seven self-citations per week.
The standout tag cannot be added after the article has been published. This tag is
placed in the page <head> and can be coded as a meta tag or as a link tag:
<head>
...
<meta name="standout"
content="http://www.example.com/breaking_exclusive_story_2314"/>
</head>
<head>
...
<link rel="standout"
href="http://www.example.com/breaking_exclusive_story_2314"/>
</head>

When the href URL points to itself, Google interprets the tag as a self-citation. When
the href URL points to another publisher’s page, the tag is considered to be an
out-citation.

Article expiration. This tag is treated as a removal request and is used to specify that
an article should be removed from the Google index at a certain time. To function
properly, the tag must be included in the article at the time that it is first crawled. It
will take about a day after the removal date passes for the page to disappear from the
search results. The date and time must be specified in the RFC 850 format as follows:
<meta name="googlebot" content="unavailable_after: 25-Aug-2011 15:00:00 EST">

Date. This tag can be used in addition to the date and time specified in the article
byline. Use W3C format:
<meta name="DC.date.issued" content="YYYY-MM-DD">

Thumbnail Images in Google News
Google News includes a thumbnail image in almost every cluster displayed in either
web search results or on the Google News home and section pages (see Figure 10-21).
Having your article’s image used as the thumbnail for a cluster can increase the
amount of clicks that story receives.

OPTIMIZING FOR NEWS SEARCH: GOOGLE NEWS

www.it-ebooks.info

685

Figure 10-21. Google News article thumbnail image

Images must be hosted on the publisher’s domain—not an external domain or content
delivery network (CDN)—and must use a standard filename extension like .jpg.
Use the following guidelines to increase the likelihood of getting your article images
included:
• Place images near the article headline.
• Place images inline within the article content.
• Use well-written captions.
• Use images that are fairly large in size (at least 60 pixels by 60 pixels).
You can find additional image information for Google News at http://bit.ly/miss
ing_images.

Recrawling
Google News does recrawl articles, but most recrawls occur only within the first few
hours after discovery. Google’s system is generally better at detecting and displaying
bigger updates, such as a substantial change to a headline or the lead paragraph. If an
article is edited after being indexed in Google News, there is no guarantee that the
article will get recrawled and updated.

Google News Sitemaps
Google News uses the standard Sitemaps protocol, but with additional news-specific
tags such as related keywords, article images, content genres, and relevant stock tickers. Even though a standard sitemap file can include multiple types of content, it is
better to create a separate News sitemap for your news content. A News sitemap
allows your content to be discovered more efficiently and comprehensively because

686

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

you can feed all of your news articles to Google News even if they are not linked from
a section page in the News database. If your site contains a mix of news and non-news
content, you can use the sitemap to exert more granular control over which content is
submitted. The News sitemap will accept URLs that do not include the three numbers
required for discovery from crawling.
A News sitemap is particularly recommended for:
• Sites that have been recently added to Google News
• Sites that often add new section pages or change existing section URLs
• Sites that require users to follow several links to reach news articles
NOTE
The Google Sitemap Generator cannot be used to create a News sitemap. There
are a number of third-party tools recommended by Google that can help you to
generate a Google News sitemap (http://bit.ly/sitemap_generators).

News sitemap guidelines
Here are the guidelines for creating a News sitemap:
• Upload the sitemap to your root directory.
• Update the sitemap immediately after publishing a new article.
• Do not include articles older than 48 hours.
• For the publication date, refer to the W3C format, using either the “complete
date” format (YYYY-MM-DD) or the “complete date plus hours, minutes, and seconds” format with time zone designator (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD) format. Use the
original date and time at which the article was published on your site, not the
time the article was added to your sitemap.
• A News sitemap with more than 1,000 URLs must be broken into multiple sitemaps with a sitemap index file.

News sitemap fields
The following subsections describe the guidelines and requirements for the News sitemap fields.

Publication name.

Make sure that your publication name in the sitemap exactly
matches the name you used when you submitted your application for Google News. If
your publication name is Daily Herald, but you submitted it as Gotham Daily Herald

OPTIMIZING FOR NEWS SEARCH: GOOGLE NEWS

www.it-ebooks.info

687

because Google News already contained a publication named Daily Herald, your sitemap publication name must also use Gotham Daily Herald.

Access (paywalls and registrations).

The <access> tag takes one of the following

values:

Subscription
An article that requires users to pay to view content
Registration
An article that requires users to sign up for an unpaid account to view content
For publishers that include a mix of free and paid articles, the only way to designate
this on an article-by-article basis is by using the <access> tag within a News sitemap
feed.

Genres (content types).

Values for the <genres> tag are required when applicable
and restricted to the following five options. The tag can contain more than one value,
separated by commas:

Satire
An article that ridicules its subject for didactic purposes
OpEd
An opinion-based article that comes specifically from the Op-Ed section of your
site
Opinion
Any other opinion-based article not appearing on an Op-Ed page
PressRelease
An official press release
Blog
Any article published on a blog, or in a blog format

Keywords.

The keywords field contains a comma-separated list of keywords describing the topic of the article. Keywords may be drawn from, but are not limited to, the
list of existing Google News keywords.

Images. The most effective way to get your images indexed is to include them in
your News sitemap feed. Here is an example of a sitemap entry for a story with an
associated image:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
xmlns:news="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-news/0.9">

Stock tickers.

For business articles, you can include a comma-separated list of up to
five stock tickers of companies that are the main subject of the article. Each ticker
must be prefixed by the name of its stock exchange, and must match its entry in Google Finance (http://bit.ly/missing_images).

Google News sitemap validation
The following XML schemas define the elements and attributes that can appear in a
News sitemap file. A News sitemap can contain both News-specific elements and core

• For News-specific elements, schemas can be downloaded from http://bit.ly/newsspecific_schemas.
• For core Sitemaps elements, schemas can be downloaded from http://www.site

Google News sitemap submission
There are a couple of different ways to submit a sitemap to Google News.

Via robots.txt.

You can add the location of your News sitemap file to the robots.txt

file.
Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap_location.xml

This directive is independent of the user-agent line, so it does not matter where you
place it in your file. If you have a sitemap index file, you only need to include the
location of the index file rather than each individual sitemap.

690

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

Via Google Search Console.

Even if you specify the location in the robots.txt file,
you should also upload the sitemap through your Search Console account. Doing this
will provide you with access to detailed information should your sitemap contain
errors.
Here’s how to submit a sitemap in Search Console:
1. Log in to Google Search Console or set up an account if you don’t have one.
2. On the Search Console home page, click the site for which you want to manage
sitemaps.
3. On the lefthand menu, click Crawl to expand the Crawl menu, and then click
Sitemaps from the Crawl menu list.
4. Click the Add/Test Sitemap button in the top-right corner of your screen.
5. In the text box that pops up, add the complete URL path to your sitemap or the
sitemap index file.
6. Click Submit.
7. Refresh your browser to see your new sitemap in the sitemaps list.
Here’s how to test a sitemap:
1. Log in to Google Search Console or set up an account if you don’t have one.
2. On the Search Console home page, click the site for which you want to manage
sitemaps.
3. On the lefthand menu, click Crawl to expand the Crawl menu, and then click
Sitemaps from the Crawl menu list.
4. Click on a sitemap in the list to open the Sitemaps Details page and click Test Sitemap in the top-right corner. Alternatively, if you don’t see the sitemap you’re
looking for, click Add/Test Sitemap on the main Sitemaps page, enter in a URL
path in the text box of the dialog that appears, and click Test.
5. Once the test is completed, click Open Test Results to see your test results.
6. Once you correct any issues identified by the test, you can click Resubmit to alert
Google of any changes.
And finally, here’s how to view the Sitemap Details page:
1. Log in to Google Search Console or set up an account if you don’t have one.
2. On the Search Console home page, click the site for which you want to manage
sitemaps.

3. On the lefthand menu, click Crawl to expand the Crawl menu, and then click
Sitemaps from the Crawl menu list.
4. In the list of sitemaps, click the sitemap you want to examine to open the Sitemaps Details page. From this page, you can view errors, indexing statistics, and
more.

News crawl errors
Publishers in Google News can view news-specific crawl error reports (http://bit.ly/
news_crawl_errors) in their Google Search Console account:
1. From the Dashboard, click Crawl > Crawl Errors.
2. Click on the News tab to see crawl errors specific to your news content.
3. Crawl errors are organized into categories, such as “Article extraction” or “Title
error.” Clicking on one of these categories will display a list of affected URLs and
the crawl errors they’re generating.

Videos in Google News
Only videos from publishers accepted in Google News will be included. Videos can be
embedded in an article with the YouTube player, or publishers can create a YouTube
channel and share it with Google News. To be included in Google News, YouTube
channels and embedded videos must adhere to the following guidelines:
• Videos should be timely, reporting on current news events. No how-to videos,
promotions, movie trailers, or music videos are allowed.
• Videos should be uploaded as quickly as possible. This will help them to be grouped with the most recent articles.
• Videos containing a single story rather than multiple segments are preferred.
• Video titles should be descriptive and specific (not generic like “Breaking News”).
• The video description field should contain a lot of detail. Convey the who, what,
when, where, and why of the story.
• The video keyword tags field is very helpful. Include the names of the people,
places, companies, and events mentioned in the video.
• Each video must be assigned to a category when it is uploaded. For general news
coverage, select the YouTube category “News & Politics” (which is
youtube_category_id 25).
• Audio must be clear and easy-to-understand. Images should be in focus.

692

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

• All content must be original and unique. Music, images, and text within videos
must belong to your organization or be used with legal permission.
• Videos must be embeddable on other sites to be displayed in Google News.
• Video that are geoblocked in certain regions will not appear in Google News.
Additional YouTube channel guidelines are as follows:
• Only YouTube channels from publishers already in Google News will be included.
• Regularly updated channels are more likely to be accepted.
• A YouTube channel can be customized to reflect your organization’s branding. In
the channel profile section, include information about your organization and links
to your site.
• If you have multiple channels, clearly identify each category (politics, business,
entertainment, sports, etc.).
Once the YouTube channel is ready, inform Google by using its “Adding a New Section” form:
1. Add the URL of your YouTube channel in the field under “New section URLs.”
2. In the pull-down menu for Category, select “YouTube channel,” which is near the
end of the list.
3. Make sure you also include your publication name and URL at the start of the
form.
You can find additional information about videos in Google News at these sites:

Editor’s Picks
The Editor’s Picks feature allows publishers to showcase original, innovative news content with their publication logo. Editor’s Picks are displayed in a sidebar module in the
right column on the Google News home page and certain section pages. Editor’s Picks
can include content that Google News might not index otherwise, such as long-form
narrative articles, slideshows, interactive graphics, or video stories. Publishers can provide up to five links that represent the organization’s best original journalistic work at
any given moment.

Publishers can participate in Editor’s Picks by creating and submitting a custom RSS or
Atom feed. Up to three different feeds can be submitted—one for the home page, and
one each for the Technology and Business sections.
The following are a handful of important guidelines about submitting and maintaining
this feed:
• Include only news content (no links to subscription offers, how-to articles, stock
quotes, classified ads, weather forecasts, etc.).
• Individual items in the feed can be older than 48 hours, as long as at least one
item in the feed has been recently updated. Ideally, the feed should be updated
once or twice per day. At least one additional item must be added to the feed
every 48 hours. Feeds not updated at all within 48 hours will not be shown to
users.
• Only feeds containing at least three articles are displayed. If there are more than
five articles, only the top five articles will be shown.
• It is recommended to include an author name for each article. Without this information, the byline will be presented as “<Publisher> Staff.”
• Headlines longer than 75 characters get truncated.
Once your feed is ready, submit it at https://support.google.com/news/publisher/contact/

Optimizing for Video/Multimedia Search
Video search offers a tremendous opportunity for organic search traffic via your video
content. The first component of video search optimization involves improving the
ranking of your video content in Google’s “universal” search results. The second
involves improving the ranking of your videos in YouTube (the second largest search
engine).
According to data from comScore qSearch for May 2014, in the United States, Google
had 12.5 billion explicit core searches that month, YouTube had 4.0 billion search
queries, Microsoft had 3.5 billion searches, and Yahoo! had 1.8 billion. So, even if most
SEOs know YouTube is the second largest search, they still focus on Google.

694

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

An analysis of Google Universal Search results by Searchmetrics (June 18, 2014)
found that videos appear in 65% of Google searches in the United States. However,
54% of these video results were from YouTube, about 5% were from Vimeo, about 5%
were from Dailymotion, and no other video provider got more than about 1%. In
addition, the average first video integration from YouTube was about two positions
ahead of the average first position of a competitor’s video.
So, although it may seem counterintuitive, your best strategy for improving the ranking of your video content in Google Universal Search results often involves improving
the ranking of your videos in YouTube first.

Video SEO for YouTube
Today, more than 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. That
means 144,000 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every day. So you’ve got to
optimize your videos, playlists, and channel to give them the best potential for success
on the platform.
Although YouTube’s algorithm doesn’t change over 500 times a year like Google’s
algorithm does, the tips outlined here should come with the advisory best if used before
the next algorithm update. For example, YouTube officially replaced “view count” with
“watch time” as a ranking factor in October 2012. This adjusted the ranking of videos
in YouTube search to reward engaging videos that keep viewers watching and benefit
channels if their videos drive more viewing time across YouTube.
On the other hand, “relevance” has remained a ranking factor since the early days—
that is, before Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in October 2006. So, recognizing that some things will change while others will remain the same, here are key
strategies, best practices, and important tips for video SEO (freshness date: July 2014).

Conduct keyword research
When conducting keyword research for video SEO, one of the first tools that you
should consider using is Google Trends. Google Trends enables you to take popular
search queries and explore traffic patterns over time and geography. In March 2013,
Google Trends added YouTube search data going back to 2008, making it a great tool to
look at video trends. Just visit Google Trends and enter up to five terms or phrases in
the search box, and the default setting will display web search interest. Then, on the
upper right, click on “Web Search” and choose “YouTube Search” for YouTube search
interest. You can slice by region, time, or category as well. You will quickly see—and
be able to show others—the similarities and/or differences in Google and YouTube
search trends. For example, web search interest in “Chevy” and “Chevrolet” was the
same in June 2014. But, if you compared the YouTube search interest for these two

OPTIMIZING FOR VIDEO/MULTIMEDIA SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

695

terms, you would see that “Chevy” was almost twice as popular as “Chevrolet” that
month.
Another trending tool to check out is YouTube Trends, which shows you the latest
trending videos and topics on YouTube.

Optimize your metadata
YouTube uses metadata—your video’s title, tags, and description—to index your video
correctly. To maximize your presence in search, suggested videos, and promotion,
make sure your metadata is well optimized. Your title can be up to 100 characters
long. Your description can include up to 5,000 characters. Your tags can be up to 120
characters. Use every one of these limits for each of your videos.

Title. Make your title compelling—this is your video’s headline. If it showed up in a
search, would you click on it? Other guidelines include:
• Always represent your content accurately.
• Offer keywords first, branding at the end.
• For serial content, add the episode number to the end of the title.
• Update video titles so they continue to grab views.
NOTE
Avoid titles that trick viewers into clicking on the video. This will cause drop-offs
in the first few seconds of your video and will negatively impact your video’s
watch time.

Description.

Only the first few sentences of your description will appear in search
results or above the fold on a watch page, so make them count! Follow a template for
all of your video descriptions to create consistency.

A video description should:
• Accurately describe your video’s actual content (transcript excerpts are ideal) in
one or two sentences.
• Describe your channel and link to your channel page.
• Drive viewers to subscribe (so include a subscribe link).
• Link to other episodes or related videos and playlists.

696

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

NOTE
While you may want to link offsite in your videos, keep in mind that this could
affect your video’s watch time. Videos with lower watch times appear lower in
search results. YouTube’s new “metadata defaults” feature allows you to create
templates for your metadata and ensure important text or links are always
included when you upload a video.

A video description may:
• Include your channel’s release schedule.
• Include links to time-codes in the video for long-form content.
• Include a recurring keyword tagline. The keyword tagline is a group of sentences
that describe your channel. They should include several search-driven keywords.
Repeating this tagline in episode descriptions will inform first-time viewers about
your channel.
NOTE
Remember that it is a violation of YouTube’s Terms of Service to use misleading
metadata on your videos.

Tags.

Tags are descriptive keywords that will help people find your videos. Create a
set of standard tags for your channel that can be applied to any video you publish
(e.g., filmmaking, animation, comedy, “Funny Videos,” “Pet Videos,” etc.):
• Include a mix of both general and specific tags.
• Use enough tags to thoroughly and accurately describe the video.
• Update catalogue videos’ tags when new search trends emerge.
• Properly format tags to ensure appropriate indexing of your video.
• Include keywords from your title in your video’s tags.
• List tags in order of relevance to the video and try to use the whole 120-character
limit.
NOTE
Update the metadata on your older videos if their titles, tags, or descriptions are
not optimized. This can increase views even if a video’s been public for a long
time.

Create custom thumbnails
Thumbnails show up in different sizes and formats all across the platform and beyond.
Make sure you’ve got a strong, vibrant image that pops no matter what size it is.
General guidelines:
• When shooting a video, take shots that will make great thumbnails.
• Always upload custom thumbnails with the video file.
• Make sure the thumbnail is not racy.
• Consider the legibility of your thumbnail at multiple sizes. Thumbnails change size
depending on the YouTube placement and device.
Visual guidelines:
• Use visual cues (colors, images, shapes, personalities) that are consistent with your
brand.
• Thumbnails should be clear, in focus, and high-resolution (640px × 360px minimum, 16:9 aspect ratio).
• Use bright, high-contrast images.
• Include close-ups of faces.
• Use visually compelling imagery.
• Make sure your thumbnail is well framed with good composition.
• Ensure the foreground stands out from background.
• Check that the thumbnail looks great at both small and large sizes.
• Be sure the image accurately represents the content.
NOTE
Upload high-resolution thumbnails so they appear crisp and clear wherever viewers happen to see them.

Optimize your annotations
Annotations are clickable overlays that you can add to your YouTube videos. You can
use annotations in a huge variety of ways; brands and partners are always thinking of
new and innovative uses.
Annotations are a great way to encourage your viewers to engage with your video and
take meaningful actions as a result. The key is to create an annotations experience that
is conversational and interactive.

698

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

Use annotation in these cases:
• Subscribe direct link. Annotate the “subscription confirmation” page to make it
easy for viewers to subscribe to your channel.
• Navigation. Highlight your newest video, create a table of contents for long videos,
or prompt users to enter a sequential playlist viewing experience (e.g., “Click here
for the next video in this series”).
• Calls to action. Drive engagement by inviting viewers to like, comment, or
respond to questions. Complement scripted calls to action in the video with textual annotations.
Annotation best practices:
• Avoid annotations along the very top of the frame. This is where your title will
show if it’s embedded.
• Don’t obstruct the actual content.
• Don’t bombard the viewer. This can feel “spammy.”
• When appropriate, set annotations to open a new window when clicked. Be careful! Don’t take viewers away from a video too soon.
• Annotations at the end of a video should open in the same window.
NOTE
Measure the effects of your annotations in YouTube Analytics with the “Annotations” report.

Spotlight annotations.

Most annotation types are self-explanatory. Spotlight annotations stand out because they allow creators to subtly create clickable areas within a
video. The text appears only when a viewer mouses over it; a light outline shows
otherwise. This is a great way to include unobtrusive but clickable annotations.

InVideo Programming annotations.

Unlike regular annotations, InVideo Programming allows you to promote both your channel and any one of your videos on YouTube across all of your uploads. Here’s how InVideo Programming works:
• When promoting videos, it pulls in the thumbnail as the annotation. Videos with
optimized thumbnails perform better.
• It allows you to upload a custom, transparent, square image to promote your
channel. Unsubscribed viewers who mouse over the channel image can subscribe
to your channel without interrupting the video.

OPTIMIZING FOR VIDEO/MULTIMEDIA SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

699

• InVideo Programming annotations are viewable on mobile devices.

Optimize your captions
Providing captions makes your video content accessible to a wider audience. It also
acts as additional metadata, which helps your video show up in more places on the
site. If your video is captioned for multiple languages, it will also be searchable in
those languages.

Create and optimize playlists
Creating playlists allows you to collect, organize, and publish multiple videos together.
This increases watch time, encourages user engagement with your channel, and creates another asset that will appear in search results and in Suggested Videos. You can
create playlists using your own videos, other videos, or a combination of both.
Use playlists as follows:
• Group a set of videos that you want viewers to enjoy in a single session or in a
particular order.
• Organize videos around a theme or a tent-pole event.
• Separate multiple shows into playlists and feature them on your channel.
• Combine your most-viewed videos with new uploads.
• Curate good brand-advocating videos (reviews, testimonials, hygiene, etc.) created
by your community.
Playlist best practices:
• Choose a strong thumbnail for your playlist. Make it pop!
• If a playlist needs context, upload a short, snappy intro video or interstitial videos
with a host. Create a hosted playlist.
• Make your metadata work for you. A strong title, tags, and description will help
people find your playlist.
• Use Playlist Notes to write conversational asides about individual videos.
• Use in-video messaging, annotations, end cards, and links to send viewers to a
playlist.
• Feature your playlist on your channel page by creating a new “section.”

NOTE
To link to a video in Autoplay playlist mode, click the Share button and then copy
and paste that URL. The video link will launch the whole playlist.

Optimize your channel
Your channel is the face of your brand on YouTube. It allows you to collect and organize all your videos in one place. Several customizable channel features will help
ensure that you’re delivering the best experience for your viewers while making your
brand more discoverable across YouTube.
A number of channel features will follow your videos across the YouTube site and on
devices—make sure that they effectively represent your brand personality:

Channel name
Pick a short, memorable channel name in line with your brand identity. This will
appear widely across YouTube, so make sure it’s the best representation of your
brand.

Channel icon
Upload a square, high-resolution image to be your channel’s icon across YouTube.
The image will appear alongside all your videos on the watch page. (In most cases,
you can use your brand’s logo.)

Channel description
• The first few words of your channel description appear most frequently across
the site, so highlight your most important branding up front.
• Include your upload schedule, especially if you host multiple content types or
series.

Channel art
• Channel art is your channel’s primary branding across all devices. Create customized, visually compelling channel art. Busy images don’t scale well, so
keep the image simple.
• Add website and social media links to the About tab. Include these links in
your channel art to help tie your YouTube presence to the rest of your online
brand.
• Check how your channel looks in search, related channels, and the channel
browse page. Do your channel icon, channel name, and channel art do a good
job representing your brand to potential fans?

OPTIMIZING FOR VIDEO/MULTIMEDIA SEARCH

www.it-ebooks.info

701

NOTE
Associate your official website with your YouTube channel.

Optimizing for subscribed fans.

In the Browse view of the channel page, subscribed and unsubscribed viewers see different versions of your channel.

What to watch next
• Subscribed viewers see personalized recommendations of “What to Watch
Next” based on their viewing history.
• Promote a video with InVideo Programming to make it appear first in the
“What to Watch Next” recommendations.

Recent activity
• Your most recent feed posts will appear on your channel page in the recent
activity feed and on the activity tab.
• Keep your feed active with uploads, likes, and channel posts. This will give
your fans another reason to come back regularly.
NOTE
Your top section will show up most frequently across devices. Make sure it will
draw in new viewers.

Optimizing for unsubscribed viewers. The unsubscribed view is your first opportunity to convince potential fans to subscribe.
Channel trailer
• Enable the channel trailer for unsubscribed viewers. This video will autoplay,
so tell new visitors what your channel’s all about and why they should subscribe.
• Keep your trailer short, but make sure you ask the fans to subscribe!
• Show, don’t tell. Give potential fans a taste of your best content.

Sections
• Sections organize videos, playlists, and channels on your channel’s Browse
page. Subscribed and unsubscribed viewers will see them.
• Sections can divide your content by genre, theme, show, or any other criteria.
Effective organization will help your audience find the content most relevant
to them.

702

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

Gain subscribers by promoting your channel
Once you’ve optimized your channel for new viewers, it’s time to use YouTube tools to
bring them there.

InVideo Programming – Channel Promotion
• Enable Channel Promotion in InVideo Programming to place your channel
icon across your entire video library.

Annotations and calls to action
• Use end cards or other clickable annotations to push viewers to your channel
page.
• Vocal calls to action along with annotations or video description links can
help increase click-through rates.

Linking with Google+
• Link your YouTube channel to your Google+ page to amplify the social reach
of your videos, increase discoverability of your content, and offer a more
streamlined Google experience. Doing this also enables new features for easier
management of your YouTube channel.

Related Channels
• Related Channels are promoted channels populated by YouTube that appear
on your channel page. Recommendations are based on channels that are similar to yours.
• Be sure to enable Related Channels. Disabling the feature will prevent your
channel from being promoted on other channels.

Featured Channels
• Featured Channels are channels you choose to promote on your channel
page. For instance, highlight other channels in your brand’s portfolio.
• If you are promoting a large number of channels, rotate through the list using
the “shuffle” feature. This ensures all your channels get visibility.
NOTE
Make sure your icon doesn’t distract from the videos or overlap with existing
annotations.

Optimize watch time
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, watch time is an important metric for video SEO
on YouTube. The algorithm for suggesting videos prioritizes those that lead to a longer
overall viewing session over those that receive more clicks. Viewers benefit from more
enjoyable content being suggested to them, and creators benefit from more focused,
engaged audiences.
If you’re making videos that people are watching well beyond the first click, those videos will be suggested more often. Here are some guidelines:
• Be an effective editor. Create a compelling opening to your videos and then use
programming, branding, and packaging techniques to maintain and build interest
throughout the video.
• Build your subscriber base. Subscribers are your most loyal fans and will be notified of new videos and playlists to watch.
• Involve your audience in your videos, encourage comments, and interact with
your viewers.
• Build long watch-time sessions for your content by organizing and featuring content on your channel.
• Create a regular release schedule for your videos when uploading to encourage
viewers to watch sets of videos over single videos.

Check YouTube Analytics
Measurement is key, both for defining success and optimizing toward it. YouTube Analytics enables you to track a number of your most important metrics. For example, the
Traffic Sources Report shows you which search terms people are using to find your
video. The Views Report identifies which videos have the greatest view times and
view-through rates. And the Audience Retention Report indicates which videos are
successful at keeping viewers watching.
The key is to decide what success looks like and then translate that into metrics that
are relevant for your brand. Most brands find it useful to select one metric for each of
the three buckets that measure engagement with your content:

Audience
Are you reaching the right audience? How well?

Expression
Is your target audience engaging with your content? How much?

704

CHAPTER TEN: MOBILE, LOCAL, AND VERTICAL SEO

www.it-ebooks.info

Participation
Is your audience endorsing and sharing your content? How much?
NOTE
The YouTube Analytics API can be configured to schedule regular reports on
specific metrics.

Leverage paid advertising
While this book is focused on SEO, video SEO can leverage paid advertising in a way
that website SEO can’t. In fact, YouTube enables you to ignite earned media with paid
media.
Given the abundance of videos on the Web, it’s risky to assume that your content will
be organically discovered by a large audience. That is why it’s vital to design a solid
plan to promote your content and ensure it’s viewed by your target audience.
“Going viral” plays a key role in building your audience on YouTube, but unless you
already have millions of subscribers, you’ll need to seed your content when it
launches. Indeed, when they don’t have an existing subscriber base or engaged social
following, many brands use paid advertising on YouTube to ignite sharing and accelerate audience building.
The YouTube platform allows you to optimize your investment in paid media by activating the virtuous circle that links owned media (your video content), paid media (paid
video advertising), and earned media (“free” views obtained when people share the
video ads).
This provides you with a major benefit from advertising on YouTube that you don’t get
from Google: earned impact. According to YouTube, more than 6,000 campaigns generated at least one earned view as a result of every two paid views in the first half of
2014.
And the YouTube audience isn’t shy about sharing brand content: two-thirds of YouTube users agree that “if there is a brand I love, I tend to tell everyone about it.” Across
the globe, they are twice as likely to be early adopters, agreeing that “I am among the
first of my friends and colleagues to try new products.” They are 1.8 times more likely
to be influencers, agreeing that “people often come to me for advice before making a
purchase.”
Indeed, hundreds of campaigns get more than two earned views per paid view.
Although you don’t get that benefit with Google AdWords, you can get that benefit
with Google AdWords for video, which powers YouTube TrueView video ads.

Video SEO for Google
Once upon a time, one of the best ways to improve your site’s appearance in video
search results was to make sure that Google knew about all of your rich video content.
So it made sense to submit a sitemap to Google that included video information in a
supported format, making the included video URLs searchable on Google Video.
Google Video was launched on January 25, 2005, after which Google bought former
competitor YouTube on October 9, 2006. On June 13, 2007, Google announced that
Google Video search results would begin to include videos discovered by its web crawlers on YouTube, on other hosting services, and from user uploads. On January 14,
2009, the Official Google Video Blog announced, “In a few months, we will discontinue support for uploads to Google Video.” On April 15, 2011, Google announced via
email that after April 29 it would no longer allow playback of content hosted on Google Video. However, it reversed that decision one week later to provide users with
greater support for migration to YouTube. The service, which was renamed Google
Videos, was shut down on August 20, 2012.
The remaining Google Videos content was automatically moved to YouTube, so for all
intents and purposes, Google Video has been replaced by YouTube.

Embed YouTube videos and playlists
Today, one of the best ways to improve the ranking of your video content in Google
Universal Search results is to upload it to YouTube—though there is still debate in the
industry as to whether uploading your video to your own site first, for origination
credit, provides longer-term site benefits.
Whichever approach you decide upon, these are instructions for uploading to YouTube:
Embed a video:
1. Click the Share link under the video.
2. Click the Embed link.
3. Copy the code provided in the expanded box.
4. Paste the code into your blog or website.
Embed a playlist:

Use a video distribution service
Searchmetrics’ analysis of Google Universal Search results, cited earlier in this chapter,
indicates there’s another way to improve the ranking of your video content in Google
Universal Search results: upload it to Vimeo or Dailymotion. Uploading your video
content to YouTube makes it 10 to 11 times more likely that it will appear in Google
Universal Search results—about two positions ahead of the average first position of a
video from Vimeo or Dailymotion. However, it makes much more sense if you upload
your video content to YouTube as well as Vimeo, Dailymotion, and other top video
and social networking sites. To do this efficiently and effectively, consider using a video
distribution service, such as OneLoad. OneLoad is powered by its parent company,
TubeMogul, a media buying platform for video advertising founded in 2006. You can
leverage its Destination feature to easily distribute to custom sites as well as encode
and create RSS feeds to syndicate your video anywhere. And videos distributed
through OneLoad are tracked by TubeMogul’s powerful analytics. OneLoad is the
video distribution tool of choice for some of the world’s largest brands, agencies, media
companies, government institutions, and nonprofits. These organizations use this specialized service to get their videos watched by more people in more places.

Use a Google video sitemap
One of the last video SEO strategies to consider using is a Google video sitemap. Creating a video sitemap is a way to make sure that Google knows about all the video content on your site, especially content that it might not otherwise discover via its usual
crawling mechanisms.
However, as the analysis by Searchmetrics indicates, about 1% of the videos in Google
Universal Search results come from websites like MUZU TV, Howcast, Artistdirect, and
eHow. In other words, creating a video sitemap may let Google know about your rich
video content, but your videos still need to get a significant number of views or watch
time to appear in Google Universal Search results.
When a user finds your video through Google, she will be linked to your hosted environments for the full playback. Search results will contain a thumbnail image (provided by you or autogenerated by Google) of your video content, as well as information (such as title) contained in your sitemap. It’s also worth noting that Google can’t
(or won’t) predict or guarantee when or if your videos will be added to its index.

OPTIMIZING FOR VIDEO/MULTIMEDIA SEARCH

You can create a separate sitemap listing your video content, or you can add information about your video content to an existing sitemap—whichever is more convenient
for you.
The Google video extension of the Sitemaps protocol enables you to give Google
descriptive information—such as a video’s title, description, duration, and so on—that
makes it easier for users to find a particular piece of content. Google may use text
available on your video’s page rather than the text you supply in the sitemap’s video
content, if this differs.

Adding video information to a sitemap.

You can create a video sitemap based on
the Sitemaps protocol. You can also use an existing mRSS feed as a sitemap. Or, if
you’re the belt-and-suspenders type, you can use both.
Your sitemap will need to include the following minimum information for each video:
title, description, playpage URL, thumbnail URL, and the raw video URL or URL to
Flash video player. Without these five pieces of information, Google cannot surface
your videos in its search results.
Once you’ve created your sitemap, you can submit it using Search Console.

Use recognized file types
Google can crawl Flash SWF objects and the following raw video file
types: .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .mov, .wmv, .asf, .avi, .ra, .ram, .rm, and .flv. All files must be
accessible via HTTP. Metafiles that require a download of the source via streaming protocols are not supported at this time.

Conclusion
As we’ve outlined in this chapter, optimizing your site for mobile search and your vertical content for Universal Search, engaging in local SEO efforts, and if you’re a news
publisher, participating in Google News can provide significant exposure within
organic search for your business. Not only can you gain visibility in the increasingly
diverse search ecosystems, but you can also increase the likelihood that your content
assets are working for you in all areas of the Web to promote increased user sharing
and engagement—which provides a positive feedback loop for all of your SEO efforts.
