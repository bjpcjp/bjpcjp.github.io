<p>One of my major career regrets is having to implement management decisions with a tight smile and clenched teeth.
It's never been my nature to be an asshole - and my Appalachian upbringing didn't exactly provide a bundle of self-confidence.
So my #1 priority over the years was to ensure that my family had a roof and 3 squares a day. That meant keeping a paycheck coming
in to cover the mortgage.</p>

<p>I'm at a point where I can review my various employers and recognize mediocrity when I see it. The most common characteristic of
	each was a lack of interest in ideas - and dissent - bubbling up from the front lines.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate to be picked for a leadership position, I beg of you: *PLEASE* obligate your team to debate, disagree and to
feel comfortable doing so. Best-in-class performance comes from having a diversity of opinions.</p>
