		<p>A lot has been written about how Jeff Bezos and his executives run their meetings, especially that their senior team has banned PowerPoint, and that each meeting starts with a six-page narrative memo which the executives read and absorb for up to 30 minutes before the conversation starts. Sounds pretty good to me. But if you want to move to a Jeff Bezosâ€“style executive meeting without PowerPoint and driven by a six-page narrative memo, you should be aware that most reports are glossing over the one element that could determine the success of the initiative: <strong>the narrative.</strong></p>
