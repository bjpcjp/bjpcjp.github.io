		<p>"After many years of being a very vocal advocate for the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) technique, in the majority of companies I meet, I have stopped recommending the practice. Thatâ€™s because, in so many companies, even though conceptually the technique is simple and sound, it ends up proving a waste of time and effort, and yields little if any results." (Marty Cagan)</p>
