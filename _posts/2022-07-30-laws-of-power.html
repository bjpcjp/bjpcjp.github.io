    <div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Never Outshine the Master</strong></div>
      <div class="card-section">
      <p>Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. 
      Do not go too far in displaying your talents - you may inspire fear and insecurity. 
      Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are.
    </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Learn how to use Enemies</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
    <p>Friends will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. 
      They also become spoiled and tyrannical. 
      Hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal - he has more to prove. 
      You have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.
    </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Conceal your Intentions</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
    <p>Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. 
      If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. 
      Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Always Say Less than Necessary</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
    <p>When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear. 
      Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.
    </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Guard your Reputation with your Life</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once you slip, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Court Attention at all Cost</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit</strong></div>
    <div class="card-section">
    <p>Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Make other People come to you – use Bait if Necessary</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, 
    abandoning his own plans in the process.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Win through your Actions - Never through Argument</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>Any momentary triumph you think gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory. 
    The resentment you create is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. 
    It is better to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. 
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Infection - Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as disease. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Learn to Keep People Dependent on You</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same purpose.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still - Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Crush your Enemy Totally</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation. The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>Too much circulation makes the price go down. 
  The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. 
  If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. 
  You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">
<p>Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. 
  Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables - Be deliberately unpredictable. 
  Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. 
  Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere – everyone has to protect themselves. 
    A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from.
    It cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. 
    Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Know Who You’re Dealing with – Do Not Offend the Wrong Person</strong></div>
    <div class="card-section">
  <p>There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. 
    Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. 
    They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then – never offend or deceive the wrong person.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Do Not Commit to Anyone</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>A fool always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. 
    By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others – playing people against one another, making them pursue you.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Seem Dumber than your Mark</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons. 
    The trick is to make your victims feel smart - not just smart, but smarter than you are. 
    Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Surrendering - Transform Weakness into Power</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. 
    Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. 
    Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you. 
    By turning the other check you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Concentrate Your Forces</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. 
    You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another.
    When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Play the Perfect Courtier</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. 
    He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. 
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Re-Create Yourself</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. 
    Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. 
    Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Keep Your Hands Clean</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency. 
    Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. 
    Maintain a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats to disguise your involvement.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cult-like Following</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. 
    Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. 
    Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. 
    Give your disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. 
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Enter Action with Boldness</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. 
    Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Better to enter with boldness. 
    Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. 
    Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Plan All the Way to the End</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The ending is everything. 
    Account for all possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might give the glory to others. 
    By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
    <strong>Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. 
    All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. 
    When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. 
    Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work – it only raises questions. 
    Teach no one your tricks.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Control the Options - Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice.
    Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. 
    Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. 
    Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. 
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Play to People’s Fantasies</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. 
    Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment. 
    People who can manufacture romance or fantasy are like oases in the desert. Everyone flocks to them. 
    There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Everyone has a weakness. 
    That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. 
    Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Act like a King to be treated like one</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
    <p>The way you carry yourself will determine how you are treated.
      In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. 
      A king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. 
</p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Master the Art of Timing</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Hurrying indicates a lack of control over yourself, and over time. 
    Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. 
    Become a detective of the right moment. 
    Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Disdain Things you cannot have</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. 
    It is sometimes best to leave things alone. 
    If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. 
    The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Create Compelling Spectacles</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power. 
    Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Think as you like - but Behave like others</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>If you make a show of going against the times, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. 
    They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. 
    It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. 
    Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Stir up Waters to Catch Fish</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. Stay calm and objective. 
    But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. 
    Put your enemies off-balance - Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Despise the Free Lunch</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. 
    What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. 
    It is also often wise to pay the full price. 
    Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Avoid Stepping into a Great Man’s Shoes</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>
    What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. 
    If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. 
    Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making.
    Establish your own name and identity by changing course. 
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Strike the Shepherd - the Sheep will Scatter</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of goodwill. 
    If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. 
    Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them. 
    Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. 
    Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Hearts and Minds</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. 
    You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. 
    The way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. 
    Soften up the resistant by playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. 
    Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception.
    When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. 
    The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact. 
    By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. 
    Few can resist the power of Mirror Effect.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform too much at Once</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>
    Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but people are creatures of habit. 
    If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. 
    If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Never appear too Perfect</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>
    Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. 
    Envy creates silent enemies. 
    It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. 
    </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Learn when to Stop</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>
    In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for.
    By going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. 
    There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.
  </p></div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider">
  <strong>Assume Formlessness</strong></div>
  <div class="card-section">
  <p>
    By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. 
    Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. 
    The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order.
  </p></div></div>

</div>
