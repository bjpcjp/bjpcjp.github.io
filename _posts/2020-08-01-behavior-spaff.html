		<p>If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink", you know how human behaviors are often instinctive - to the point that you can't control your "tell" (to use a poker term).</p>

		<p>Gladwell describes an ongoing study (Coan & Gottman) that breaks down human reactions into emotional states. It's not an easy technique to master - but Gottman can predict, with uncanny accuracy, whether a couple will be divorced with 5 years after listening to a few snips of conversation.</p>

		<p>A descripition of SPAFF (Specific Affect Coding System) can be downloaded at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230676408_The_Specific_Affect_Coding_System_SPAFF">researchgate.net</a>. I highly recommend it.</p>
