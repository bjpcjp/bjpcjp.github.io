			Many advertisers depict people consuming their product surrounded by other people. However, advertisers are beginning to depict people consuming their products in secret. For example, Breyer’s advertises its line of gelato by showing a couple waiting for their children to go to bed so they can secretly enjoy eating their gelato. King’s Hawaiian’s advertises its dinner rolls through a humorous ad showing a man keeping his consumption of dinner rolls secret by hiding them in a hidden wall cabinet. And the city of Las Vegas has been running a campaign shrouded in secrecy for some years now with its slogan “What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas.”
