<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>A. Customer Solution Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-001.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">The Customer Solution Profit model involves investing substantial time upfront to deeply understand customer needs, then customizing offerings to specifically address those needs. While losing money initially, this lays the foundation for significant long-term profits from closely tailored solutions.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>B. Pyramid Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-004.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Pyramid Profit refers to methodically covering all price points in a market by offering low-, medium-, and high-end product versions. This locks out competition from entering at the low end, while generating strong margins at the high end. The model creates a "firewall" at the base and big profits at the apex of the pyramid.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>C. Multi-Component Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-006.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">The Multi-Component Profit model involves disaggregating a business into its various components and maximizing the profit opportunities specifically from the highest-margin elements. As different components can have widely varying levels of profitability, this focus isolates and intensifies the most lucrative pieces.</div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider"><strong>D. Switchboard Profit</strong></div>
<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-007.jpg"/></div>
<div class="card-section">Switchboard Profit consists of controlling the critical connections between suppliers and customers in an industry, serving as an intermediary "switchboard" between the two sides. By reaching a critical mass of relationships on both ends, a company can extract substantial value from brokering the exchanges across its platform.</div></div> 

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider"><strong>E. Time Profit</strong></div>
<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-008.jpg"/></div>
<div class="card-section">With Time Profit, early heavy investment is used to establish a strong position and mindshare in a nascent market. Margins are high as competitors have yet to enter. Investment is gradually reduced as more competition intensifies and margins decline in later phases of the mature market.</div></div> 

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>F. Blockbuster Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-section">The Blockbuster Profit model entails concentrating resources and talent on nurturing select offerings that have potential home-run status into "blockbuster" hits. Careful risk management ensures failures are cut quickly, while all efforts focus on propelling likely big winners. Upside is maximized while downside is minimized.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>G. Profit-Multiplier Model</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-009.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Profit Multiplier involves reusing or repurposing successful offerings by tailoring them to multiple markets and customer segments, improving the odds of success while reducing required investments and costs. Like a tree branching out, a single base product or service is leveraged extensively.</div></div>  

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>H. Entrepreneurial Profit</strong></div>

	<div class="card-section">Entrepreneurial Profit emphasizes relentless efficiency and cost discipline throughout all operations. Saving pennies on costs while vigorously boosting revenues can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and profitability fueled by the collective energy and culture.</div></div>  

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>I. Specialist Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-010.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">With Specialist Profit, a company thoroughly dominates a niche market space by understanding specific customer needs better than anyone else. Margins can substantially exceed those of generalists competing more broadly across segments. Deep connection with the target segment also speeds sales cycles and provides customer loyalty.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>J. Installed Base Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-011.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Installed Base Profit relies on follow-on sales of supplies, accessories and services to a captive customer base that's made an initial product purchase. Having bought the core offering, customers depend on the seller for crucial after-sale items required for ongoing operations, which can sport extremely high margins.</div></div>  

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>K. De Facto Standard Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-section">De Facto Standard Profit emerges when a company's product or system becomes the entrenched standard across an industry. Buyers may actively market it to others as they want compatible systems adopted. Significant advantages accrue to the standard setter, with cost and marketing efficiencies unlocked.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>L. Brand Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-012.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Brand Profit results from cumulative investment in advertising and promotion gradually cementing strong brand equity and customer loyalty over time. This allows for premium pricing and insulation against economic volatility. Maintaining consistent messaging that resonates with the target market is critical.</div></div>  

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>M. Specialty Product Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-013.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Specialty Product Profit comes from patented products that enjoy temporary monopoly-like economics, with high margins and customer dependence until alternatives emerge. Managing the portfolio pipeline via careful project selection and resource allocation is imperative to ride successive waves of temporary exclusivity.</div></div>
 
<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>N. Local Leadership Profit</strong></div>  
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-014.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">A Local Leadership position emerges when a company concentrates on thoroughly dominating a geographic territory, saturating it by blocking rivals. This limits competitors' scale, keeping profits robust even in unattractive industry spaces. Regional leadership fuels expansion into adjacent territories.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>O. Transaction Scale Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-016.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Transaction Scale Profit prioritizes large, higher-margin sales over maximizing transaction volume, purposely turning away smaller, less profitable orders. Cultivating relationships with big-spending customers and configuring operations to simplify serving this top tier underpins this approach's success.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>P. Value Chain Position Profit</strong></div>  
	<div class="card-section">Value Chain Position Profit means controlling the most strategically important Leverage Points within an industry rather than across the overall value chain. These choke points see high volumes pass through, can dictate terms and conditions, and wield influence over ecosystem-wide activities.</div></div> 

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>Q. Cycle Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-023.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Cycle Profit refers to proactively managing margins over the fluctuations of business cycles by adeptly adjusting pricing in anticipation of swings. Buoying prices early helps build war chests to weather downturns, while disciplined reductions during peaks keeps demand roaring. A moderated trajectory of earnings emerges.</div></div>
 
<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>R. After-Sale Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-section">After-Sale Profit capitalizes on lucrative, sustained sales of follow-on items flowing from initial product purchases. By controlling crucial supplies, upgrades, accessories or services that enable customers' continued use of core product, incredibly high margins can be captured thanks to low price sensitivity.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>S. New Product Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-026.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-027.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">New Product Profit aims to aggressively invest in and pump up sales of hot new offerings during growth boom times when margins are fat, then systematically withdraw as more competition enters, ushering decline. Being first to catch and depart the trend waves is key, while resisting being swept up in the frenzy.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>T. Relative Market Share Profit</strong></div>
	<div class="card-image"><img src="{{pxpath}}/image-028.jpg"/></div>
	<div class="card-section">Relative Market Share Profit means leveraging commanding scale leadership to dictate favorable terms, attract premium talent, drive the largest innovations, gain invaluable customer intelligence and influence ecosystem evolution. Robust margins and stability result from this self-reinforcing competitive dominance.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>U. Experience Curve Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-section">Experience Curve Profit relies on aggressively stripping out costs as operations scale, tracking detailed performance to optimize improvements over time. Maintaining zealous focus here while avoiding the blindness of overfocus is key to surfing down the cost curve ahead of rivals amid market turbulence.</div></div>

<div class="card">
	<div class="card-divider"><strong>V. Low-Cost Business Design Profit</strong></div> 
	<div class="card-section">Low-Cost Business Design delivers 10X cost advantages woven into operations DNA through transformed processes and elimination of unnecessary expenses. Fresh, blank-sheet thinking spawns creative new models that obsolete prior orthodoxies by unlocking major efficiencies rivals can't match.</div></div>

<div class="card"><div class="card-divider"><strong>W. Digital Profit</strong></div>
<div class="card-section">Digital Profit represents the massive performance improvements and customer empowerment enabled in digitized processes, from supply chains to sales. Enabling self-service and systematizing activities lead to radically higher productivity and profitability, invalidating certain traditional profit models.</div></div>
