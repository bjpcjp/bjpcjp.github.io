Focused on product and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems.&#91;1&#93; It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of the problem by determining the root causes. Although it originally comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the PDCA cycle. The disciplines are:</p>

          <p>Failure mode and effects analysis is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis, but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate models are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.</p>

          <p>‚ÄòThe Problem with‚Ä¶‚Äô series covers controversial topics related to efforts to improve healthcare quality, including widely recommended but deceptively difficult strategies for improvement and pervasive problems that seem to resist solution.  The ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô technique is one of the most widely taught approaches to root-cause analysis (RCA) in healthcare. Its use is promoted by the WHO,1 the English National Health Service,2 the Institute for Healthcare Improvement,3 the Joint Commission4 and many other organisations in the field of healthcare quality and safety. Like most such tools, though, its popularity is not the result of any evidence that it is effective.5‚Äì8 Instead, it probably owes its place in the curriculum and practice of RCA to a combination of pedigree, simplicity and pedagogy.  In terms of pedigree, ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô traces its roots back to the Toyota Production System (TPS).9 It also plays a key role in Lean10 (a generic version of TPS) as well as Six Sigma,11 another popular quality improvement (QI) methodology. Taiichi Ohno describes ‚Äò5 whys‚Äô as central to the TPS methodology:The basis of Toyota's scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem ‚Ä¶ By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear. The solution, or the how-to, is designated as ‚Äò1H.‚Äô Thus, ‚ÄòFive whys equal one how‚Äô (5W=1H). (ref. 9, p. 123)  This quote also makes the case for the technique's simplicity. Asking ‚Äòwhy‚Äô five times allows users to arrive at a single root cause that might not have been obvious at the outset. It may also inspire a single solution to address that root cause (though it is not clear that the ‚Äò1H‚Äô side of the equation has been adopted as widely).  The pedagogical argument for ‚Ä¶</p>
