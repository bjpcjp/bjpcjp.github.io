	<div class="card-section">
		<p>Just a quick note - anytime you create a Rails v6 application, <strong>be sure to 
			1) upgrade your Webpacker gem from 4.x to (at least) 5.3, then
			2) run <code>rails webpacker:install</code> afterwards.</strong></p>
		<p>This is to avoid a missing manifest.json error that appears when you attempt to view a new scaffold.</p>
