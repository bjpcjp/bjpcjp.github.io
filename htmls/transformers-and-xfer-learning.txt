One of the key reasons Transformers were able to so quickly take over most NLP leaderboards is their ability to quickly adapt to other tasks, a.k.a. Transfer learning. Pretrained Transformer models can adapt extremely easily and quickly to tasks they have not been trained on, and that has huge advantages. As an ML practitioner, you no longer need to train a large model on a huge dataset.
