          <p>Which layout of an advertisement leads to more clicks? Would a different color or position of the purchase button lead to a higher conversion rate? Does a special offer really attract more customers – and which of two phrasings would be better? For a long time, people have trusted their gut feeling to answer these questions. Today all these questions could be answered by conducting an A/B test. For this purpose, visitors of a website are randomly assigned to one of two groups between which the target metric (i.e. click-through rate, conversion rate…) can then be compared. Due to this randomization, the groups do not systematically differ in all other relevant dimensions. This means: If your target metric takes a significantly higher value in one group, you can be quite sure that it is because of your treatment and not because of any other variable. In comparison to other methods, conducting an A/B test does not require extensive statistical knowledge. Nevertheless, some caveats have to be taken into account. When making a statistical decision, there are two possible errors (see also table 1): A Type I error means that we observe a significant result although there is no real difference between our groups. A Type II error means that we do not observe a significant result although there is in fact a difference. The Type I error can be controlled and set to a fixed number in advance, e.g., at 5%, often denoted as α or the significance level. The Type II error in contrast cannot be controlled directly. It decreases with the sample size and the magnitude of the actual effect. When, for example, one of the designs performs way better than the other one, it’s more likely that the difference is actually detected by the test in comparison to a situation where there is only a small difference with respect to the target metric. Therefore, the required sample size can be computed in advance, given α and the minimum effect size you want to be able to detect (statistical power analysis). Knowing the average traffic on the website you can get a rough idea of the time you have to wait for the test to complete. Setting the rule for the end of the test in advance is often called “fixed-horizon testing”. Table 1: Overview over possible errors and correct decisions in statistical tests Effect really exists No Yes Statistical test is significant No True negative Type II error (false negative) Yes Type I error (false positive) True positive Statistical tests generally provide the p-value which reflects the probability of obtaining the observed result (or an even more extreme one) just by chance, given that there is no effect. If the p-value is smaller than α, the result is denoted as “significant”. When running an A/B test you may not always want to wait until the end but take a look from time to time to see how the test performs. What if you suddenly observe that your p-value has already fallen below your significance level – doesn’t that mean that the winner has already been identified and you could stop the test? Although this conclusion is very appealing, it can also be very wrong. The p-value fluctuates strongly during the experiment and even if the p-value at the end of the fixed-horizon is substantially larger than α, it can go below α at some point during the experiment. This is the reason why looking at your p-value several times is a little bit like cheating, because it makes your actual probability of a Type I error substantially larger than the α you chose in advance. This is called “α inflation”. At best you only change the color or position of a button although it does not have any impact. At worst, your company provides a special offer which causes costs but actually no gain. The more often you check your p-value during the data collection, the more likely you are to draw wrong conclusions. In short: As attractive as it may seem, don’t stop your A/B test early just because you are observing a significant result. In fact you can prove that if you increase your time horizon to infinity, you are guaranteed to get a significant p-value at some point in time. The following code simulates some data and plots the course of the p-value during the test. (For the first samples which are still very small R returns a warning that the chi square approximation may be incorrect.) library(timeDate) library(ggplot2) # Choose parameters: pA</p>

          <p>Machine learning is the study and application of algorithms that learn from and make predictions on data. From search results to self-driving cars, it has manifested itself in all areas of our lives and is one of the most exciting and fast-growing fields of research in the world of data science. The caret package, maintained by Max Kuhn, is the go-to package in the R community for predictive modeling and supervised learning. This widely used package provides a consistent interface to all of R's most powerful machine learning facilities. Need some more convincing? In this post, we explore 3 reasons why you should learn the caret package. Afterward, you can take DataCamp's Machine Learning Toolbox course taught by Zachary Deane-Mayer & Max Kuhn, co-authors of the caret package! 1. It can help you get a data science job Ever read through data science job postings and see words like "predictive modeling", "classification", "regression," or "machine learning"? Chances are if you are seeking a data science position, you will be expected to have experience and knowledge about all of these topics. Luckily, the caret package has you covered. The caret package is known as the "Swiss Army Knife" for machine learning with R; capable of performing many tasks with an intuitive, consistent format. Check out these recent data scientist job postings from Kaggle which are all seeking candidates with knowledge of R and machine learning: Data Scientist Analytics at Booking.com Data Scientist at Amazon.com Data Scientist at CVS Health 2. It's one of the most popular R packages The caret package receives over 38,000 direct downloads monthly making it one of the most popular packages in the R community. With that comes significant benefits including an abundant amount of documentation and helpful tutorials. You can install the Rdocumentation package to access helpful documentation and community examples directly in your R console. Simply copy and paste the following code: # Install and load RDocumentation for comprehensive help with R packages and functions install.packages("RDocumentation") library("RDocumentation") Of course, another benefit of learning a widely used package is that your colleagues are also likely using caret in their work - meaning you can collaborate on projects more easily. Additionally, caret is a dependent package for a large amount of additional machine learning and modeling packages as well. Understanding how caret works will make it easier and more fluid to learn even more helpful R packages. 3. It's easy to learn, but very powerful If you are a beginner R user, the caret package provides an easy interface for performing complex tasks. For example, you can train multiple different types of models with one easy, convenient format. You can also monitor various combinations of parameters and evaluate performance to understand their impact on the model you are trying to build. Additionally, the caret package helps you decide the most suitable model by comparing their accuracy and performance for a specific problem. Complete the code challenge below to see just how easy it is to to build models and predict values with caret. We've already gone ahead and split the mtcars dataset into a training set, train, and a test set,test. Both of these objects are available in the console. Your goal is to predict the miles per gallon of each car in the test dataset based on their weight. See for yourself how the caret package can handle this task with just two lines of code! 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 Want to learn it for yourself?

        <div class="card-section">
          <p>With roots dating back to at least 1662 when John Graunt, a London merchant, published an extensive set of inferences based on mortality records, survival analysis is one of the oldest subfields of Statistics [1]. Basic life-table methods, including techniques for dealing with censored data, were discovered before 1700 [2], and in the early eighteenth century, the old masters - de Moivre working on annuities, and Daniel Bernoulli studying competing risks for the analysis of smallpox inoculation - developed the modern foundations of the field [2]. Today, survival analysis models are important in Engineering, Insurance, Marketing, Medicine, and many more application areas. So, it is not surprising that R should be rich in survival analysis functions. CRAN’s Survival Analysis Task View, a curated list of the best relevant R survival analysis packages and functions, is indeed formidable. We all owe a great deal of gratitude to Arthur Allignol and Aurielien Latouche, the task view maintainers. Looking at the Task View on a small screen, however, is a bit like standing too close to a brick wall - left-right, up-down, bricks all around. It is a fantastic edifice that gives some idea of the significant contributions R developers have made both to the theory and practice of Survival Analysis. As well-organized as it is, however, I imagine that even survival analysis experts need some time to find their way around this task view. Newcomers - people either new to R or new to survival analysis or both - must find it overwhelming. So, it is with newcomers in mind that I offer the following narrow trajectory through the task view that relies on just a few packages: survival, ggplot2, ggfortify, and ranger The survival package is the cornerstone of the entire R survival analysis edifice. Not only is the package itself rich in features, but the object created by the Surv() function, which contains failure time and censoring information, is the basic survival analysis data structure in R. Dr. Terry Therneau, the package author, began working on the survival package in 1986. The first public release, in late 1989, used the Statlib service hosted by Carnegie Mellon University. Thereafter, the package was incorporated directly into Splus, and subsequently into R. ggfortify enables producing handsome, one-line survival plots with ggplot2::autoplot. ranger might be the surprise in my very short list of survival packages. The ranger() function is well-known for being a fast implementation of the Random Forests algorithm for building ensembles of classification and regression trees. But ranger() also works with survival data. Benchmarks indicate that ranger() is suitable for building time-to-event models with the large, high-dimensional data sets important to internet marketing applications. Since ranger() uses standard Surv() survival objects, it’s an ideal tool for getting acquainted with survival analysis in this machine-learning age. Load the data This first block of code loads the required packages, along with the veteran dataset from the survival package that contains data from a two-treatment, randomized trial for lung cancer. library(survival) library(ranger) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(ggfortify) #------------ data(veteran) head(veteran) ## trt celltype time status karno diagtime age prior ## 1 1 squamous 72 1 60 7 69 0 ## 2 1 squamous 411 1 70 5 64 10 ## 3 1 squamous 228 1 60 3 38 0 ## 4 1 squamous 126 1 60 9 63 10 ## 5 1 squamous 118 1 70 11 65 10 ## 6 1 squamous 10 1 20 5 49 0 The variables in veteran are: * trt: 1=standard 2=test * celltype: 1=squamous, 2=small cell, 3=adeno, 4=large * time: survival time in days * status: censoring status * karno: Karnofsky performance score (100=good) * diagtime: months from diagnosis to randomization * age: in years * prior: prior therapy 0=no, 10=yes Kaplan Meier Analysis The first thing to do is to use Surv() to build the standard survival object. The variable time records survival time; status indicates whether the patient’s death was observed (status = 1) or that survival time was censored (status = 0). Note that a “+” after the time in the print out of km indicates censoring. # Kaplan Meier Survival Curve km</p>

          <p>Nicolas Nguyen works in the Supply Chain industry, in the area of Demand and Supply Planning, S&OP and Analytics, where he enjoys developing solutions using R and Shiny. Outside his job, he teaches data visualization in R at the Engineering School EIGSI and Business School Excelia in the city of La Rochelle, France. Introduction Demand & Supply Planning requires forecasting techniques to determine the inventory needed to fulfill future orders. With R, we can build end-to-end supply chain monitoring processes to identify potential issues and run scenario testing. In a 3-part series, I will walk through a Demand & Supply Planning workflow: Using R in Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting: an introduction of projected inventory and coverage methodology (this post) Analyzing Projected Inventory Calculations Using R: an analysis of a demo dataset using the planr package Visualizing Projected Calculations with reactable and shiny: once the analysis is done, how would you present your results to your boss? By the end of the series, you will understand how and why to use R for Demand & Supply Planning calculations. Let’s begin! The “problem” we aim to solve When we work in Demand & Supply Planning, it’s pretty common that we need to calculate projected inventories (and related projected coverages). We often have three options to perform this calculation, using: an APS (Advanced Planning System) software an ERP, such as SAP or JDE and of course…Excel! All are fine and have different pros and cons. For example, we simply sometimes don’t have all the data in our ERP either APS, like when we work with third-party distributors or we want to model a supply chain network that relies on different systems with unconnected data. How about using R to perform these calculations? How simple and fast could they be? And, could we do more than just the calculations? For example, could we get an analysis of the projected situation of a portfolio (as an output of a function), so we don’t have to look at each product one by one and can instead: Easily get a summary view of the portfolio? Then zoom on the products with risks of shortages or overstocks? In a series of posts, I will demonstrate how R can help us in Demand & Supply planning. This first post introduces the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions for projected inventory and coverage calculations. proj_inv(): to calculate projected inventories and coverages with some analysis features light_proj_inv(): to calculate projected inventories and coverages (only) Runs faster than the previous function (as it’s lighter and doesn’t provide any analysis features) With R, we have an efficient way to run end-to-end supply chain monitoring processes. Methodology How to calculate projected inventories First, let’s have a look at an example of how to calculate projected inventories. Consider that the field Demand = Sales Forecasts. We start with some Opening Inventory of 1000 units. During month M, we sell 100 units (the Demand). At the end of the 1st period (Month M), the inventory is 900 units. Then, there’s a demand of 800 units at the end of the following period (Month M+1). During the period (Month M+2), we get a Supply of 400 units, and sell 100: it is now 1100 units in stock. That’s all, this is how we calculate projected inventories ☺ Figure 1: Describes the mechanism of the calculation of projected inventories based on Opening Inventories, Demand and Supply How to calculate projected coverages Now, let’s have a look at how to calculate projected coverages. The idea: we look forward. We consider the projected inventories at the end of a period and evaluate the related coverage based on the Upcoming Demand. See the example below: Figure 2: Description of the calculation of projected coverages, considering the inventories at a point in time and the Upcoming Demand If we use Excel, we often see a “shortcut” to estimate the related coverages, like considering an average of the Demand over the next 3 or 6 months. This can lead to incorrect results if the Demand is not constant (if we have some seasonality or a strong trend, for example). However, these calculations become very easy through the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions. Projected inventory calculations in R Now, let’s see how the above is done using two functions from the planr package. First, let’s create a tibble of data for the example shown above (we will cover Min.Stocks.Coverage and Max.Stocks.Coverage more thoroughly in another post): # Install the planr package # remotes::install_github("nguyennico/planr") library(planr) library(dplyr) Planr_Example % select(Projected.Inventories.Qty) ## # A tibble: 7 × 2 ## # Groups: DFU [1] ## DFU Projected.Inventories.Qty ## ## 1 Item0001 900 ## 2 Item0001 800 ## 3 Item0001 1100 ## 4 Item0001 300 ## 5 Item0001 200 ## 6 Item0001 -100 ## 7 Item0001 200 We can also take a look at projected coverage. It matches our example calculation in Figure 2: the opening coverage is 2.9 months. Calculated_Inv %>% select(Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods) ## # A tibble: 7 × 2 ## # Groups: DFU [1] ## DFU Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods ## ## 1 Item0001 2.9 ## 2 Item0001 1.9 ## 3 Item0001 2.7 ## 4 Item0001 1.7 ## 5 Item0001 0.7 ## 6 Item0001 0 ## 7 Item0001 99 Very easy to calculate! The proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions can also be used and combined to perform more complex tasks. I’ve described several use cases in the appendix. Moving forward, these functions form the basis for the classic DRP (Distribution Requirement Planning) calculation, where, based on some parameters (usually minimum and maximum levels of stock, a reorder quantity, and a frozen horizon), we calculate a Replenishment Plan. Conclusion Thank you for reading this introduction of projected inventories and coverages in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope that you enjoyed reading how this methodology translate into R. ASCM (formerly APICS) guidelines In the beginning of 2019, the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) published an article about the usage of R (and Python) in Supply Chain Planning, and more precisely for the Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) process, which is related to Demand and Supply Planning. Figure 3: An extract from the ASCM article regarding the S&OP and Digital Supply Chain. It shows how R and Python are becoming more and more used for demand & supply planning and are great tools to run a S&OP process. In the example above, we can see how R helps build the digital environment useful to run the S&OP process, which involves a lot of data processing. The planr package aims to support this process by providing functions that calculate projected inventories. Stay tuned for more on projected calculations using R Thank you for reading the introduction on how to use R for projected inventory calculations in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope you enjoyed this introduction to the planr package. My series of posts will continue with: Analyzing Projected Calculations Using R (using a demo dataset) Visualizing Projected Calculations with reactable and Shiny (or, what your boss wants to see) In the meantime, check out these useful links: planr package GitHub repository: https://github.com/nguyennico/planr URL for a Shiny app showing a demo of the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions: Demo: app proj_inv() function (shinyapps.io) Appendix: Use cases and examples The proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions can easily be used and combined to perform more complex tasks, such as: Modeling of a Supply Chain Network Calculation of projected inventories from Raw Materials to Finished Goods A multi-echelon distribution network: from a National Distribution Center to Regional Wholesalers to Retailers Becoming a useful tool: To build an End-to-End Supply Chain monitoring process To support the S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning) process, allowing us to run some scenarios quickly: Change of Sales plan Change of Supply (Production) plan Change of stock level parameters Change of Transit Time Etc. Here are some detailed use cases for the functions. Third-party distributors We sometimes work with third-party distributors to distribute our products. A common question is: how much stock do our partners hold? If we have access to their opening inventories and Sales IN & OUT Forecasts, we can quickly calculate the projected inventories by applying the proj_inv() or light_proj_inv() functions. Then, we anticipate any risks of shortages or overstocks, and create a collaborative workflow. Figure 4: Illustration of a SiSo (Sales IN Sales OUT) situation. We have some stocks held at a storage location, for example, a third-party distributor, and know what will be sold out of this location (the sales out) and what will be replenished to it (the sales in), as well as the opening inventory. The aim is to calculate the projected inventories and coverages at this location. From raw materials to finished goods In the example below, we produce olive oil (but it could be shampoo, liquor, etc.). We start with a raw material, the olive oil, that we use to fill up different sizes of bottles (35cl, 50cl, etc…), on which we then apply (stick) a label (and back label). There are different labels, depending on the languages (markets where the products are sold). Once we have a labelled bottle, we put it inside an outer box, ready to be shipped and sold. There are different dimensions of outer boxes, where we can put, for examplem 4, 6 or 12 bottles. They are the Finished Goods. We have two groups of products here: Finished Goods Semi-Finished: at different steps, filled bottle (not yet labelled) or labelled bottle We might be interested in looking at the projected inventories at different levels / steps of the manufacturing process: Finished Goods Raw Materials: naked bottles, labels, or liquid (olive oil) Semi-Finished Products For this, we can apply the proj_inv() or light_proj_inv() functions on each level of analysis.

          <p>It’s March 2023 and right now ChatGPT, the amazing AI chatbot tool from OpenAI, is all the rage. But when OpenAI released their public web API for ChatGPT on the 1st of March you might have been a bit disappointed. If you’re an R user, that is. Because, when scrolling through the release announcement you find that there is a python package to use this new API, but no R package. I’m here to say: Don’t be disappointed! As long as there is a web API for a service then it’s going to be easy to use this service from R, no specialized package needed. So here’s an example of how to use the new (as of March 2023) ChatGPT API from R. But know that when the next AI API hotness comes out (likely April 2023, or so) then it’s going to be easy to interface with that from R, as well. Calling the ChatGPT web API from R To use the ChatGPT API in any way you first need to sign up and get an API key: The “password” you need to access the web API. It could look something like "sk-5xWWxmbnJvbWU4-M212Z2g5dzlu-MzhucmI5Yj-l4c2RkdmZ26". Of course, that’s not my real API key because that’s something you should keep secret! With an API key at hand you now look up the documentation and learn that this is how you would send a request to the API from the terminal: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is a banana?"}] }' But how do we send a request to the API using R? What we can do is to “replicate” this call using httr: a popular R package to send HTTP requests. Here’s how this request would be made using httr (with the curl lines as comments above the corresponding httr code) library(httr) api_key</p>

          <p>In January 2016, I was honored to receive an “Honorable Mention” of the John Chambers Award 2016. This article was written for R-bloggers, whose builder, Tal Galili, kindly invited me to write an introduction to the rARPACK package. A Short Story of rARPACK Eigenvalue decomposition is a commonly used technique in numerous statistical problems. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) basically conducts eigenvalue decomposition on the sample covariance of a data matrix: the eigenvalues are the component variances, and eigenvectors are the variable loadings. In R, the standard way to compute eigenvalues is the eigen() function. However, when the matrix becomes large, eigen() can be very time-consuming: the complexity to calculate all eigenvalues of a $n times n$ matrix is $O(n^3)$. While in real applications, we usually only need to compute a few eigenvalues or eigenvectors, for example to visualize high dimensional data using PCA, we may only use the first two or three components to draw a scatterplot. Unfortunately in eigen(), there is no option to limit the number of eigenvalues to be computed. This means that we always need to do the full eigen decomposition, which can cause a huge waste in computation. And this is why the rARPACK package was developed. As the name indicates, rARPACK was originally an R wrapper of the ARPACK library, a FORTRAN package that is used to calculate a few eigenvalues of a square matrix. However ARPACK has stopped development for a long time, and it has some compatibility issues with the current version of LAPACK. Therefore to maintain rARPACK in a good state, I wrote a new backend for rARPACK, and that is the C++ library Spectra. The name of rARPACK was POORLY designed, I admit. Starting from version 0.8-0, rARPACK no longer relies on ARPACK, but due to CRAN polices and reverse dependence, I have to keep using the old name. Features and Usage The usage of rARPACK is simple. If you want to calculate some eigenvalues of a square matrix A, just call the function eigs() and tells it how many eigenvalues you want (argument k), and which eigenvalues to calculate (argument which). By default, which = "LM" means to pick the eigenvalues with the largest magnitude (modulus for complex numbers and absolute value for real numbers). If the matrix is known to be symmetric, calling eigs_sym() is preferred since it guarantees that the eigenvalues are real. library(rARPACK) set.seed(123) ## Some random data x = matrix(rnorm(1000 * 100), 1000) ## If retvec == FALSE, we don't calculate eigenvectors eigs_sym(cov(x), k = 5, which = "LM", opts = list(retvec = FALSE)) For really large data, the matrix is usually in sparse form. rARPACK supports several sparse matrix types defined in the Matrix package, and you can even pass an implicit matrix defined by a function to eigs(). See ?rARPACK::eigs for details. library(Matrix) spmat = as(cov(x), "dgCMatrix") eigs_sym(spmat, 2) ## Implicitly define the matrix by a function that calculates A %*% x ## Below represents a diagonal matrix diag(c(1:10)) fmat = function(x, args) { return(x * (1:10)) } eigs_sym(fmat, 3, n = 10, args = NULL) From Eigenvalue to SVD An extension to eigenvalue decomposition is the singular value decomposition (SVD), which works for general rectangular matrices. Still take PCA as an example. To calculate variable loadings, we can perform an SVD on the centered data matrix, and the loadings will be contained in the right singular vectors. This method avoids computing the covariance matrix, and is generally more stable and accurate than using cov() and eigen(). Similar to eigs(), rARPACK provides the function svds() to conduct partial SVD, meaning that only part of the singular pairs (values and vectors) are to be computed. Below shows an example that computes the first three PCs of a 2000x500 matrix, and I compare the timings of three different algorithms: library(microbenchmark) set.seed(123) ## Some random data x = matrix(rnorm(2000 * 500), 2000) pc = function(x, k) { ## First center data xc = scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) ## Partial SVD decomp = svds(xc, k, nu = 0, nv = k) return(list(loadings = decomp$v, scores = xc %*% decomp$v)) } microbenchmark(princomp(x), prcomp(x), pc(x, 3), times = 5) The princomp() and prcomp() functions are the standard approaches in R to do PCA, which will call eigen() and svd() respectively. On my machine (Fedora Linux 23, R 3.2.3 with optimized single-threaded OpenBLAS), the timing results are as follows: Unit: milliseconds expr min lq mean median uq max neval princomp(x) 274.7621 276.1187 304.3067 288.7990 289.5324 392.3211 5 prcomp(x) 306.4675 391.9723 408.9141 396.8029 397.3183 552.0093 5 pc(x, 3) 162.2127 163.0465 188.3369 163.3839 186.1554 266.8859 5 Applications SVD has some interesting applications, and one of them is image compression. The basic idea is to perform a partial SVD on the image matrix, and then recover it using the calculated singular values and singular vectors. Below shows an image of size 622x1000: (Orignal image) If we use the first five singular pairs to recover the image, then we need to store 8115 elements, which is only 1.3% of the original data size. The recovered image will look like below: (5 singular pairs) Even if the recovered image is quite blurred, it already reveals the main structure of the original image. And if we increase the number of singular pairs to 50, then the difference is almost imperceptible, as is shown below. (50 singular pairs) There is also a nice Shiny App developed by Nan Xiao, Yihui Xie and Tong He that allows users to upload an image and visualize the effect of compression using this algorithm. The code is available on GitHub. Performance Finally, I would like to use some benchmark results to show the performance of rARPACK. As far as I know, there are very few packages available in R that can do the partial eigenvalue decomposition, so the results here are based on partial SVD. The first plot compares different SVD functions on a 1000x500 matrix, with dense format on the left panel, and sparse format on the right. The second plot shows the results on a 5000x2500 matrix. The functions used corresponding to the axis labels are as follows: svd: svd() from base R, which computes the full SVD irlba: irlba() from irlba package, partial SVD propack, trlan: propack.svd() and trlan.svd() from svd package, partial SVD svds: svds() from rARPACK The code for benchmark and the environment to run the code can be found here.</p>

Many in my audience were adult students coming back to school with job experience writing code in Java, Python and SAS.

          <p>Release 1.4 of the magick package introduces a new feature called image convolution that was requested by Thomas L. Pedersen. In this post we explain what this is all about. Kernel Matrix The new image_convolve() function applies a kernel over the image. Kernel convolution means that each pixel value is recalculated using the weighted neighborhood sum defined in the kernel matrix. For example lets look at this simple kernel: library(magick) kern % image_negate() As with the blurring, the original image can be blended in with the transformed one, effectively sharpening the image along edges. img %>% image_convolve('DoG:0,0,2', scaling = '100, 100%') The ImageMagick documentation has more examples of convolve with various avaiable kernels.</p>
