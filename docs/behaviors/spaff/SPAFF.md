The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)
James A. Coan
John M. Gottman
267
In 1989, Gottman and Krokoff introduced the Specific Af-
fect Coding System (SPAFF) for the purpose of systemati-
cally observing affective behavior in the context of marital
conflict. The original SPAFF conferred a host of advantages
over earlier “microanalytic” coding strategies, the primary
innovation being the ability to code affect at the construct
level instead of at the level of extremely discrete bits of be-
havior, such as specific gestures or facial movements (Gott-
man, McCoy, Coan, & Collier, 1995).
Since its debut, the SPAFF has, in one version or another,
informed dozens of published scientific findings deriving
from numerous laboratories (e.g., Burman, Margolin, & John,
1993; Carstensen, Gottman, & Levenson, 1995; Coan, Gott-
man, Babcock, & Jacobson, 1997; Cohan & Bradbury, 1994,
1997; Jacobson et al., 1994; Notarius, Benson, Sloane,
Vanzetti, & Hornyak, 1989). For example, the SPAFF has
been used to study affective behavior among newlyweds (Cohan
& Bradbury, 1997; Gottman, Coan, Carrere, & Swanson,
1998), domestically violent couples (Babcock, Waltz, Jacobson,
& Gottman, 1993; Coan et al., 1997), couples in long-term
marriages (Carstensen et al., 1995; Levenson, Carstensen, &
Gottman, 1994), and, most recently, gay and lesbian couples
(Gottman, Levenson, Gross, et al., 2003; Gottman, Levenson,
Swanson, et al., 2003). Although initially developed for the
study of emotional communication among romantic couples,
the SPAFF is now used for coding interactions among chil-
dren, their parents, and their peers (Joanne Wu Shortt, per-
sonal communication, April 9, 2002), and even to therapy
situations (Janine Giese-Davis, personal communication,
October 11, 2003). Indeed, individuals in applied settings
have expressed interest in learning the SPAFF (Coan, 1998).
In a recent review of observational couples research, Heyman
(2001) noted that the SPAFF has “by far the best evidence of
construct and criterion validity for its constructs” of all cur-
rent microanalytic coding systems (Heyman, 2001, p. 25).
History of the SPAFF
Early observational coding systems, such as the Marital In-
teraction Coding System (MICS; Hops, Wills, Weiss, &
Patterson, 1972), and the Facial Affect Scoring Technique
(FAST; Ekman, Friesen, & Tomkins, 1971), sought to iden-
tify extremely discrete bits of behavior that might prove useful
in understanding how such behaviors function in the con-
text of interpersonal relationships. Initially, Gottman fol-
lowed in this tradition with the development of the Couples
Interaction Scoring System (CISS; Gottman, 1979). CISS
coders were instructed to hierarchically scan behaviors for
specific cues, starting with the face, moving to the voice, and
finally coding body movements. Notably, the CISS ignored
verbal content altogether. A short while later, frustrated with
perceived inadequacies in the CISS, Gottman sought a revi-
sion of his system that was heavily influenced by the Facial
Action Coding System (FACS; Ekman & Friesen, 1978).
Nevertheless, Gottman’s frustrations mounted as his lists of
268

discrete codable behaviors grew at an alarming rate. As he
recounted in his first published SPAFF manual:
I did not want my summary codes to read something
like: “Husband shows zygomatic major contracts on
face with contraction of the cheek raiser muscle, with
shift downward in fundamental frequency, decrease in
amplitude and voice in a major key and rapid inhala-
tion and exhalation of breath with hut hut vocaliza-
tions.” Instead, I wanted to say that the husband
laughed. (Gottman et al., 1995, p. 3)
The point was not to ignore the identification of zygo-
matic major contractions or modulations of frequency and
amplitude in vocal communication. Rather, the point was
that modern affect coding, although informed by a thor-
ough knowledge of discrete behaviors such as those de-
scribed by Ekman, Scherer, and others (e.g., Banse &
Scherer, 1996; Ekman & Friesen, 1975; Scherer, 1974),
often missed the forest for the trees. Gottman sought to
devise a coding system that made explicit use of discrete
bits of information in the service of describing constructs
representing generalizable human affective behavior. Thus
Gottman reintroduced verbal content to the specification of
those constructs.
Of course, previous microanalytic coding systems had
been used to cluster codes into “macrocodes” or constructs,
but these attempts had been empirical and, in any event, had
often been implemented after the coding had been com-
pleted. Gottman (Gottman et al., 1995) sought instead to let
his coders code theoretically specified constructs directly. This
new approach assumed that coders had, or could be taught,
the ability to integrate a variety of different affective cues into
broader constructs both rapidly and accurately. It was hoped
that such an approach would increase the speed with which
such coding could be done and also that it would render such
coding more reliable and externally valid.
It was from these efforts that the first major version of
the SPAFF was born. The original version of the SPAFF com-
prised 10 gestalt behavior codes: Neutral, Humor, Affection/
Caring, Interest/Curiosity, Anger, Disgust/Scorn/Contempt,
Whining, Sadness, and Fear. This was later expanded to a
second major version that comprised 16 such codes, adding
Surprise and Validation to the positive set and expanding the
negative set to include Belligerence, Dominance, Stonewall-
ing, and Defensiveness, as well as separating Disgust and
Contempt into distinct codes (Gottman et al., 1995). Since
the publication of the first SPAFF manual, the SPAFF has
been revised yet further. This chapter holds to a description
of the SPAFF in its most current form, with a full listing of
its revised and updated list of codes and their indicators. It
also includes advice for training SPAFF coders, for assessing
coding reliability, and for solving various data analytic issues.
Recent innovations in weighting SPAFF codes for use as a
continuous scale, as well as attempts to utilize SPAFF codes
as separate continuous variables, are also described.
Learning to Code Behavior: The Philosophy
of the SPAFF
Among the core ideas underlying the SPAFF is the uncon-
troversial notion that emotions are expressed in a wide vari-
ety of ways and that this variety should be respected. If there
is a second major idea, it is that SPAFF coding requires the
use of human beings with a personal history of interpersonal,
affective communication. Such a personal history provides
access to subtle cues that even many years of strict training
in the identification of discrete physical features may neglect.
Thus learning to observe emotional behavior means, on the
one hand, learning to identify multiple discrete indicators,
any one of which may or may not be present during a par-
ticular emotional episode, and, on the other hand, drawing
from one’s own personal history of affective communication
in order to spot the complexities of behavior that remain
outside the grasp of highly detailed discrete analysis. SPAFF
coding means learning to integrate voice, physical features,
verbal content, and more—indicators that are sometimes
hard to describe (e.g., “positive energy”) but that are easily
grasped by most coders.
SPAFF Codes Are Latent Psychological Constructs
Figure 16.1 depicts, for the purpose of illustration,1 a latent
variable model (cf. Bollen, 2002) representing the SPAFF code
Validation. In this model, the core, latent construct Valida-
tion (represented in the oval) is not directly observable.
Rather, it is assumed to exist and to actually cause the ex-
pression of its various observable indicators (represented as
rectangles). One would not be able to “see” Validation with-
out directly observing at least one of its indicators. An indi-
cator is an objective piece of evidence that any observer can
see or hear directly. It is called an indicator because when it
is present, it literally “indicates” the underlying construct we
are interested in—it tells us that our latent construct is hap-
pening. Importantly, we are rarely interested in any one of
the indicators of Validation per se. Rather, we are interested
in the construct that those indicators indicate. Put another
way, it is of little specific consequence to us as SPAFF cod-
ers whether we observe direct statements of agreement or
apology, whether we observe summarizing behaviors, or
whether we observe head-nodding behavior with eye contact.
These bits of observation are merely the media through which
we become aware of the thing we are really interested in, which
is Validation. We cannot “see” Validation without the presence
of one or more or its indicators, but without the construct of
Validation, those indicators are by themselves of little theo-
retical value. This is true even when discrete and easily iden-
tified behaviors wind up predicting important outcomes, such
as happens, for example, in the association between the “eye
roll” and marital dissolution. The importance of a discrete
behavior such as the eye roll lies in its connection to the con-
struct of contempt (cf. Gottman, 1993b).
The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF)

Physical Features and Cultural Informants
In the language and history of behavior coding, at least two
broad approaches can be identified. These are the physical
features and cultural informant approaches. Physical-features
approaches hold strictly to the detailed description of physi-
cal observables, such as changes in vocal acoustic properties,
facial expressions, specific gestures, and body postures. In
theory, anyone, or nearly anyone, can be taught to be a physi-
cal-features coder; even computers are now becoming ca-
pable of doing so (Xiao, Moriyama, Kanade, & Cohn, 2003).
By contrast, the cultural-informant approach utilizes in-
dividuals who are, for one reason or another, sensitive ob-
servers in a specific cultural setting. They may, for example,
have specific knowledge about a certain culture or group of
cultures and, by virtue of this specific knowledge, be uniquely
capable of decoding the meaning of specific behaviors within
the context of that culture. Anthropologists have employed
cultural informants to study cultures with which they were
not intuitively familiar. Cultural informants aid researchers
in the interpretation of specific observable events.
In SPAFF coding, both physical-features and cultural-
informant approaches are utilized in the service of captur-
ing meaningful affective constructs. In training SPAFF coders,
the assumption is made that most individuals will be sensi-
tive to subtle differences between certain instances of ob-
servable events. Take, for example, an instance in which a
young woman gently rubs her cheek on her shoulder while
making eye contact with her partner. A purely physical-
features approach might note her cheek-shoulder distance
and append that particular unit of distance to a tally of other
such distances for later analysis. Such units of distance
would certainly constitute a kind of information about this
woman. Indeed (as was noted earlier), a computer could
very probably do this kind of coding. However, it is prob-
ably still true that only a live human being with a lifetime
of experience observing people interacting with each other
would be able to distinguish between a cheek rubbed on
the shoulder as part of an emotional display (of, say, coy
affection) versus a cheek rubbed on the shoulder to relieve
an itch.
Such a large and complex number of indicators are
needed to distinguish these two possibilities that computer
algorithms, as sophisticated as they are becoming, are prob-
ably still many years from being able to do so. On the other
hand, a human being—that is, a cultural informant—could
reliably note the difference in an instant, and the difference
is likely to be a meaningful one.
Becoming a Cultural Informant:
Seeing Versus Observing
Perhaps the most recognizable quotation of Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle’s literary creation Sherlock Holmes is “you saw, but
you did not observe.” The line was used to chastise the af-
fable and earnest Dr. Watson, but it applies equally well to
most of us, most of the time. We usually attend to only some
fraction of the sensory information that is available to us.
Most of our time is spent reflexively responding to a kind of
social and affective rhythm, to the pitch and meter of con-
versation, to the style of the clothes people are wearing, to
the moods implied in the ways people carry themselves and
the obvious components of the looks on their faces. All of
these bits of information influence our behaviors, and our
behaviors in turn influence the individuals who are influenc-
ing us. Presumably, our brains “see” all of this information
as it occurs, at least in the sense that the information is caus-
ing us to respond in certain ways, but under ordinary cir-
cumstances, we do not reflect on the information explicitly.
Becoming an effective cultural informant means learning
to be an active observer of the kinds of information just de-
scribed. The first step toward becoming an active observer
simply involves learning to be mindful of the information that
is available at any one moment. For example, when convers-
ing with an office mate, it may be useful to pay close atten-
tion to how he expresses his feelings with his face and to note
what he’s wearing and how he typically carries himself. Such
exercises prompt a number of interesting questions. What,
for example, might this person be intending to communi-
cate other than what he is explicitly saying? Perhaps one
would conclude that he is interested in portraying himself
as a serious and highly skilled worker but also a fun-loving
and adventuresome person in other contexts. Fair enough.
But what is he actually doing to convey this information? In
other words, after we have come to some tentative conclu-
sions about who this person is and what he is trying to tell
us in subtle ways about himself, we can ask the next ques-
tion: How do we know? By doing so, we are already well on
the way to becoming active observers.
Three Rules of People Watching
We have found that active observation can be facilitated with
some simple exercises that we refer to as the rules of people
watching (Gottman et al., 1995). These rules are predicated
on the idea that when people behave in certain characteris-

tic ways, or even in ways that seem specific to certain situa-
tions, they are doing so to portray themselves as a kind of char-
acter. Further, they select behaviors for this purpose from a
set of possible choices of how to act at any one moment. That said,
it is important to recognize that we are not asserting that this
is actually what people are doing most of the time, though it
might be. Rather, our intention is to provide the reader with
ways to approach the problem of people watching so that
he or she can become a more sensitive and more accurate
cultural informant. In other words, what follows are not the
rules of behavior but the rules of the active observation of
behavior. They are rules for becoming an active observer.
Rule 1: View a Behavior as Though It Were Chosen
From a Collection of Possible Alternatives
If one imagines two different people with precisely the same
mild disability, a limp for example, it is possible to imagine
further that each individual will behave differently with re-
gard to the limp he or she copes with. One of them may, for
example, work to minimize the extent of the limp through a
variety of movements designed to keep others from seeing
it. Another may exaggerate the limp, forming it into a kind
of a swagger. The obvious point is that either of them could
have chosen either approach to dealing with the limp, and
there may indeed be other approaches as well. There are
multiple options for incorporating the disability into their
day-to-day behaviors. The other point, however, and perhaps
the less obvious one, is that these options could be thought
of as alternative styles of having a mild disability.
One can imagine a multitude of behavioral styles in a
variety of contexts. People watching at parties can be par-
ticularly useful for this. It is informative to note the variety
of dress, the different kinds of laughter people use, the in-
tensity of the smiles one observes, the degree of physical space
that people maintain, and so forth. Any of these dimensions
of behavior could, in theory, be selected by any of the people
in the room. And yet, certain people “select” only certain
behaviors. The question is why certain people select certain
behaviors, and that leads to rule 2.
Rule 2: View Behavior as if It Were Designed to Portray
a Character in a Play or a Film—as if It Were Written
to Follow a Script
As you watch people at our hypothetical party, it is possible
to image that everyone’s role has been scripted and that one
is actually observing actors working to portray certain char-
acters. When actors begin preparing characters, they are fre-
quently given a number of character attributes that they must
then devise ways of communicating to an audience. Thus,
when an individual at a party begins laughing loudly and
becoming very animated, one might ask, What is it that the
actor is trying to portray about that character? He or she may,
for example, be attempting to communicate that he or she is
uninhibited, spontaneous, and warm. When meeting a new
individual at a party, or indeed in any setting, it can be very
useful to ask the question, I wonder how this person is going to
communicate what he or she is like?
Rule 3: Watch a Person as if You Were an Actor
Who Had to Play That Person in a Film
It is instructive to ask oneself what kinds of behaviors would
be necessary to portray any individual being that one is ob-
serving. This exercise can be as simple, at first, as just try-
ing to mirror his or her behavior. Frequently, your body
will know what to do if you just try to mimic someone. In-
deed, research suggests that mirroring behavior can enhance
one’s ability to code it (e.g., Blairy, Herrera, & Hess, 1999).
Mimic the life of the party and contrast that with the feel-
ing of mimicking the person who seemed to spend the
evening in relative seclusion. Each exercise in imitation
reveals a set of feelings, specific movements, props, and even
attitudes that can assist in the development of active ob-
servation. In practice, the three rules of people watching
can begin the process of becoming comfortable with, and
deliberate about, observing rather than merely seeing. But
when it comes to observational coding, being comfortable
with and deliberate about observing people is only the first
step.
Facial Expressions of the SPAFF
As noted in some detail previously, the SPAFF is not a strictly
physical-features-based coding system. Nevertheless, more
than any other such system, the SPAFF has been heavily in-
fluenced by, and indeed incorporates, the Facial Action C
