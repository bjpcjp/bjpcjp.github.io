Why do some people succeed far more than others? 
There is a story that is usually told about 
extremely successful people, a story that focuses 
on intelligence and ambition. In Outliers Malcolm 
Gladwell argues that the true story of success is 
very different, and that if we want to understand 
how some people thrive, we should spend more 
time looking around them — at such things as 
their family, their birthplace, or even their birth 
date. T h e story of success is more complex — and 
a lot more interesting — than it initially appears. 
Outliers explains what the Beatles and Bill 
Gates have in common, the extraordinary success 
of Asians at math, the hidden advantages of star 
athletes, why all top New York lawyers have the 
same résumé, and the reason you've never heard 
of the world's smartest man — all in terms of gen­
eration, family, culture, and class. It matters what 
year you were born if you want to be a Silicon 
Valley billionaire, Gladwell argues, and it matters 
where you were born if you want to be a suc­
cessful pilot. T h e lives of outliers — those people 
whose achievements fall outside normal experi­
ence — follow a peculiar and unexpected logic, 
and in making that logic plain Gladwell presents a 
fascinating and provocative blueprint for making 
the most of human potential.

In The Tipping Point Malcolm Gladwell 
changed the way we understand the world. 
In Blink he changed the way we think about 
thinking. Outliers will transform the way we 
understand success.

1. 
Roseto Valfortore lies one hundred miles southeast of 
Rome in the Apennine foothills of the Italian province of 
Foggia. In the style of medieval villages, the town is orga-
nized around a large central square. Facing the square is the 
Palazzo Marchesale, the palace of the Saggese family, once 
the great landowner of those parts. An archway to one side 
leads to a church, the Madonna del Carmine—Our Lady 
of Mount Carmine. Narrow stone steps run up the hill-
side, flanked by closely clustered two-story stone houses 
with red-tile roofs.

O U T L I E R S 
For centuries, the paesani of Roseto worked in the 
marble quarries in the surrounding hills, or cultivated the 
fields in the terraced valley below, walking four and five 
miles down the mountain in the morning and then mak­
ing the long journey back up the hill at night. Life was 
hard. The townsfolk were barely literate and desperately 
poor and without much hope for economic betterment 
until word reached Roseto at the end of the nineteenth 
century of the land of opportunity across the ocean. 
In January of 1882, a group of eleven Rosetans—ten 
men and one boy—set sail for New York. They spent 
their first night in America sleeping on the floor of a tav­
ern on Mulberry Street, in Manhattan's Little Italy. Then 
they ventured west, eventually finding jobs in a slate 
quarry ninety miles west of the city near the town of Ban­
gor, Pennsylvania. The following year, fifteen Rosetans 
left Italy for America, and several members of that group 
ended up in Bangor as well, joining their compatriots in 
the slate quarry. Those immigrants, in turn, sent word 
back to Roseto about the promise of the New World, and 
soon one group of Rosetans after another packed their 
bags and headed for Pennsylvania, until the initial stream 
of immigrants became a flood. In 1894 alone, some twelve 
hundred Rosetans applied for passports to America, leav­
ing entire streets of their old village abandoned. 
The Rosetans began buying land on a rocky hillside 
connected to Bangor by a steep, rutted wagon path. They 
built closely clustered two-story stone houses with slate 
roofs on narrow streets running up and down the hillside. 
They built a church and called it Our Lady of Mount Car-
mel and named the main street, on which it stood, Gari-
4 
T H E 
R O S E T O

baldi Avenue, after the great hero of Italian unification. In 
the beginning, they called their town New Italy. But they 
soon changed it to Roseto, which seemed only appropri­
ate given that almost all of them had come from the same 
village in Italy. 
In 1896, a dynamic young priest by the name of Father 
Pasquale de Nisco took over at Our Lady of Mount Car-
mel. De Nisco set up spiritual societies and organized 
festivals. He encouraged the townsfolk to clear the land 
and plant onions, beans, potatoes, melons, and fruit trees 
in the long backyards behind their houses. He gave out 
seeds and bulbs. The town came to life. The Rosetans 
began raising pigs in their backyards and growing grapes 
for homemade wine. Schools, a park, a convent, and a 
cemetery were built. Small shops and bakeries and res­
taurants and bars opened along Garibaldi Avenue. More 
than a dozen factories sprang up making blouses for the 
garment trade. Neighboring Bangor was largely Welsh 
and English, and the next town over was overwhelmingly 
German, which meant—given the fractious relationships 
between the English and Germans and Italians in those 
years—that Roseto stayed strictly for Rosetans. If you 
had wandered up and down the streets of Roseto in Penn­
sylvania in the first few decades after 1900, you would 
have heard only Italian, and not just any Italian but the 
precise southern Foggian dialect spoken back in the Ital­
ian Roseto. Roseto, Pennsylvania, was its own tiny, self-
sufficient world—all but unknown by the society around 
it—and it might well have remained so but for a man 
named Stewart Wolf. 
Wolf was a physician. He studied digestion and the 
5 
O U T L I E R S 
stomach and taught in the medical school at the Univer­
sity of Oklahoma. He spent his summers on a farm in 
Pennsylvania, not far from Roseto — although that, of 
course, didn't mean much, since Roseto was so much in 
its own world that it was possible to live in the next town 
and never know much about it. "One of the times when 
we were up there for the summer—this would have been 
in the late nineteen fifties — I was invited to give a talk 
at the local medical society," Wolf said years later in an 
interview. "After the talk was over, one of the local doc­
tors invited me to have a beer. And while we were having 
a drink, he said, 'You know, I've been practicing for sev­
enteen years. I get patients from all over, and I rarely find 
anyone from Roseto under the age of sixty-five with heart 
disease.' " 
Wolf was taken aback. This was the 1950s, years before 
the advent of cholesterol-lowering drugs and aggressive 
measures to prevent heart disease. Heart attacks were an 
epidemic in the United States. They were the leading cause 
of death in men under the age of sixty-five. It was impossi­
ble to be a doctor, common sense said, and not see heart 
disease. 
Wolf decided to investigate. He enlisted the support 
of some of his students and colleagues from Oklahoma. 
They gathered together the death certificates from resi­
dents of the town, going back as many years as they could. 
They analyzed physicians' records. They took medical 
histories and constructed family genealogies. "We got 
busy," Wolf said. "We decided to do a preliminary study. 
We started in nineteen sixty-one. The mayor said, 'All my 
6 
T H E 
R O S E T O 
M Y S T E R Y 
sisters are going to help you/ He had four sisters. He said, 
'You can have the town council room/ I said, 'Where are 
you going to have council meetings?' He said, 'Well, we'll 
postpone them for a while/ The ladies would bring us 
lunch. We had little booths where we could take blood, do 
EKGs. We were there for four weeks. Then I talked with 
the authorities. They gave us the school for the summer. 
We invited the entire population of Roseto to be tested." 
The results were astonishing. In Roseto, virtually no 
one under fifty-five had died of a heart attack or showed 
any signs of heart disease. For men over sixty-five, the 
death rate from heart disease in Roseto was roughly half 
that of the United States as a whole. The death rate from 
all causes in Roseto, in fact, was 30 to 35 percent lower 
than expected. 
Wolf brought in a friend of his, a sociologist from 
Oklahoma named John Bruhn, to help him. "I hired med­
ical students and sociology grad students as interview­
ers, and in Roseto we went house to house and talked to 
every person aged twenty-one and over," Bruhn remem­
bers. This happened more than fifty years ago, but Bruhn 
still had a sense of amazement in his voice as he described 
what they found. "There was no suicide, no alcoholism, 
no drug addiction, and very little crime. They didn't have 
anyone on welfare. Then we looked at peptic ulcers. They 
didn't have any of those either. These people were dying 
of old age. That's it." 
Wolf's profession had a name for a place like Roseto—a 
place that lay outside everyday experience, where the nor­
mal rules did not apply. Roseto was an outlier. 
7 
O U T L I E R S 
2. 
Wolf's first thought was that the Rosetans must have held 
on to some dietary practices from the Old World that left 
them healthier than other Americans. But he quickly real­
ized that wasn't true. The Rosetans were cooking with 
lard instead of with the much healthier olive oil they had 
used back in Italy. Pizza in Italy was a thin crust with salt, 
oil, and perhaps some tomatoes, anchovies, or onions. 
Pizza in Pennsylvania was bread dough plus sausage, pep-
peroni, salami, ham, and sometimes eggs. Sweets such as 
biscotti and taralli used to be reserved for Christmas and 
Easter; in Roseto they were eaten year-round. When Wolf 
had dieticians analyze the typical Rosetan's eating habits, 
they found that a whopping 41 percent of their calories 
came from fat. Nor was this a town where people got up at 
dawn to do yoga and run a brisk six miles. The Pennsylva-
nian Rosetans smoked heavily and many were struggling 
with obesity. 
If diet and exercise didn't explain the findings, then 
what about genetics? The Rosetans were a close-knit group 
from the same region of Italy, and Wolf's next thought was 
to wonder whether they were of a particularly hardy stock 
that protected them from disease. So he tracked down rela­
tives of the Rosetans who were living in other parts of the 
United States to see if they shared the same remarkable 
good health as their cousins in Pennsylvania. They didn't. 
He then looked at the region where the Rosetans lived. 
Was it possible that there was something about living in the 
foothills of eastern Pennsylvania that was good for their 
health? The two closest towns to Roseto were Bangor, 
8 
T H E 
R O S E T O 
M Y S T E R Y 
which was just down the hill, and Nazareth, a few miles 
away. These were both about the same size as Roseto, and 
both were populated with the same kind of hardworking 
European immigrants. Wolf combed through both towns' 
medical records. For men over sixty-five, the death rates 
from heart disease in Nazareth and Bangor were three 
times that of Roseto. Another dead end. 
What Wolf began to realize was that the secret of 
Roseto wasn't diet or exercise or genes or location. It had 
to be Roseto itself. As Bruhn and Wolf walked around 
the town, they figured out why. They looked at how the 
Rosetans visited one another, stopping to chat in Ital­
ian on the street, say, or cooking for one another in their 
backyards. They learned about the extended family clans 
that underlay the town's social structure. They saw how 
many homes had three generations living under one roof, 
and how much respect grandparents commanded. They 
went to mass at Our Lady of Mount Carmel and saw the 
unifying and calming effect of the church. They counted 
twenty-two separate civic organizations in a town of just 
under two thousand people. They picked up on the partic­
ular egalitarian ethos of the community, which discour­
aged the wealthy from flaunting their success and helped 
the unsuccessful obscure their failures. 
In transplanting the paesani culture of southern Italy 
to the hills of eastern Pennsylvania, the Rosetans had cre­
ated a powerful, protective social structure capable of 
insulating them from the pressures of the modern world. 
The Rosetans were healthy because of where they were 
/row, because of the world they had created for themselves 
in their tiny little town in the hills. 
9 
O U T L I E R S 
"I remember going to Roseto for the first time, and 
you'd see three-generational family meals, all the baker­
ies, the people walking up and down the street, sitting on 
their porches talking to each other, the blouse mills where 
the women worked during the day, while the men worked 
in the slate quarries," Bruhn said. "It was magical." 
When Bruhn and Wolf first presented their findings 
to the medical community, you can imagine the kind of 
skepticism they faced. They went to conferences where 
their peers were presenting long rows of data arrayed in 
complex charts and referring to this kind of gene or that 
kind of physiological process, and they themselves were 
talking instead about the mysterious and magical benefits 
of people stopping to talk to one another on the street and 
of having three generations under one roof. Living a long 
life, the conventional wisdom at the time said, depended 
to a great extent on who we were—that is, our genes. It 
depended on the decisions we made—on what we chose 
to eat, and how much we chose to exercise, and how effec­
tively we were treated by the medical system. No one was 
used to thinking about health in terms of community. 
Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical estab­
lishment to think about health and heart attacks in an 
entirely new way: they had to get them to realize that they 
wouldn't be able to understand why someone was healthy 
if all they did was think about an individual's personal 
choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond 
the individual. They had to understand the culture he or 
she was a part of, and who their friends and families were, 
and what town t
