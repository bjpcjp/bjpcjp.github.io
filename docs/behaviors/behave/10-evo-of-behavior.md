The Evolution of Behavior
t last we reach the foundations. Genes and promoters evolve. As do
transcription factors, transposases, and splicing enzymes. As has every
trait touched by genetic influences (i.e., everything). In the words of the
geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in
the light of evolution.” Including this book.1
E
EVOLUTION 101
volution rests on three steps: (a) certain biological traits are inherited by
genetic means; (b) mutations and gene recombination produce variation in
those traits; (c) some of those variants confer more “fitness” than others. Given
those conditions, over time the frequency of more “fit” gene variants increases in
a population.
We start by trashing some common misconceptions.
First, that evolution favors survival of the fittest. Instead evolution is about
reproduction, passing on copies of genes. An organism living centuries but not
reproducing is evolutionarily invisible.* The difference between survival and
reproduction is shown with “antagonistic pleiotropy,” referring to traits that
increase reproductive fitness early in life yet decrease life span. For example,
primates’ prostates have high metabolic rates, enhancing sperm motility. Upside:
enhanced fertility; downside: increased risk of prostate cancer. Antagonistic
pleiotropy occurs dramatically in salmon, who epically journey to their
spawning grounds to reproduce and then die. If evolution were about survival
rather than passing on copies of genes, there’d be no antagonistic pleiotropy.2
Another misconception is that evolution can select for preadaptations—
neutral traits that prove useful in the future. This doesn’t happen; selection is for
traits pertinent to the present. Related to this is the misconception that living
species are somehow better adapted than extinct species. Instead, the latter were
just as well adapted, until environmental conditions changed sufficiently to do
them in; the same awaits us. Finally, there’s the misconception that evolution
directionally selects for greater complexity. Yes, if once there were only single-
celled organisms and there are multicellular ones now, average complexity has
increased. Nonetheless, evolution doesn’t necessarily select for greater
complexity—just consider bacteria decimating humans with some plague.
The final misconception is that evolution is “just a theory.” I will boldly
assume that readers who have gotten this far believe in evolution. Opponents
inevitably bring up that irritating canard that evolution is unproven, because
(following an unuseful convention in the field) it is a “theory” (like, say, germ
theory). Evidence for the reality of evolution includes:
Numerous examples where changing selective pressures have
changed gene frequencies in populations within generations
(e.g., bacteria evolving antibiotic resistance). Moreover, there
are also examples (mostly insects, given their short generation
times) of a species in the process of splitting into two.
Voluminous fossil evidence of intermediate forms in numerous
taxonomic lineages.
Molecular evidence. We share ~98 percent of our genes with the
other apes, ~96 percent with monkeys, ~75 percent with dogs,
~20 percent with fruit flies. This indicates that our last common
ancestor with other apes lived more recently than our last
common ancestor with monkeys, and so on.
Geographic evidence. To use Richard Dawkins’s suggestion for
dealing with a fundamentalist insisting that all species emerged
in their current forms from Noah’s ark—how come all thirty-
seven species of lemurs that made landfall on Mt. Ararat in the
Armenian highlands hiked over to Madagascar, none dying and
leaving fossils in transit?
Unintelligent design—oddities explained only by evolution.
Why do whales and dolphins have vestigial leg bones? Because
they descend from a four-legged terrestrial mammal. Why
should we have arrector pili muscles in our skin that produce
thoroughly useless gooseflesh? Because of our recent speciation
from other apes whose arrector pili muscles were attached to
hair, and whose hair stands up during emotional arousal.
Enough. Don’t get me started.
—
Evolution sculpts the traits of an organism in two broad ways. “Sexual selection”
selects for traits that attract members of the opposite sex, “natural selection” for
traits that enhance the passing on of copies of genes through any other route—
e.g., good health, foraging skills, predator avoidance.
The two processes can work in opposition.3 For example, among wild sheep
one gene influences the size of horns in males. One variant produces large horns,
improving social dominance, a plus for sexual selection. The other produces
small horns, which are metabolically cheaper, allowing males to live and mate
(albeit at low rates) longer. Which wins—transient but major reproductive
success, or persistent but minor success? An intermediate form.* Or consider
male peacocks paying a price, in terms of natural selection, for their garish
plumage—it costs a fortune metabolically to grow, restricts mobility, and is
conspicuous to predators. But it sure boosts fitness via sexual selection.
Importantly, neither type of selection necessarily selects for “the” most
adaptive version of a trait, which replaces all others. There can be frequency-
dependent selection, where the rarer version of two traits is preferable, or
balanced selection, where multiple versions of traits are maintained in
equilibrium.
O
BEHAVIOR CAN BE SHAPED BY EVOLUTION
rganisms are amazingly well adapted. A desert rodent has kidneys that
excel at retaining water; a giraffe’s huge heart can pump blood up to its
brain; elephants’ leg bones are strong enough to support an elephant. Well, yes—
it has to work that way: desert rodents whose kidneys weren’t great at retaining
water didn’t pass on copies of their genes. Thus there is a logic to evolution,
where natural selection sculpts traits into adaptiveness.
Importantly, natural selection works not only on anatomy and physiology but
on behavior as well—in other words, behavior evolves, can be optimized by
selection into being adaptive.
Various branches of biology focus on the evolution of behavior. Probably
best known is sociobiology, premised on social behavior being sculpted by
evolution to be optimized, just as biomechanical optimization sculpts the size of
a giraffe’s heart.4 Sociobiology emerged in the 1970s, eventually generating the
offshoot evolutionary psychology—the study of the evolutionary optimization of
psychological traits; as we’ll see, both have been plenty controversial. As a
simplifying convenience, I’ll refer to people who study the evolution of social
behavior as “sociobiologists.”
W
THE DEMISE OF GROUP SELECTION
e start by grappling with an entrenched misconception about the
evolution of behavior. This is because Americans were taught about the
subject in the 1960s by Marlin Perkins on the TV program Mutual of Omaha’s
Wild Kingdom.
It was great. Perkins would host. Jim, his sidekick, did dangerous things with
snakes. And there were always seamless segues from the program to ads from
Mutual of Omaha—“Just as lions mate for hours, you’ll want fire insurance for
your home.”
Unfortunately, Perkins espoused wildly wrong evolutionary thinking. Here’s
how it looked on the program: It’s dawn on the savanna; there’s a herd of
wildebeest on a river’s edge. The grass is greener on the other side, and everyone
wants some, but the river teems with predatory crocodiles. The wildebeest are
hemming and hawing in agitation when suddenly an elderly wildebeest pushes to
the front, says, “I sacrifice myself for you, my children,” and leaps in. And while
the crocs are busy with him, the other wildebeest cross the river.
Why would the old wildebeest do that? Marlin Perkins would answer with
patrician authority: because animals behave For the Good of the Species.
Yes, behavior evolves by “group selection” for the good of the species. This
idea was championed in the early 1960s by V. C. Wynne-Edwards, whose
wrongness made him modern evolutionary biology’s Lamarck.*5
Animals don’t behave for the good of the species. But what about that
wildebeest? Look closely and you’ll see what really happens. Why did he wind
up saving the day? Because he was old and weak. “Good of the species” my
keister. They pushed the old guy in.
Group selection was done in by theoretical and empirical studies showing
patterns of behavior incompatible with it. Key work was done by two gods of
evolutionary biology, George Williams of SUNY Stony Brook and Oxford’s Bill
(“W.D.”) Hamilton.6 Consider “eusocial insects,” where most individuals are
nonreproductive workers. Why forgo reproduction to aid the queen? Group
selection, obviously. Hamilton showed that eusocial insects’ unique genetic
system makes a colony of ants, bees, or termites a single superorganism; asking
why worker ants forgo reproduction is like asking why your nose cells forgo
reproduction. In other words, eusocial insects constitute a unique type of
“group.” Williams then elaborated on how the more standard genetic system, in
species from noneusocial insects to us, was incompatible with group selection.
Animals don’t behave for the good of the species. They behave to maximize the
number of copies of their genes passed into the next generation.*
This is the cornerstone of sociobiology and was summarized in Dawkins’s
famed sound bite that evolution is about “selfish genes.” Time to see its building
blocks.
P
INDIVIDUAL SELECTION
assing on lots of copies of one’s genes is accomplished most directly by
maximizing reproduction. This is summarized by the aphorism “A chicken
is an egg’s way of making another egg”—behavior is just an epiphenomenon, a
means of getting copies of genes into the next generation.
Individual selection fares better than group selection in explaining basic
behaviors. A hyena bears down on some zebras. What would the nearest one do
if she’s a group selectionist? Stand there, sacrificing herself for the group. In
contrast, an individual selectionist zebra would run like hell. Zebras run like hell.
Or consider hyenas that have just killed a zebra. Group selection mind-set—
everyone calmly takes turns eating. Individual selection—frenzied free-for-all.
Which is what occurs.
But wait, says the group selectionist, wouldn’t the zebra species benefit if it
is the fastest animals who survive and pass on those fast-running genes? Ditto
for the group benefits of the fiercest hyena getting the most food.
As more nuances of behavior are observed, clinging to group selection
requires increasingly tortuous arguments. But one single observation devastates
group selection.
In 1977 the Harvard primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy documented
something remarkable—langur monkeys in the Mount Abu region of India kill
one another.7 People already knew that some male primates kill one another,
fighting for dominance—okay, makes sense, boys will be boys. But that’s not
what Hrdy reported; male langurs were killing infants.
Once people believed her careful documentation, there was an easy answer
—since babies are cute and inhibit aggression, something pathological must be
happening.8 Maybe the Abu langur population density was too high and
everyone was starving, or male aggression was overflowing, or infanticidal
males were zombies. Something certifiably abnormal.
Hrdy eliminated these explanations and showed a telling pattern to the
infanticide. Female langurs live in groups with a single resident breeding male.
Elsewhere are all-male groups that intermittently drive out the resident male;
after infighting, one male then drives out the rest. Here’s his new domain,
consisting of females with the babies of the previous male. And crucially, the
average tenure of a breeding male (about twenty-seven months) is shorter than
the average interbirth interval. No females are ovulating, because they’re nursing
infants; thus this new stud will be booted out himself before any females wean
their kids and resume ovulating. All for nothing, none of his genes passed on.
What, logically, should he do? Kill the infants. This decreases the
reproductive success of the previous male and, thanks to the females ceasing to
nurse, they start ovulating.*
That’s the male perspective. What about the females? They’re also into
maximizing copies of genes passed on. They fight the new male, protecting their
infants. Females have also evolved the strategy of going into “pseudoestrus”—
falsely appearing to be in heat. They mate with the male. And since males know
squat about female langur biology, they fall for it—“Hey, I mated with her this
morning and now she’s got an infant; I am one major stud.” They’ll often cease
their infanticidal attacks.
Despite initial skepticism, competitive infanticide has been documented in
similar circumstances in 119 species, including lions, hippos, and chimps.9
A variant occurs in hamsters; because males are nomadic, any infant a male
encounters is unlikely to be his, and thus he attempts to kill it (remember that
rule about never putting a pet male hamster in a cage with babies?). Another
version occurs among wild horses and gelada baboons; a new male harasses
pregnant females into miscarrying. Or suppose you’re a pregnant mouse and a
new, infanticidal male has arrived. Once you give birth, your infants will be
killed, wasting all the energy of pregnancy. Logical response? Cut your losses
with the “Bruce effect,” where pregnant females miscarry if they smell a new
male.10
Thus competitive infanticide occurs in numerous species (including among
female chimps, who sometimes kill infants of unrelated females).11 None of this
makes sense outside of gene-based individual selection.
Individual selection is shown with heartbreaking clarity by mountain
gorillas, my favorite primate.12 They’re highly endangered, hanging on in
pockets of high-altitude rain forest on the borders of Uganda, Rwanda, and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are only about a thousand gorillas left,
because of habitat degradation, disease caught from nearby humans, poaching,
and spasms of warfare rolling across those borders. And also because mountain
gorillas practice competitive infanticide. Logical for an individual intent on
maximizing the copies of his genes in the next generation, but simultaneously
pushing these wondrous animals toward extinction. This isn’t behaving for the
good of the species.
T
KIN SELECTION
o understand the next foundational concept, reflect on what it means to be
related to someone and to pass on copies of “your” genes.
Suppose you have an identical twin, with the same genome as you. As a
startling, irrefutable fact, in terms of the genes being passed on to the next
generation, it doesn’t matter if you reproduce or sacrifice yourself so that your
twin reproduces.
What about a full sibling who isn’t an identical twin? Recall from chapter 8
that you’d share 50 percent of your genes with him.* Thus reproducing once and
dying so that he reproduces twice are evolutionarily identical. Half sibling, 25
percent of genes in common, calculate accordingly. . . .
The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane, who, when asked if he’d sacrifice his life for
a brother, is credited to have quipped, “I’ll gladly lay down my life for two
brothers or eight cousins.” You can leave copies of your genes in the next
generation by reproducing, but also by helping relatives reproduce, especially
closer relatives. Hamilton formalized this with an equation factoring in the costs
and benefits of helping someone, weighted by their degree of relatedness to you.
This is the essence of kin selection.* This explains the crucial fact that in
countless species, whom you cooperate with, compete with, or mate with
depends on their degree of relatedness to you.
Mammals first encounter kin selection soon after birth, reflecting something
monumentally obvious: females rarely nurse someone else’s infants. Next,
among numerous primates the mother of a newborn and an adolescent female
may commence a relationship fraught with pluses and minuses—the mother
occasionally lets the adolescent care for her offspring. For the mother the plus is
getting time to forage without baby on board; the minus is that the babysitter
may be incompetent. For the adolescent the plus is getting mothering experience;
the minus, the effort of child care. Lynn Fairbanks of UCLA has quantified the
pluses and minuses of such “allomothering” (including that adolescents who
practiced mothering have a better survival rate for their own kids). And who is a
frequent “allomother”? The female’s kid sister.13
An extension of allomothering is the cooperative breeding of New World
monkeys like marmosets. In their social groups only one female breeds, while
the others—typically younger relatives—help with child care.14
The extent to which a male primate cares for infants reflects his certainty of
paternity.15 Among marmosets, who form stable pair-bonds, males do most of
the child care. In contrast, among baboons, where a female mates with multiple
males during her estrus cycle, it’s only the likely fathers (i.e., males who mated
on the female’s most fertile day, when she had her most conspicuous estrus
swelling) who invest in the well-being of the child, aiding him in a fight.*
Among many primates, how often you groom someone depends on how
closely related they are to you. Among baboons, females spend their whole life
in their natal troop (whereas males migrate to a new troop at puberty); as a
result, adult females have complex cooperative kinship relations and inherit their
dominance rank from their mother. Among chimps it’s the opposite; females
leave home at puberty, and kin-based adult cooperation occurs only among
males (for example, where groups of related males attack solitary males from
neighboring groups). And among langurs, when a female defends her infant
against a new male, she most often is helped by elderly female relatives.
Moreover, primates understand kinship. Dorothy Cheney and Robert
Seyfarth of the University of Pennsylvania, studying wild vervet monkeys, have
shown that if animal A is crummy to animal B, afterward, B is more likely to be
crummy to A’s relatives. And if A is lousy to B, B’s relatives are more likely to
be crummy to A. Furthermore, if A is lousy to B, B’s relatives are more likely to
be crummy to A’s relatives.16
In beautiful “playback” experiments, Cheney and Seyfarth first recorded
vocalizations from each vervet in a group. They’d place a speaker in some
bushes, and when everyone was sitting around, they’d play a recording of some
kid giving a distress call. And the females would all look at the kid’s mother
—“Hey, that’s Madge’s kid. What’s she going to do?” (Note that this also shows
that monkeys recognize voices.)
In a study of wild baboons, Cheney and Seyfarth would wait for two
unrelated females to sit near the bush with the speaker and then play one of three
vocalizations: (a) sounds of the two females’ relatives fighting with each other;
(b) a relative of one fighting with a third party; (c) two other random females
fighting.17 If a female’s relative was involved in the fighting, she’d look toward
the speaker longer than if there were no relatives involved. And if it was
relatives of the two females fighting each other, the higher-ranking one would
remind the subordinate of her place by supplanting her from her spot.
Another playback study created some baboon virtual reality.18 Baboon A
dominates baboon B. Thanks to cutting and splicing of recordings of
vocalizations, baboon A is heard making a dominance vocalization, B making a
subordination one. When this happens, no baboons looked at the bushes—A > B,
boring status quo. But if baboon A is heard making a subordination vocalization
after B makes a dominance one—a rank reversal—everyone orients to the
bushes (“Did you hear what I just heard?”). Then a third scenario—a dominance
reversal between
