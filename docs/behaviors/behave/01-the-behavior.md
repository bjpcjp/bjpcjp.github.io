The Behavior
e have our strategy in place. A behavior has occurred—one that is
reprehensible, or wonderful, or floating ambiguously in between. What
occurred in the prior second that triggered the behavior? This is the province of
the nervous system. What occurred in the prior seconds to minutes that triggered
the nervous system to produce that behavior? This is the world of sensory
stimuli, much of it sensed unconsciously. What occurred in the prior hours to
days to change the sensitivity of the nervous system to such stimuli? Acute
actions of hormones. And so on, all the way back to the evolutionary pressures
played out over the prior millions of years that started the ball rolling.
So we’re set. Except that when approaching this big sprawling mess of a
subject, it is kind of incumbent upon you to first define your terms. Which is an
unwelcome prospect.
Here are some words of central importance to this book: aggression,
violence, compassion, empathy, sympathy, competition, cooperation, altruism,
envy, schadenfreude, spite, forgiveness, reconciliation, revenge, reciprocity, and
(why not?) love. Flinging us into definitional quagmires.
Why the difficulty? As emphasized in the introduction, one reason is that so
many of these terms are the subject of ideological battles over the appropriation
and distortions of their meanings.*1 Words pack power and these definitions are
laden with values, often wildly idiosyncratic ones. Here’s an example, namely
the ways I think about the word “competition”: (a) “competition”—your lab
team races the Cambridge group to a discovery (exhilarating but embarrassing to
admit to); (b) “competition”—playing pickup soccer (fine, as long as the best
player shifts sides if the score becomes lopsided); (c) “competition”—your
child’s teacher announces a prize for the best outlining-your-fingers
Thanksgiving turkey drawing (silly and perhaps a red flag—if it keeps
happening, maybe complain to the principal); (d) “competition”—whose deity is
more worth killing for? (try to avoid).
But the biggest reason for the definitional challenge was emphasized in the
introduction—these terms mean different things to scientists living inside
different disciplines. Is “aggression” about thought, emotion, or something done
with muscles? Is “altruism” something that can be studied mathematically in
various species, including bacteria, or are we discussing moral development in
kids? And implicit in these different perspectives, disciplines have differing
tendencies toward lumping and splitting—these scientists believe that behavior
X consists of two different subtypes, whereas those scientists think it comes in
seventeen flavors.
Let’s examine this with respect to different types of “aggression.”2 Animal
behaviorists dichotomize between offensive and defensive aggression,
distinguishing between, say, the intruder and the resident of a territory; the
biology underlying these two versions differs. Such scientists also distinguish
between conspecific aggression (between members of the same species) and
fighting off a predator. Meanwhile, criminologists distinguish between impulsive
and premeditated aggression. Anthropologists care about differing levels of
organization underlying aggression, distinguishing among warfare, clan
vendettas, and homicide.
Moreover, various disciplines distinguish between aggression that occurs
reactively (in response to provocation) and spontaneous aggression, as well as
between hot-blooded, emotional aggression and cold-blooded, instrumental
aggression (e.g., “I want your spot to build my nest, so scram or I’ll peck your
eyes out; this isn’t personal, though”).3 Then there’s another version of “This
isn’t personal”—targeting someone just because they’re weak and you’re
frustrated, stressed, or pained and need to displace some aggression. Such third-
party aggression is ubiquitous—shock a rat and it’s likely to bite the smaller guy
nearby; a beta-ranking male baboon loses a fight to the alpha, and he chases the
omega male;* when unemployment rises, so do rates of domestic violence.
Depressingly, as will be discussed in chapter 4, displacement aggression can
decrease the perpetrator’s stress hormone levels; giving ulcers can help you
avoid getting them. And of course there is the ghastly world of aggression that is
neither reactive nor instrumental but is done for pleasure.
Then there are specialized subtypes of aggression—maternal aggression,
which often has a distinctive endocrinology. There’s the difference between
aggression and ritualistic threats of aggression. For example, many primates
have lower rates of actual aggression than of ritualized threats (such as
displaying their canines). Similarly, aggression in Siamese fighting fish is mostly
ritualistic.*
Getting a definitional handle on the more positive terms isn’t easy either.
There’s empathy versus sympathy, reconciliation versus forgiveness, and
altruism versus “pathological altruism.”4 For a psychologist the last term might
describe the empathic codependency of enabling a partner’s drug use. For a
neuroscientist it describes a consequence of a type of damage to the frontal
cortex—in economic games of shifting strategies, individuals with such damage
fail to switch to less altruistic play when being repeatedly stabbed in the back by
the other player, despite being able to verbalize the other player’s strategy.
When it comes to the more positive behaviors, the most pervasive issue is
one that ultimately transcends semantics—does pure altruism actually exist? Can
you ever separate doing good from the expectation of reciprocity, public acclaim,
self-esteem, or the promise of paradise?
This plays out in a fascinating realm, as reported in Larissa MacFarquhar’s
2009 New Yorker piece “The Kindest Cut.”5 It concerns people who donate
organs not to family members or close friends but to strangers. An act of
seemingly pure altruism. But these Samaritans unnerve everyone, sowing
suspicion and skepticism. Is she expecting to get paid secretly for her kidney? Is
she that desperate for attention? Will she work her way into the recipient’s life
and do a Fatal Attraction? What’s her deal? The piece suggests that these
profound acts of goodness unnerve because of their detached, affectless nature.
This speaks to an important point that runs through the book. As noted, we
distinguish between hot-blooded and cold-blooded violence. We understand the
former more, can see mitigating factors in it—consider the grieving, raging man
who kills the killer of his child. And conversely, affectless violence seems
horrifying and incomprehensible; this is the sociopathic contract killer, the
Hannibal Lecter who kills without his heart rate nudging up a beat.*6 It’s why
cold-blooded killing is a damning descriptor.
Similarly, we expect that our best, most prosocial acts be warmhearted, filled
with positive affect. Cold-blooded goodness seems oxymoronic, is unsettling. I
was once at a conference of neuroscientists and all-star Buddhist monk
meditators, the former studying what the brains of the latter did during
meditation. One scientist asked one of the monks whether he ever stops
meditating because his knees hurt from all that cross-leggedness. He answered,
“Sometimes I’ll stop sooner than I planned, but not because it hurts; it’s not
something I notice. It’s as an act of kindness to my knees.” “Whoa,” I thought,
“these guys are from another planet.” A cool, commendable one, but another
planet nonetheless. Crimes of passion and good acts of passion make the most
sense to us (nevertheless, as we shall see, dispassionate kindness often has much
to recommend it).
Hot-blooded badness, warmhearted goodness, and the unnerving incongruity
of the cold-blooded versions raise a key point, encapsulated in a quote from Elie
Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and concentration camp survivor: “The
opposite of love is not hate; its opposite is indifference.” The biologies of strong
love and strong hate are similar in many ways, as we’ll see.
Which reminds us that we don’t hate aggression; we hate the wrong kind of
aggression but love it in the right context. And conversely, in the wrong context
our most laudable behaviors are anything but. The motoric features of our
behaviors are less important and challenging to understand than the meaning
behind our muscles’ actions.
This is shown in a subtle study.7 Subjects in a brain scanner entered a virtual
room where they encountered either an injured person in need of help or a
menacing extraterrestrial; subjects could either bandage or shoot the individual.
Pulling a trigger and applying a bandage are different behaviors. But they are
similar, insofar as bandaging the injured person and shooting the alien are both
the “right” things. And contemplating those two different versions of doing the
right thing activated the same circuitry in the most context-savvy part of the
brain, the prefrontal cortex.
And thus those key terms that anchor this book are most difficult to define
because of their profound context dependency. I will therefore group them in a
way that reflects this. I won’t frame the behaviors to come as either pro- or
antisocial—too cold-blooded for my expository tastes. Nor will they be labeled
as “good” and “evil”—too hot-blooded and frothy. Instead, as our convenient
shorthand for concepts that truly defy brevity, this book is about the biology of
our best and worst behaviors.
