War and Peace
et’s review some facts. The amygdala typically activates when seeing a
face of another race. If you’re poor, by the time you’re five, your frontal
cortical development probably lags behind average. Oxytocin makes us crappy
to strangers. Empathy doesn’t particularly translate into compassionate acts, nor
does refined moral development translate into doing the harder, right thing.
There are gene variants that, in particular settings, make you prone toward
antisocial acts. And bonobos aren’t perfectly peaceful—they wouldn’t be
masters of reconciliation if they didn’t have conflicts to reconcile.
All this makes one mighty pessimistic. Yet the rationale for this book is that,
nonetheless, there’s ground for optimism.
Thus this final chapter’s goals are (a) to evidence that things have improved,
that many of our worst behaviors are in retreat, our best ones ascendant; (b) to
examine ways to improve this further; (c) to derive emotional support for this
venture, to see that our best behaviors can occur in the most unlikely
circumstances; (d) and finally, to see if I can actually get away with calling this
chapter “War and Peace.”

SOMEWHAT BETTER ANGELS
hen it comes to our best and worst behaviors, the world is astonishingly
different from that of the not-so-distant past. At the dawn of the
nineteenth century, slavery occurred worldwide, including in the colonies of a
Europe basking in the Enlightenment. Child labor was universal and would soon
reach its exploitative golden age with the Industrial Revolution. And there
wasn’t a country that punished mistreatment of animals. Now every nation has
outlawed slavery, and most attempt to enforce that; most have child labor laws,
rates of child labor have declined, and it increasingly consists of children
working alongside their parents in their homes; most countries regulate the
treatment of animals in some manner.
The world is also safer. Fifteenth-century Europe averaged 41 homicides per
100,000 people per year. Currently only El Salvador, Venezuela, and Honduras,
at 62, 64, and 85, respectively, are worse; the world averages 6.9, Europe
averages 1.4, and there are Iceland, Japan, and Singapore at 0.3.
Here are things that are rarer in recent centuries: Forced marriages, child
brides, genital mutilation, wife beating, polygamy, widow burning. Persecution
of homosexuals, epileptics, albinos. Beating of schoolchildren, beating of beasts
of burden. Rule of a land by an occupying army, by a colonial overlord, by an
unelected dictator. Illiteracy, death in infancy, death in childbirth, death from
preventable disease. Capital punishment.
Here are things invented in the last century: Bans on the use of certain types
of weapons. The World Court and the concept of crimes against humanity. The
UN and the dispatching of multinational peacekeeping forces. International
agreements to hinder trafficking of blood diamonds, elephant tusks, rhino horns,
leopard skins, and humans. Agencies that collect money to aid disaster victims
anywhere on the planet, that facilitate intercontinental adoption of orphans, that
battle global pandemics and send medical personnel to any place of conflict.
Yes, I know, I’m an utter naïf if I think laws are universally enforced. For
example, in 1981 Mauritania became the last country to ban slavery;
nevertheless, today roughly 20 percent of its people are slaves, and the
government has prosecuted a total of one slave owner.1 I recognize that little has
changed in many places; I have spent decades in Africa living around people
who believe that epileptics are possessed and that the organs of murdered albinos
have healing powers, where beating of wives, children, and animals is the norm,
five-year-olds herd cattle and haul firewood, pubescent girls are
clitoridectomized and given to old men as third wives. Nonetheless, worldwide,
things have improved.
The definitive account of this is Pinker’s monumental The Better Angels of
Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.2 It’s a scholarly work that’s gut-
wrenchingly effective in documenting just how bad things once were. Pinker
graphically describes the appalling historical inhumanity of humans. Roughly
half a million people died in the Roman Colosseum to supply audiences of tens
of thousands the pleasure of watching captives raped, dismembered, tortured,
eaten by animals. Throughout the Middle Ages, armies swept across Eurasia,
destroying villages, killing every man, consigning every woman and child to
slavery. Aristocracy accounted for a disproportionate share of violence, savaging
peasantry with impunity. Religious and governmental authorities, ranging from
Europeans to Persians, Chinese, Hindus, Polynesians, Aztecs, Africans, and
Native Americans, invented means of torture. For a bored sixteenth-century
Parisian, entertainment might consist of a cat burning, execution of a “criminal”
animal, or bearbaiting, where a bear, chained to a post, would be torn apart by
dogs. It is a sickeningly different world; Pinker quotes the writer L. P. Hartley:
“The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.”
Better Angels has provoked three controversies:
Why Were People So Awful Then?
For Pinker the answer is clear. Because people had always been so awful.
This is chapter 9’s debate—when was war invented, was ancestral hunter-
gatherer life about Hobbes or Rousseau? As we saw, Pinker is in the camp
holding that organized human violence predates civilization, stretching back to
our last common ancestor with chimps. And as reviewed, most experts
convincingly disagree, suggesting that data have been cherry-picked, hunter-
horticulturalists mislabeled as hunter-gatherers, and newfangled sedentary
hunter-gatherers inappropriately grouped with traditional nomadic ones.
Why Have People Gotten Less Awful?
Pinker’s answer reflects two factors. He draws on the sociologist Norbert
Elias, whose notion of the “civilizing process” centered on the fact that violence
declines when states monopolize force. That is coupled with spread of commerce
and trade, fostering realpolitik self-restraint—recognizing that it’s better to have
this other person alive and trading with you. Their well-being begins to matter,
prompting what Pinker calls an “escalator of reasoning”—an enlarged capacity
for empathy and Us-ness. This underlies the “rights revolution”—civil rights,
women’s rights, children’s rights, gay rights, animal rights. This view is a
triumph of cognition. Pinker yokes this to the “Flynn effect,” the well-
documented increase in average IQ over the last century; he invokes a moral
Flynn effect, as increasing intelligence and respect for reasoning fuel better
Theory of Mind and perspective taking and an increased ability to appreciate the
long-term advantages of peace. In the words of one reviewer, Pinker is “not too
fainthearted to call his own culture civilized.”3
Predictably, this has drawn fire from all sides. The Left charges that this
giddy overvaluing of the dead-white-male Enlightenment fuels Western
neoimperialism.4 My personal political instincts run in this direction.
Nonetheless, one must admit that the countries with minimal violence, extensive
social safety nets, few child brides, numerous female legislators, and sacrosanct
civil liberties are usually direct cultural descendants of the Enlightenment.
Meanwhile, the Right claims that Pinker ignores religion, pretending that
decency was invented in the Enlightenment.5 He is eloquently unapologetic
about this—for him much of what has gone right reflects people’s “shifting from
valuing souls to valuing lives.” For others the criticism is that this escalator of
reasoning fetishizes cognition over affect—after all, sociopaths have great
Theory of Mind, a (damage-induced) purely rational mind makes abhorrent
moral judgments, and a sense of justice is fueled by the amygdala and insula, not
the dlPFC. Obviously, this many pages into the book, I feel that the interaction of
reasoning and feeling is key.
Have People Really Gotten Less Awful?
This has been very contentious. Pinker offers the sound bite “We may be
living in the most peaceful era in our species’ existence.” The fact most driving
this optimism is that, except for the Balkan wars, Europe has been at peace since
1945, the longest stretch in history. For Pinker, this “Long Peace” represents the
West coming to its senses after the ruin of World War II, seeing how the
advantages of being a common market outweigh those of being a perpetually
warring continent, plus some expanding empathy thrown in on the side.
Critics characterize this as Eurocentrism. Western countries may kumbaya
one another, but they’ve sure made war elsewhere—France in Indochina and
Algeria, Britain in Malaya and Kenya, Portugal in Angola and Mozambique, the
USSR in Afghanistan, the United States in Vietnam, Korea, and Latin America.
Moreover, parts of the developing world have been continuously at war for
decades—consider the eastern Congo. Most important, such wars have been
made bloodier because the West invented the idea of having client states fight
proxy wars for them. After all, the late twentieth century saw the United States
and USSR arm the warring Somalia and Ethiopia, only to switch to arming the
other side within a few years. The Long Peace has been for Westerners.
The claim of violence declining steadily over the last millennium also must
accommodate the entire bloody twentieth century. World War II killed 55 million
people, more than any conflict in history. Throw in World War I, Stalin, Mao,
and the Russian and Chinese civil wars, and you’re up to 130 million.
Pinker does something sensible that reflects his being a scientist. He corrects
for total population size. Thus, while the eighth century’s An Lushan Rebellion
and civil war in Tang dynasty China killed “only” 36 million, that represented
one sixth of the world’s population—the equivalent of 429 million in the
midtwentieth century. When deaths are expressed as a percentage of total
population, World War II is the only twentieth-century event cracking the top
ten, behind An Lushan, the Mongol conquests, the Mideast slave trade, the fall
of the Ming dynasty, the fall of Rome, the deaths caused by Tamerlane, the
annihilation of Native Americans by Europeans, and the Atlantic slave trade.
Critics have questioned this—“Hey, stop using fudge factors to somehow
make World War II’s 55 million dead less than the fall of Rome’s 8 million.”
After all, 9/11’s murders would not have evoked only half as much terror if
America had 600 million instead of 300 million citizens. But Pinker’s analysis is
appropriate, and analyzing rates of events is how you discover that today’s
London is much safer than was Dickens’s or that some hunter-gatherer groups
have homicide rates that match Detroit’s.
But Pinker failed to take things one logical step further—also correcting for
differing durations of events. Thus he compares the half dozen years of World
War II with, for example, twelve centuries of the Mideast slave trade and four
centuries of Native American genocide. When corrected for duration as well as
total world population, the top ten now include World War II (number one),
World War I (number three), the Russian Civil War (number eight), Mao
(number ten), and an event that didn’t even make Pinker’s original list, the
Rwandan genocide (number seven), where 700,000 people were killed in a
hundred days.*
This suggests both good and bad news. Compared with the past, we are
extraordinarily different in terms of whom we extend rights to and feel empathy
for and what global ills we counter. And things are better in terms of fewer
people acting violently and societies attempting to contain them. But the bad
news is that the reach of the violent few is ever greater. They don’t just rage
about events on another continent—they travel there and wreak havoc. The
charismatically violent inspire thousands in chat rooms instead of a mob in their
village. Like-minded lone wolves more readily meet and metastasize. And the
chaos once let loose with a cudgel or machete occurs now with an automatic
weapon or bomb, with far more horrific consequences. Things have improved.
But that doesn’t mean they’re good.
Thus we now consider insights provided by this book that might help.
F
SOME TRADITIONAL ROUTES
irst there’s the strategy for reducing violence that stretches back tens of
thousands of years—moving. If two individuals in a hunter-gatherer band
are having tensions, one frequently shifts to a neighboring band, sometimes
voluntarily, sometimes not. Similarly, interband tensions are reduced when one
shifts to a different location, an advantage of nomadicism. A recent study of the
hunter-gathering Hadza of Tanzania showed an additional benefit to this fluidity
straight out of chapter 10. Specifically, it facilitates highly cooperative
individuals associating with one another.6
Then there are the beneficial effects of trade, as emphasized by
anthropologists, as well as Pinker. From trading at a village market to signing
international trade agreements, it is often true that where goods do not pass
frontiers, armies will. It’s a version of Thomas Friedman’s somewhat tongue-in-
cheek Golden Arches Theory of peace—countries with McDonald’s don’t fight
one another. While there are exceptions (e.g., the U.S. invasion of Panama, the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon), Friedman’s broad point holds—countries that are
sufficiently stable that they are integrated into global markets with the likes of
McDonald’s and prosperous enough that their people keep those establishments
in business likely conclude that the trade advantages of peace outweigh the
imagined spoils of war.**7
This isn’t surefire—for example, despite being major trading partners,
Germany and the UK fought World War I—and there’s no shortage of people
willing to go to war, even at the cost of disrupted trade and scarce commodities.
Moreover, “trade” is double-edged. It’s certifiably groovy when occurring
between indigenous rain forest hunters; it’s certifiably vile if you’re protesting
the WTO. But as long as countries can wage war on distant nations, long-
distance trade that makes them interdependent is a good deterrent.
Cultural diffusion in general (which includes trade) can also facilitate peace.
This can have a modern tint—across 189 countries, digital access predicts
increased civil liberties and media freedom. Moreover, the more civil liberties in
a neighboring country, the stronger this effect, as ideas flow with goods.8
Religion
Well, I’d love to skip this section, but I can’t. That’s because religion is
arguably our most defining cultural invention, an incredibly powerful catalyst for
both our best and worst behaviors.
When introducing the pituitary in chapter 4, I didn’t feel obliged to first
disclose my feelings about the gland. But the equivalent feels appropriate here.
Thus: I was raised highly observant and Orthodox, felt intensely religious. But
then, around age thirteen, the whole edifice collapsed; ever since, I’ve been
incapable of any religiosity or spirituality and more readily focus on religion’s
destructive than its beneficial aspects. But I like being around religious people
and am moved by them—while baffled by how they can believe that stuff. And I
fervently wish that I could. The end.
As emphasized in chapter 9, we’ve created a staggering variety of religions.
In considering solely religions with worldwide reaches, there are some important
commonalities:
a. They all involve facets of religiosity that are intensely personal,
solitary, and individualized, as well as facets that are about
community; as we’ll see, these are very different realms when it
comes to fostering our best and worst behaviors.
b. All involve personal and communal ritualized behaviors that
comfort in times of anxiety; however, many of those anxieties
were created by the religion itself.
The anxiety-reducing effects of belief are logical, given
that psychological stress is about lack of control,
predictability, outlets, and social support. Depending on the
religion, belief brings an explanation for why things happen,
a conviction that there is a purpose, and the sense of a
creator who is interested in us, who is benevolent, who
responds to human entreaties, who preferentially responds
to entreaties from people like you. No wonder religiosity
has health benefits (independent of the community support
that it brings and the decreased rates of substance abuse).
Recall the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in
sounding an alarm when there is a discrepancy between how
you thought things worked and how they actually do. After
controlling for personality and cognitive abilities, more
religious people show less ACC activation when getting
news of a negative discrepancy. Other studies show the
anxiety-reducing effects of repetitive religious rituals.9
c. Finally, all the world religions distinguish between Us and
Them, though they differ as to what is required to be an Us and
whether the pertinent attributes are immutable.
Enough is known about the neurobiology of religiosity that there’s even a
journal called Religion, Brain and Behavior. Reciting a familiar prayer activates
mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. Improvising one activates regions associated
with Theory of Mind, as you try to understand a deity’s perspective (“God wants
me to be humble in addition to grateful; better make sure I mention that”).
Moreover, more activation of this Theory of Mind network correlates with a
more personified image of a deity. Believing that someone is faith healing
deactivates the (cognitive) dlPFC, suspending disbelief. And performing a
familiar ritual activates cortical regions associated with habit and reflexive
evaluation.10
So are religious people nicer than nonreligious ones? It depends on whether
they’re interacting with in- or out-group members. Okay, are religious people
nicer to in-group members? Numerous studies say yes—more volunteering (with
or without a religious context), charitable giving, and spontaneous prosociality,
more generosity, trust, honesty, and forgiveness in economic games. However,
numerous studies show no differences.11
Why the discrepancy? For starters, it matters whether data are self-reported
—religious people tend to inflate reports of their prosociality more than do
nonreligious people. Another factor is whether the prosociality is public—
conspicuous display is particularly important to those religious people who
strongly need social approval. As more context dependency, in one study
religious people were more charitable than nonreligious ones—but only on their
Sabbath.12
Another important issue: what kind of religion? As introduced in chapter 9,
Ara Norenzayan, Azim Shariff, and Joseph Henrich of the University of British
Columbia have identified links between features of various religions and aspects
of prosociality.13 As we saw, small-band cultures (such as hunter-gatherers)
rarely invent moralizing deities. It is not until cultures are large enough that
people regularly interact anonymously with strangers that it becomes
commonplace to invent a judgmental god—the Judeo-Christian/Muslim deity.
In such cultures overt and subliminal religious cues boost prosociality. In one
study religious subjects unscrambled sentences that did or didn’t contain
religious terms (e.g., spirit, divine, sacred); doing the former prompted
generosity afterward. This is reminiscent of chapter 3’s finding that merely
seeing a pair of eyes posted on a wall makes people more prosocial. And
showing that this is about being monitored, unscrambling sentences with secular
terms such as “jury,” “police,” or “contract” had the same effect.14
Thus reminders of a judgmental god(s) boosts prosociality. It also matters
what that deity does about transgressions. Within and among cultures, the more
punitive the god, the more generosity to an anonymous coreligion
