Acknowledgments
The naturalist Edward O. Wilson, one of the most influential thinkers of our
time, has found himself at the center of fiery controversies related to the
evolution of human social behavior (discussed in chapter 10). An elegant and
graceful man, he has written about those disputes and those who have most
strongly opposed him—“Without a trace of irony I can say I have been blessed
with brilliant enemies. I owe them a great debt, because they redoubled my
energies and drove me in new directions.”
When it comes to this book, I count myself even luckier than Wilson, in that
I’ve had the good fortune of brilliant friends, ones who have been enormously
helpful and generous with their time in vetting the chapters of this book. They’ve
flagged my errors of omission and commission and my under-, over-, and
misinterpretations, and tactfully let me know areas where I was twenty years out
of date in my knowledge, or just plain woefully wrong. This book has benefited
enormously from their collegial kindness, and I thank them all deeply (while
taking credit for any errors remaining). They are:

I have also had the fortune to interact with the spectacular students at
Stanford University, and a number of them have directly contributed to this
book. This has taken the form of their being library assistants, helping out with
specific topics, or being members of a small seminar that I taught a few times
that focused on the content of this book. They’ve been wonderful to work with
and learn from. They are:

I also thank Lisa Pereira of Stanford University, Christopher Richards of
Penguin Books, Thea Traff of the New Yorker, and Ethan Lipka of the Nueva
School for helping tremendously in getting this book into shape during the final
stretch. Thanks to Kevin Berger for thinking of the title to chapter 6. Warm,
heartfelt thanks to Katinka Matson and Steven Barclay, my publishing and
speaking agents, sounding boards, and friends—you both know how long and
difficult the gestation of this book was, and thank you for sticking with me
throughout. I thank Scott Moyers of Penguin with huge gratitude—you have
been a dream of an editor. And I apologize to anyone whose support I have
missed noting here, as I rush frantically to meet the deadline for this book. . . .
Finally, above all else, I thank and madly love those who have given the
most support, and who have withstood the most interruptions of board games,
while I worked on the book—my family.
