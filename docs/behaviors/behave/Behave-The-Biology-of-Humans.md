Introduction
he fantasy always runs like this: A team of us has fought our way into his
secret bunker. Okay, it’s a fantasy, let’s go whole hog. I’ve single-
handedly neutralized his elite guard and have burst into his bunker, my
Browning machine gun at the ready. He lunges for his Luger; I knock it out of
his hand. He lunges for the cyanide pill he keeps to commit suicide rather than
be captured. I knock that out of his hand as well. He snarls in rage, attacks with
otherworldly strength. We grapple; I manage to gain the upper hand and pin him
down and handcuff him. “Adolf Hitler,” I announce, “I arrest you for crimes
against humanity.”
And this is where the medal-of-honor version of the fantasy ends and the
imagery darkens. What would I do with Hitler? The viscera become so raw that I
switch to passive voice in my mind, to get some distance. What should be done
with Hitler? It’s easy to imagine, once I allow myself. Sever his spine at the
neck, leave him paralyzed but with sensation. Take out his eyes with a blunt
instrument. Puncture his eardrums, rip out his tongue. Keep him alive, tube-fed,
on a respirator. Immobile, unable to speak, to see, to hear, only able to feel. Then
inject him with something that will give him a cancer that festers and pustulates
in every corner of his body, that will grow and grow until every one of his cells
shrieks with agony, till every moment feels like an infinity spent in the fires of
hell. That’s what should be done with Hitler. That’s what I would want done to
Hitler. That’s what I would do to Hitler.
—
I’ve had versions of this fantasy since I was a kid. Still do at times. And when I
really immerse myself in it, my heart rate quickens, I flush, my fists clench. All
those plans for Hitler, the most evil person in history, the soul most deserving of
punishment.
But there is a big problem. I don’t believe in souls or evil, think that the word
“wicked” is most pertinent to a musical, and doubt that punishment should be
relevant to criminal justice. But there’s a problem with that, in turn—I sure feel
like some people should be put to death, yet I oppose the death penalty. I’ve
enjoyed plenty of violent, schlocky movies, despite being in favor of strict gun
control. And I sure had fun when, at some kid’s birthday party and against
various unformed principles in my mind, I played laser tag, shooting at strangers
from hiding places (fun, that is, until some pimply kid zapped me, like, a million
times and then snickered at me, which made me feel insecure and unmanly). Yet
at the same time, I know most of the lyrics to “Down by the Riverside” (“ain’t
gonna study war no more”) plus when you’re supposed to clap your hands.
In other words, I have a confused array of feelings and thoughts about
violence, aggression, and competition. Just like most humans.
To preach from an obvious soapbox, our species has problems with violence.
We have the means to create thousands of mushroom clouds; shower heads and
subway ventilation systems have carried poison gas, letters have carried anthrax,
passenger planes have become weapons; mass rapes can constitute a military
strategy; bombs go off in markets, schoolchildren with guns massacre other
children; there are neighborhoods where everyone from pizza delivery guys to
firefighters fears for their safety. And there are the subtler versions of violence—
say, a childhood of growing up abused, or the effects on a minority people when
the symbols of the majority shout domination and menace. We are always
shadowed by the threat of other humans harming us.
If that were solely the way things are, violence would be an easy problem to
approach intellectually. AIDS—unambiguously bad news—eradicate.
Alzheimer’s disease—same thing. Schizophrenia, cancer, malnutrition, flesh-
eating bacteria, global warming, comets hitting earth—ditto.
The problem, though, is that violence doesn’t go on that list. Sometimes we
have no problem with it at all.
This is a central point of this book—we don’t hate violence. We hate and fear
the wrong kind of violence, violence in the wrong context. Because violence in
the right context is different. We pay good money to watch it in a stadium, we
teach our kids to fight back, we feel proud when, in creaky middle age, we
manage a dirty hip-check in a weekend basketball game. Our conversations are
filled with military metaphors—we rally the troops after our ideas get shot
down. Our sports teams’ names celebrate violence—Warriors, Vikings, Lions,
Tigers, and Bears. We even think this way about something as cerebral as chess
—“Kasparov kept pressing for a murderous attack. Toward the end, Kasparov
had to oppose threats of violence with more of the same.”1 We build theologies
around violence, elect leaders who excel at it, and in the case of so many
women, preferentially mate with champions of human combat. When it’s the
“right” type of aggression, we love it.
It is the ambiguity of violence, that we can pull a trigger as an act of hideous
aggression or of self-sacrificing love, that is so challenging. As a result, violence
will always be a part of the human experience that is profoundly hard to
understand.
This book explores the biology of violence, aggression, and competition—
the behaviors and the impulses behind them, the acts of individuals, groups, and
states, and when these are bad or good things. It is a book about the ways in
which humans harm one another. But it is also a book about the ways in which
people do the opposite. What does biology teach us about cooperation,
affiliation, reconciliation, empathy, and altruism?
The book has a number of personal roots. One is that, having had blessedly
little personal exposure to violence in my life, the entire phenomenon scares the
crap out of me. I think like an academic egghead, believing that if I write enough
paragraphs about a scary subject, give enough lectures about it, it will give up
and go away quietly. And if everyone took enough classes about the biology of
violence and studied hard, we’d all be able to take a nap between the snoozing
lion and lamb. Such is the delusional sense of efficacy of a professor.
Then there’s the other personal root for this book. I am by nature majorly
pessimistic. Give me any topic and I’ll find a way in which things will fall apart.
Or turn out wonderfully and somehow, because of that, be poignant and sad. It’s
a pain in the butt, especially to people stuck around me. And when I had kids, I
realized that I needed to get ahold of this tendency big time. So I looked for
evidence that things weren’t quite that bad. I started small, practicing on them—
don’t cry, a T. rex would never come and eat you; of course Nemo’s daddy will
find him. And as I’ve learned more about the subject of this book, there’s been
an unexpected realization—the realms of humans harming one another are
neither universal nor inevitable, and we’re getting some scientific insights into
how to avoid them. My pessimistic self has a hard time admitting this, but there
is room for optimism.
I
THE APPROACH IN THIS BOOK
make my living as a combination neurobiologist—someone who studies the
brain—and primatologist—someone who studies monkeys and apes. Therefore,
this is a book that is rooted in science, specifically biology. And out of that come
three key points. First, you can’t begin to understand things like aggression,
competition, cooperation, and empathy without biology; I say this for the benefit
of a certain breed of social scientist who finds biology to be irrelevant and a bit
ideologically suspect when thinking about human social behavior. But just as
important, second, you’re just as much up the creek if you rely only on biology;
this is said for the benefit of a style of molecular fundamentalist who believes
that the social sciences are destined to be consumed by “real” science. And as a
third point, by the time you finish this book, you’ll see that it actually makes no
sense to distinguish between aspects of a behavior that are “biological” and those
that would be described as, say, “psychological” or “cultural.” Utterly
intertwined.
Understanding the biology of these human behaviors is obviously important.
But unfortunately it is hellishly complicated.2 Now, if you were interested in the
biology of, say, how migrating birds navigate, or in the mating reflex that occurs
in female hamsters when they’re ovulating, this would be an easier task. But
that’s not what we’re interested in. Instead, it’s human behavior, human social
behavior, and in many cases abnormal human social behavior. And it is indeed a
mess, a subject involving brain chemistry, hormones, sensory cues, prenatal
environment, early experience, genes, both biological and cultural evolution, and
ecological pressures, among other things.
How are we supposed to make sense of all these factors in thinking about
behavior? We tend to use a certain cognitive strategy when dealing with
complex, multifaceted phenomena, in that we break down those separate facets
into categories, into buckets of explanation. Suppose there’s a rooster standing
next to you, and there’s a chicken across the street. The rooster gives a sexually
solicitive gesture that is hot by chicken standards, and she promptly runs over to
mate with him (I haven’t a clue if this is how it works, but let’s just suppose).
And thus we have a key behavioral biological question—why did the chicken
cross the road? And if you’re a psychoneuroendocrinologist, your answer would
be “Because circulating estrogen levels in that chicken worked in a certain part
of her brain to make her responsive to this male signaling,” and if you’re a
bioengineer, the answer would be “Because the long bone in the leg of the
chicken forms a fulcrum for her pelvis (or some such thing), allowing her to
move forward rapidly,” and if you’re an evolutionary biologist, you’d say,
“Because over the course of millions of years, chickens that responded to such
gestures at a time that they were fertile left more copies of their genes, and thus
this is now an innate behavior in chickens,” and so on, thinking in categories, in
differing scientific disciplines of explanation.
The goal of this book is to avoid such categorical thinking. Putting facts into
nice cleanly demarcated buckets of explanation has its advantages—for example,
it can help you remember facts better. But it can wreak havoc on your ability to
think about those facts. This is because the boundaries between different
categories are often arbitrary, but once some arbitrary boundary exists, we forget
that it is arbitrary and get way too impressed with its importance. For example,
the visual spectrum is a continuum of wavelengths from violet to red, and it is
arbitrary where boundaries are put for different color names (for example, where
we see a transition from “blue” to “green”); as proof of this, different languages
arbitrarily split up the visual spectrum at different points in coming up with the
words for different colors. Show someone two roughly similar colors. If the
color-name boundary in that person’s language happens to fall between the two
colors, the person will overestimate the difference between the two. If the colors
fall in the same category, the opposite happens. In other words, when you think
categorically, you have trouble seeing how similar or different two things are. If
you pay lots of attention to where boundaries are, you pay less attention to
complete pictures.
Thus, the official intellectual goal of this book is to avoid using categorical
buckets when thinking about the biology of some of our most complicated
behaviors, even more complicated than chickens crossing roads.
What’s the replacement?
A behavior has just occurred. Why did it happen? Your first category of
explanation is going to be a neurobiological one. What went on in that person’s
brain a second before the behavior happened? Now pull out to a slightly larger
field of vision, your next category of explanation, a little earlier in time. What
sight, sound, or smell in the previous seconds to minutes triggered the nervous
system to produce that behavior? On to the next explanatory category. What
hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual
was to the sensory stimuli that trigger the nervous system to produce the
behavior? And by now you’ve increased your field of vision to be thinking about
neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and short-term
endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.
And you just keep expanding. What features of the environment in the prior
weeks to years changed the structure and function of that person’s brain and thus
changed how it responded to those hormones and environmental stimuli? Then
you go further back to the childhood of the individual, their fetal environment,
then their genetic makeup. And then you increase the view to encompass factors
larger than that one individual—how has culture shaped the behavior of people
living in that individual’s group?—what ecological factors helped shape that
culture—expanding and expanding until considering events umpteen millennia
ago and the evolution of that behavior.
Okay, so this represents an improvement—it seems like instead of trying to
explain all of behavior with a single discipline (e.g., “Everything can be
explained with knowledge about this particular [take your pick:]
hormone/gene/childhood event”), we’ll be thinking about a bunch of disciplinary
buckets. But something subtler will be done, and this is the most important idea
in the book: when you explain a behavior with one of these disciplines, you are
implicitly invoking all the disciplines—any given type of explanation is the end
product of the influences that preceded it. It has to work this way. If you say,
“The behavior occurred because of the release of neurochemical Y in the brain,”
you are also saying, “The behavior occurred because the heavy secretion of
hormone X this morning increased the levels of neurochemical Y.” You’re also
saying, “The behavior occurred because the environment in which that person
was raised made her brain more likely to release neurochemical Y in response to
certain types of stimuli.” And you’re also saying, “. . . because of the gene that
codes for the particular version of neurochemical Y.” And if you’ve so much as
whispered the word “gene,” you’re also saying, “. . . and because of the
millennia of factors that shaped the evolution of that particular gene.” And so on.
There are not different disciplinary buckets. Instead, each one is the end
product of all the biological influences that came before it and will influence all
the factors that follow it. Thus, it is impossible to conclude that a behavior is
caused by a gene, a hormone, a childhood trauma, because the second you
invoke one type of explanation, you are de facto invoking them all. No buckets.
A “neurobiological” or “genetic” or “developmental” explanation for a behavior
is just shorthand, an expository convenience for temporarily approaching the
whole multifactorial arc from a particular perspective.
Pretty impressive, huh? Actually, maybe not. Maybe I’m just pretentiously
saying, “You have to think complexly about complex things.” Wow, what a
revelation. And maybe what I’ve been tacitly setting up is this full-of-ourselves
straw man of “Ooh, we’re going to think subtly. We won’t get suckered into
simplistic answers, not like those chicken-crossing-the-road neurochemists and
chicken evolutionary biologists and chicken psychoanalysts, all living in their
own limited categorical buckets.”
Obviously, scientists aren’t like that. They’re smart. They understand that
they need to take lots of angles into account. Of necessity, their research may
focus on a narrow subject, because there are limits to how much one person can
obsess over. But of course they know that their particular categorical bucket isn’t
the whole story.
Maybe yes, maybe no. Consider the following quotes from some card-
carrying scientists. The first:
Give me a dozen healthy infants, well formed, and my own specified
world to bring them up in and I’ll guarantee to take any one at random
and train him to become any type of specialist I might select—doctor,
lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and yes, even beggar-man thief, regardless
of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his
ancestors.3
This was John Watson, a founder of behaviorism, writing around 1925.
Behaviorism, with its notion that behavior is completely malleable, that it can be
shaped into anything in the right environment, dominated American psychology
in the midtwentieth century; we’ll return to behaviorism, and its considerable
limitations. The point is that Watson was pathologically caught inside a bucket
having to do with the environmental influences on development. “I’ll
guarantee . . . to train him to become any type.” Yet we are not all born the same,
with the same potential, regardless of how we are trained.*4
The next quote:
Normal psychic life depends upon the good functioning of brain
synapses, and
