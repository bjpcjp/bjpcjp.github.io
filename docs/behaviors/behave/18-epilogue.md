Epilogue
e’ve covered lots of ground, and some themes have arisen repeatedly.
It’s worth reviewing them before considering two final points.
As the single most important of them, virtually every scientific fact presented
in this book concerns the average of what’s being measured. There is always
variation, and it’s often the most interesting thing about a fact. Not every person
activates the amygdala when seeing the face of a Them; not every yeast adheres
to another one bearing the same surface protein marker. Instead, on the average,
both do. Reflecting this, I’ve just discovered that this book contains variations on
“average,” “typically,” “usually,” “often,” “tend to,” and “generally” more than
five hundred times. And I probably should have inserted them even more as
reminders. There are individual differences and interesting exceptions
everywhere you look in science.
Now, in no particular order:
It’s great if your frontal cortex lets you avoid temptation,
allowing you to do the harder, better thing. But it’s usually more
effective if doing that better thing has become so automatic that
it isn’t hard. And it’s often easiest to avoid temptation with
distraction and reappraisal rather than willpower.
While it’s cool that there’s so much plasticity in the brain, it’s no
surprise—it has to work that way.
Childhood adversity can scar everything from our DNA to our
cultures, and effects can be lifelong, even multigenerational.
However, more adverse consequences can be reversed than used
to be thought. But the longer you wait to intervene, the harder it
will be.
Brains and cultures coevolve.
Things that seem morally obvious and intuitive now weren’t
necessarily so in the past; many started with nonconforming
reasoning.
Repeatedly, biological factors (e.g., hormones) don’t so much
cause a behavior as modulate and sensitize, lowering thresholds
for environmental stimuli to cause it.
Cognition and affect always interact. What’s interesting is when
one dominates.
Genes have different effects in different environments; a
hormone can make you nicer or crummier, depending on your
values; we haven’t evolved to be “selfish” or “altruistic” or
anything else—we’ve evolved to be particular ways in particular
settings. Context, context, context.
Biologically, intense love and intense hate aren’t opposites. The
opposite of each is indifference.
Adolescence shows us that the most interesting part of the brain
evolved to be shaped minimally by genes and maximally by
experience; that’s how we learn—context, context, context.
Arbitrary boundaries on continua can be helpful. But never
forget that they are arbitrary.
Often we’re more about the anticipation and pursuit of pleasure
than about the experience of it.
You can’t understand aggression without understanding fear
(and what the amygdala has to do with both).
Genes aren’t about inevitabilities; they’re about potentials and
vulnerabilities. And they don’t determine anything on their own.
Gene/environment interactions are everywhere. Evolution is
most consequential when altering regulation of genes, rather
than genes themselves.
We implicitly divide the world into Us and Them, and prefer the
former. We are easily manipulated, even subliminally and within
seconds, as to who counts as each.
We aren’t chimps, and we aren’t bonobos. We’re not a classic
pair-bonding species or a tournament species. We’ve evolved to
be somewhere in between in these and other categories that are
clear-cut in other animals. It makes us a much more malleable
and resilient species. It also makes our social lives much more
confusing and messy, filled with imperfection and wrong turns.
The homunculus has no clothes.
While traditional nomadic hunter-gatherer life over hundreds of
thousands of years might have been a little on the boring side, it
certainly wasn’t ceaselessly bloody. In the years since most
humans abandoned a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, we’ve obviously
invented many things. One of the most interesting and
challenging is social systems where we can be surrounded by
strangers and can act anonymously.
Saying a biological system works “well” is a value-free
assessment; it can take discipline, hard work, and willpower to
accomplish either something wondrous or something appalling.
“Doing the right thing” is always context dependent.
Many of our best moments of morality and compassion have
roots far deeper and older than being mere products of human
civilization.
Be dubious about someone who suggests that other types of
people are like little crawly, infectious things.
When humans invented socioeconomic status, they invented a
way to subordinate like nothing that hierarchical primates had
ever seen before.
“Me” versus “us” (being prosocial within your group) is easier
than “us” versus “them” (prosociality between groups).
It’s not great if someone believes it’s okay for people to do some
horrible, damaging act. But more of the world’s misery arises
from people who, of course, oppose that horrible act . . . but cite
some particular circumstances that should make them
exceptions. The road to hell is paved with rationalization.
The certainty with which we act now might seem ghastly not
only to future generations but to our future selves as well.
Neither the capacity for fancy, rarefied moral reasoning nor for
feeling great empathy necessarily translates into actually doing
something difficult, brave, and compassionate.
People kill and are willing to be killed for symbolic sacred
values. Negotiations can make peace with Them; understanding
and respecting the intensity of their sacred values can make
lasting peace.
We are constantly being shaped by seemingly irrelevant stimuli,
subliminal information, and internal forces we don’t know a
thing about.
Our worst behaviors, ones we condemn and punish, are the
products of our biology. But don’t forget that the same applies to
our best behaviors.
Individuals no more exceptional than the rest of us provide
stunning examples of our finest moments as humans.
Two Last Thoughts
If you had to boil this book down to a single phrase, it would be
“It’s complicated.” Nothing seems to cause anything; instead
everything just modulates something else. Scientists keep
saying, “We used to think X, but now we realize that . . .” Fixing
one thing often messes up ten more, as the law of unintended
consequences reigns. On any big, important issue it seems like
51 percent of the scientific studies conclude one thing, and 49
percent conclude the opposite. And so on. Eventually it can
seem hopeless that you can actually fix something, can make
things better. But we have no choice but to try. And if you are
reading this, you are probably ideally suited to do so. You’ve
amply proven you have intellectual tenacity. You probably also
have running water, a home, adequate calories, and low odds of
festering with a bad parasitic disease. You probably don’t have
to worry about Ebola virus, warlords, or being invisible in your
world. And you’ve been educated. In other words, you’re one of
the lucky humans. So try.
Finally, you don’t have to choose between being scientific and
being compassionate.
