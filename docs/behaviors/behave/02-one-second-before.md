One Second Before
arious muscles have moved, and a behavior has happened. Perhaps it is a
good act: you’ve empathically touched the arm of a suffering person.
Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve pulled a trigger, targeting an innocent person.
Perhaps it is a good act: you’ve pulled a trigger, drawing fire to save others.
Perhaps it is a foul act: you’ve touched the arm of someone, starting a chain of
libidinal events that betray a loved one. Acts that, as emphasized, are definable
only by context.
Thus, to ask the question that will begin this and the next eight chapters, why
did that behavior occur?
As this book’s starting point, we know that different disciplines produce
different answers—because of some hormone; because of evolution; because of
childhood experiences or genes or culture—and as the book’s central premise,
these are utterly intertwined answers, none standing alone. But on the most
proximal level, in this chapter we ask: What happened one second before the
behavior that caused it to occur? This puts us in the realm of neurobiology, of
understanding the brain that commanded those muscles.
This chapter is one of the book’s anchors. The brain is the final common
pathway, the conduit that mediates the influences of all the distal factors to be
covered in the chapters to come. What happened an hour, a decade, a million
years earlier? What happened were factors that impacted the brain and the
behavior it produced.
This chapter has two major challenges. The first is its god-awful length.
Apologies; I’ve tried to be succinct and nontechnical, but this is foundational
material that needs to be covered. Second, regardless of how nontechnical I’ve
tried to be, the material can overwhelm someone with no background in
neuroscience. To help with that, please wade through appendix 1 around now.

Now we ask: What crucial things happened in the second before that pro- or
antisocial behavior occurred? Or, translated into neurobiology: What was going
on with action potentials, neurotransmitters, and neural circuits in particular
brain regions during that second?
W
THREE METAPHORICAL (BUT NOT LITERAL)
LAYERS
e start by considering the brain’s macroorganization, using a model
proposed in the 1960s by the neuroscientist Paul MacLean.1 His “triune
brain” model conceptualizes the brain as having three functional domains:
Layer 1: An ancient part of the brain, at its base, found in species from humans
to geckos. This layer mediates automatic, regulatory functions. If body
temperature drops, this brain region senses it and commands muscles to shiver. If
blood glucose levels plummet, that’s sensed here, generating hunger. If an injury
occurs, a different loop initiates a stress response.
Layer 2: A more recently evolved region that has expanded in mammals.
MacLean conceptualized this layer as being about emotions, somewhat of a
mammalian invention. If you see something gruesome and terrifying, this layer
sends commands down to ancient layer 1, making you shiver with emotion. If
you’re feeling sadly unloved, regions here prompt layer 1 to generate a craving
for comfort food. If you’re a rodent and smell a cat, neurons here cause layer 1
to initiate a stress response.
Layer 3: The recently evolved layer of neocortex sitting on the upper surface
of the brain. Proportionately, primates devote more of their brain to this layer
than do other species. Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing,
abstractions, philosophy, navel contemplation. Read a scary passage of a book,
and layer 3 signals layer 2 to make you feel frightened, prompting layer 1 to
initiate shivering. See an ad for Oreos and feel a craving—layer 3 influences
layers 2 and 1. Contemplate the fact that loved ones won’t live forever, or kids in
refugee camps, or how the Na’vis’ home tree was destroyed by those jerk
humans in Avatar (despite the fact that, wait, Na’vi aren’t real!), and layer 3
pulls layers 2 and 1 into the picture, and you feel sad and have the same sort of
stress response that you’d have if you were fleeing a lion.
Thus we’ve got the brain divided into three functional buckets, with the
usual advantages and disadvantages of categorizing a continuum. The biggest
disadvantage is how simplistic this is. For example:
a. Anatomically there is considerable overlap among the three
layers (for example, one part of the cortex can best be thought of
as part of layer 2; stay tuned).
b. The flow of information and commands is not just top down,
from layer 3 to 2 to 1. A weird, great example explored in
chapter 15: if someone is holding a cold drink (temperature is
processed in layer 1), they’re more likely to judge someone they
meet as having a cold personality (layer 3).
c. Automatic aspects of behavior (simplistically, the purview of
layer 1), emotion (layer 2), and thought (layer 3) are not
separable.
d. The triune model leads one, erroneously, to think that evolution
in effect slapped on each new layer without any changes
occurring in the one(s) already there.
Despite these drawbacks, which MacLean himself emphasized, this model
will be a good organizing metaphor for us.
T
THE LIMBIC SYSTEM
o make sense of our best and worst behaviors, automaticity, emotion, and
cognition must all be considered; I arbitrarily start with layer 2 and its
emphasis on emotion.
Early-twentieth-century neuroscientists thought it obvious what layer 2 did.
Take your standard-issue lab animal, a rat, and examine its brain. Right at the
front would be these two gigantic lobes, the “olfactory bulbs” (one for each
nostril), the primary receptive area for odors.
Neuroscientists at the time asked what parts of the brain these gigantic rodent
olfactory bulbs talked to (i.e., where they sent their axonal projections). Which
brain regions were only a single synapse away from receiving olfactory
information, which were two synapses, three, and so on?
And it was layer 2 structures that received the first communiqués. Ah,
everyone concluded, this part of the brain must process odors, and so it was
termed the rhinencephalon—the nose brain.
Meanwhile, in the thirties and forties, neuroscientists such as the young
MacLean, James Papez, Paul Bucy, and Heinrich Klüver were starting to figure
out what the layer 2 structures did. For example, if you lesion (i.e., destroy) layer
2 structures, this produces “Klüver-Bucy syndrome,” featuring abnormalities in
sociality, especially in sexual and aggressive behaviors. They concluded that
these structures, soon termed the “limbic system” (for obscure reasons), were
about emotion.
Rhinencephalon or limbic system? Olfaction or emotion? Pitched street
battles ensued until someone pointed out the obvious—for a rat, emotion and
olfaction are nearly synonymous, since nearly all the environmental stimuli that
elicit emotions in a rodent are olfactory. Peace in our time. In a rodent, olfactory
inputs are what the limbic system most depends on for emotional news of the
world. In contrast, the primate limbic system is more informed by visual inputs.
Limbic function is now recognized as central to the emotions that fuel our
best and worst behaviors, and extensive research has uncovered the functions of
its structures (e.g., the amygdala, hippocampus, septum, habenula, and
mammillary bodies).
There really aren’t “centers” in the brain “for” particular behaviors. This is
particularly the case with the limbic system and emotion. There is indeed a sub-
subregion of the motor cortex that approximates being the “center” for making
your left pinkie bend; other regions have “center”-ish roles in regulating
breathing or body temperature. But there sure aren’t centers for feeling pissy or
horny, for feeling bittersweet nostalgia or warm protectiveness tinged with
contempt, or for that what-is-that-thing-called-love feeling. No surprise, then,
that the circuitry connecting various limbic structures is immensely complex.
The Autonomic Nervous System and the Ancient Core
Regions of the Brain
The limbic system’s regions form complex circuits of excitation and
inhibition. It’s easier to understand this by appreciating the deeply held desire of
every limbic structure—to influence what the hypothalamus does.
Why? Because of its importance. The hypothalamus, a limbic structure, is
the interface between layers 1 and 2, between core regulatory and emotional
parts of the brain.
Consistent with that, the hypothalamus gets massive inputs from limbic layer
2 structures but disproportionately sends projections to layer 1 regions. These are
the evolutionarily ancient midbrain and brain stem, which regulate automatic
reactions throughout the body.
For a reptile such automatic regulation is straightforward. If muscles are
working hard, this is sensed by neurons throughout the body that send signals up
the spine to layer 1 regions, resulting in signals back down the spine that
increase heart rate and blood pressure; the result is more oxygen and glucose for
the muscles. Gorge on food, and stomach walls distend; neurons embedded there
sense this and pass on the news, and soon blood vessels in the gut dilate,
increasing blood flow and facilitating digestion. Too warm? Blood is sent to the
body’s surface to dissipate heat.
—
All of this is automatic, or “autonomic.” And thus the midbrain and brain-stem
regions, along with their projections down the spine and out to the body, are
collectively termed the “autonomic nervous system.”*
And where does the hypothalamus come in? It’s the means by which the
limbic system influences autonomic function, how layer 2 talks to layer 1. Have
a full bladder with its muscle walls distended, and midbrain/brain-stem circuitry
votes for urinating. Be exposed to something sufficiently terrifying, and limbic
structures, via the hypothalamus, persuade the midbrain and brain stem to do the
same. This is how emotions change bodily functions, why limbic roads
eventually lead to the hypothalamus.*
The autonomic nervous system has two parts—the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems, with fairly opposite functions.
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates the body’s response to
arousing circumstances, for example, producing the famed “fight or flight” stress
response. To use the feeble joke told to first-year medical students, the SNS
mediates the “four Fs—fear, fight, flight, and sex.” Particular midbrain/brain-
stem nuclei send long SNS projections down the spine and on to outposts
throughout the body, where the axon terminals release the neurotransmitter
norepinephrine. There’s one exception that makes the SNS more familiar. In the
adrenal gland, instead of norepinephrine (aka noradrenaline) being released, it’s
epinephrine (aka the famous adrenaline).*
Meanwhile, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) arises from different
midbrain/brain-stem nuclei that project down the spine to the body. In contrast to
the SNS and the four Fs, the PNS is about calm, vegetative states. The SNS
speeds up the heart; the PNS slows it down. The PNS promotes digestion; the
SNS inhibits it (which makes sense—if you’re running for your life, avoiding
being someone’s lunch, don’t waste energy digesting breakfast).* And as we will
see chapter 14, if seeing someone in pain activates your SNS, you’re likely to be
preoccupied with your own distress instead of helping; turn on the PNS, and it’s
the opposite. Given that the SNS and PNS do opposite things, the PNS is
obviously going to be releasing a different neurotransmitter from its axon
terminals—acetylcholine.*
There is a second, equally important way in which emotion influences the
body. Specifically, the hypothalamus also regulates the release of many
hormones; this is covered in chapter 4.
—
So the limbic system indirectly regulates autonomic function and hormone
release. What does this have to do with behavior? Plenty—because the
autonomic and hormonal states of the body feed back to the brain, influencing
behavior (typically unconsciously).* Stay tuned for more in chapters 3 and 4.
The Interface Between the Limbic System and the
Cortex
Time to add the cortex. As noted, this is the brain’s upper surface (its name
comes from the Latin cortic, meaning “tree bark”) and is the newest part of the
brain.
The cortex is the gleaming, logical, analytical crown jewel of layer 3. Most
sensory information flows there to be decoded. It’s where muscles are
commanded to move, where language is comprehended and produced, where
memories are stored, where spatial and mathematical skills reside, where
executive decisions are made. It floats above the limbic system, supporting
philosophers since at least Descartes who have emphasized the dichotomy
between thought and emotion.
Of course, that’s all wrong, as shown by the temperature of a cup—
something processed in the hypothalamus—altering assessment of the coldness
of someone’s personality. Emotions filter the nature and accuracy of what is
remembered. Stroke damage to certain cortical regions blocks the ability to
speak; some sufferers reroute the cerebral world of speech through emotive,
limbic detours—they can sing what they want to say. The cortex and limbic
system are not separate, as scads of axonal projections course between the two.
Crucially, those projections are bidirectional—the limbic system talks to the
cortex, rather than merely being reined in by it. The false dichotomy between
thought and feeling is presented in the classic Descartes’ Error, by the
neurologist Antonio Damasio of the University of Southern California; his work
is discussed later.2
While the hypothalamus dwells at the interface of layers 1 and 2, it is the
incredibly interesting frontal cortex that is the interface between layers 2 and 3.
Key insight into the frontal cortex was provided in the 1960s by a giant of
neuroscience, Walle Nauta of MIT.*3 Nauta studied what brain regions sent
axons to the frontal cortex and what regions got axons from it. And the frontal
cortex was bidirectionally enmeshed with the limbic system, leading him to
propose that the frontal cortex is a quasi member of the limbic system. Naturally,
everyone thought him daft. The frontal cortex was the most recently evolved part
of the very highbrow cortex—the only reason why the frontal cortex would ever
go slumming into the limbic system would be to preach honest labor and
Christian temperance to the urchins there.
Naturally, Nauta was right. In different circumstances the frontal cortex and
limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other, collaborate and coordinate, or
bicker and work at cross-purposes. It really is an honorary member of the limbic
system. And the interactions between the frontal cortex and (other) limbic
structures are at the core of much of this book.
Two more details. First, the cortex is not a smooth surface but instead is
folded into convolutions. The convolutions form a superstructure of four
separate lobes: the temporal, parietal, occipital, and frontal, each with different
functions.

Second, brains obviously have left and right sides, or “hemispheres,” that
roughly mirror each other.
Thus, except for the relatively few midline structures, brain regions come in
pairs (a left and right amygdala, hippocampus, temporal lobe, and so on).
Functions are often lateralized, such that the left and right hippocampi, for
example, have different but related functions. The greatest lateralization occurs
in the cortex; the left hemisphere is analytical, the right more involved in
intuition and creativity. These contrasts have caught the public fancy, with
cortical lateralization exaggerated by many to an absurd extent, where “left
brain”–edness has the connotation of anal-retentive bean counting and “right
brain”–edness is about making mandalas or singing with whales. In fact the
functional differences between the hemispheres are generally subtle, and I’m
mostly ignoring lateralization.
We’re now ready to examine the brain regions most central to this book,
namely the amygdala, the frontal cortex, and the mesolimbic/mesocortical
dopamine system (discussion of other bit-player regions will be subsumed under
the headings for these three). We start with the one arguably most central to our
worst behaviors.
T
THE AMYGDALA
he amygdala* is the archetypal limbic structure, sitting under the cortex in
the temporal lobe. It is central to mediating aggression, along with other
behaviors that tell us tons about aggression.
A First Pass at the Amygdala and Aggression
The evidence for the amygdala’s role in aggression is extensive, based on
research approaches that will become familiar.
First there’s the correlative “recording” approach. Stick recording electrodes
into numerous species’ amygdalae* and see when neurons there have action
potentials; this turns out to be when the animal is being aggressive.* In a related
approach, determine which brain regions consume extra oxygen or glucose, or
synthesize certain activity-related proteins, during aggression—the amygdala
tops the list.
Moving beyond mere correlation, if you lesion the amygdala in an animal,
rates of aggression decline. The same occurs transiently when you temporarily
silence the amygdala by injecting Novocain into it. Conversely, implanting
electrodes that stimulate neurons there, or spritzing in excitatory
neurotransmitters (stay tuned), triggers aggression.4
Show human subjects pictures that provoke anger, and the amygdala
activates (as shown with neuroimaging). Sticking an electrode in someone’s
amygdala and stimulating it (as is done before certain types of neurosurgery)
produces rage.
The most convincing data concern rare humans with damage restricted to the
amygdala, either due to a type of encephalitis or a congenital disorder called
Urbach-Wiethe disease, or where the amygdala was surgically destroyed to
control severe, drug-resistant seizures originating there.5 Such individuals are
impaired in detecting angry facial expressions (while being fine at recognizing
other emotional states—stay tuned).
And what does amygdala damage do to aggressive behavior? This was
studied in humans where amygdalotomies were done not to control seizures but
to control aggression. Such psychosurgery provoked fiery controversy in the
1970s. And I don’t mean scientists not saying hello to each other at conferences.
I mean a major public shit storm.
The issue raised bioethical lightning rods: What counted as pathological
aggression? Who decided? What other interventions had been tried
unsuccessfully? Were some types of hyperaggressive individuals more likely to
go under the knife than others? What constituted a cure?6
Most of these cases concerned rare epileptics where seizure onset was
associated with uncontrollable aggression, and where the goal was to contain
that behavior (these papers had titles such as “Clinical and physiological effects
of stereotaxic bilateral amygdalotomy for intractable aggression”). The fecal
hurricane concerned the involuntary lopping out of the amygdala in people
without epilepsy but with a history of severe aggression. Well, doing this could
be profoundly helpful. Or Orwellian. This is a long, dark story and I will save it
for another time.
Did destruction of the human amygdala lessen aggression? Pretty clearly so,
when violence was a reflexive, inchoate outburst preceding a seizure. But with
surgery done solely to control behavior, the answer is, er, maybe—the
heterogeneity of patients and surgical approaches, the lack of modern
neuroimaging to pinpoint exactly which parts of the amygdala were destroyed in
each individual, and the imprecision in the behavioral data (with papers
reporting from 33 to 100
