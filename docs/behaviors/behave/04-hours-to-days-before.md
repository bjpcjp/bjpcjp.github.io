Four
Hours to Days Before
e now take the next step back in our chronology, considering events
from hours to days before a behavior occurs. To do so, we enter the
realm of hormones. What are the effects of hormones on the brain and sensory
systems that filled the last two chapters? How do hormones influence our best
and worst behaviors?
While this chapter examines various hormones, the most attention is paid to
one inextricably tied to aggression, namely testosterone. And as the punch line,
testosterone is far less relevant to aggression than usually assumed. At the other
end of the spectrum, the chapter also considers a hormone with cult status for
fostering warm, fuzzy prosociality, namely oxytocin. As we’ll see, it’s not quite
as groovy as assumed.
Those who are unfamiliar with hormones and endocrinology, please see the
primer in appendix 2.
T
TESTOSTERONE’S BUM RAP
estosterone is secreted by the testes as the final step in the
“hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular” axis; it has effects on cells throughout
the body (including neurons, of course). And testosterone is everyone’s usual
suspect when it comes to the hormonal causes of aggression.
Correlation and Causality
Why is it that throughout the animal kingdom, and in every human culture,
males account for most aggression and violence? Well, what about testosterone
and some related hormones (collectively called “androgens,” a term that, unless
otherwise noted, I will use simplistically as synonymous with “testosterone”)? In
nearly all species males have more circulating testosterone than do females (who
secrete small amounts of androgens from the adrenal glands). Moreover, male
aggression is most prevalent when testosterone levels are highest (adolescence,
and during mating season in seasonal breeders).
Thus, testosterone and aggression are linked. Furthermore, there are
particularly high levels of testosterone receptors in the amygdala, in the way
station by which it projects to the rest of the brain (the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis), and in its major targets (the hypothalamus, the central gray of the
midbrain, and the frontal cortex). But these are merely correlative data. Showing
that testosterone causes aggression requires a “subtraction” plus a “replacement”
experiment. Subtraction—castrate a male. Do levels of aggression decrease? Yes
(including in humans). This shows that something coming from the testes causes
aggression. Is it testosterone? Replacement—give that castrated individual
replacement testosterone. Do precastration levels of aggression return? Yes
(including in humans).
Thus, testosterone causes aggression. Time to see how wrong that is.
The first hint of a complication comes after castration, when average levels
of aggression plummet in every species. But, crucially, not to zero. Well, maybe
the castration wasn’t perfect, you missed some bits of testes. Or maybe enough
of the minor adrenal androgens are secreted to maintain the aggression. But no—
even when testosterone and androgens are completely eliminated, some
aggression remains. Thus, some male aggression is testosterone independent.*
This point is driven home by castration of some sexual offenders, a legal
procedure in a few states.1 This is accomplished with “chemical castration,”
administration of drugs that either inhibit testosterone production or block
testosterone receptors.* Castration decreases sexual urges in the subset of sex
offenders with intense, obsessive, and pathological urges. But otherwise
castration doesn’t decrease recidivism rates; as stated in one meta-analysis,
“hostile rapists and those who commit sex crimes motivated by power or anger
are not amenable to treatment with [the antiandrogenic drugs].”
This leads to a hugely informative point: the more experience a male had
being aggressive prior to castration, the more aggression continues afterward. In
other words, the less his being aggressive in the future requires testosterone and
the more it’s a function of social learning.
On to the next issue that lessens the primacy of testosterone: What do
individual levels of testosterone have to do with aggression? If one person has
higher testosterone levels than another, or higher levels this week than last, are
they more likely to be aggressive?
Initially the answer seemed to be yes, as studies showed correlation between
individual differences in testosterone levels and levels of aggression. In a typical
study, higher testosterone levels would be observed in those male prisoners with
higher rates of aggression. But being aggressive stimulates testosterone
secretion; no wonder more aggressive individuals had higher levels. Such studies
couldn’t disentangle chickens and eggs.
Thus, a better question is whether differences in testosterone levels among
individuals predict who will be aggressive. And among birds, fish, mammals,
and especially other primates, the answer is generally no. This has been studied
extensively in humans, examining a variety of measures of aggression. And the
answer is clear. To quote the British endocrinologist John Archer in a definitive
2006 review, “There is a weak and inconsistent association between testosterone
levels and aggression in [human] adults, and . . . administration of testosterone to
volunteers typically does not increase their aggression.” The brain doesn’t pay
attention to fluctuations of testosterone levels within the normal range.2
(Things differ when levels are made “supraphysiological”—higher than the
body normally generates. This is the world of athletes and bodybuilders abusing
high-dose testosterone-like anabolic steroids; in that situation risk of aggression
does increase. Two complications: it’s not random who would choose to take
these drugs, and abusers are often already predisposed toward aggression;
supraphysiological levels of androgens generate anxiety and paranoia, and
increased aggression may be secondary to that.)3
Thus, aggression is typically more about social learning than about
testosterone, and differing levels of testosterone generally can’t explain why
some individuals are more aggressive than others. So what does testosterone
actually do to behavior?
Subtleties of Testosterone Effects
When looking at faces expressing strong emotions, we tend to make
microexpressions that mimic them; testosterone decreases such empathic
mimicry.*4 Moreover, testosterone makes people less adept at identifying
emotions by looking at people’s eyes, and faces of strangers activate the
amygdala more than familiar ones and are rated as less trustworthy.
Testosterone also increases confidence and optimism, while decreasing fear
and anxiety.5 This explains the “winner” effect in lab animals, where winning a
fight increases an animal’s willingness to participate in, and its success in,
another such interaction. Part of the increased success probably reflects the fact
that winning stimulates testosterone secretion, which increases glucose delivery
and metabolism in the animal’s muscles and makes his pheromones smell
scarier. Moreover, winning increases the number of testosterone receptors in the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (the way station through which the amygdala
communicates with the rest of the brain), increasing its sensitivity to the
hormone. Success in everything from athletics to chess to the stock market
boosts testosterone levels.
Confident and optimistic. Well, endless self-help books urge us to be
precisely that. But testosterone makes people overconfident and overly
optimistic, with bad consequences. In one study, pairs of subjects could consult
each other before making individual choices in a task. Testosterone made
subjects more likely to think their opinion was correct and to ignore input from
their partner. Testosterone makes people cocky, egocentric, and narcissistic.6
Testosterone boosts impulsivity and risk taking, making people do the easier
thing when it’s the dumb-ass thing to do.7 Testosterone does this by decreasing
activity in the prefrontal cortex and its functional coupling to the amygdala and
increasing amygdaloid coupling with the thalamus—the source of that shortcut
path of sensory information into the amygdala. Thus, more influence by split-
second, low-accuracy inputs and less by the let’s-stop-and-think-about-this
frontal cortex.
Being fearless, overconfident, and delusionally optimistic sure feels good.
No surprise, then, that testosterone can be pleasurable. Rats will work (by
pressing levers) to be infused with testosterone and show “conditioned place
preference,” returning to a random corner of the cage where infusions occur. “I
don’t know why, but I feel good whenever I stand there.”8,9
The underlying neurobiology fits perfectly. Dopamine is needed for place-
preference conditioning to occur, and testosterone increases activity in the
ventral tegmentum, the source of those mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine
projections. Moreover, conditioned place preference is induced when
testosterone is infused directly into the nucleus accumbens, the ventral
tegmentum’s main projection target. When a rat wins a fight, the number of
testosterone receptors increases in the ventral tegmentum and accumbens,
increasing sensitivity to the hormone’s feel-good effects.10
So testosterone does subtle things to behavior. Nonetheless, this doesn’t tell
us much because everything can be interpreted every which way. Testosterone
increases anxiety—you feel threatened and become more reactively aggressive.
Testosterone decreases anxiety—you feel cocky and overconfident, become
more preemptively aggressive. Testosterone increases risk taking—“Hey, let’s
gamble and invade.” Testosterone increases risk taking—“Hey, let’s gamble and
make a peace offer.” Testosterone makes you feel good—“Let’s start another
fight, since the last one went swell.” Testosterone makes you feel good—“Let’s
all hold hands.”
It’s a crucial unifying concept that testosterone’s effects are hugely context
dependent.
Contingent Testosterone Effects
This context dependency means that rather than causing X, testosterone
amplifies the power of something else to cause X.
A classic example comes from a 1977 study of groups of male talapoin
monkeys.11 Testosterone was administered to the middle-ranking male in each
group (say, rank number 3 out of five), increasing their levels of aggression.
Does this mean that these guys, stoked on ’roids, started challenging numbers 1
and 2 in the hierarchy? No. They became aggressive jerks to poor numbers 4 and
5. Testosterone did not create new social patterns of aggression; it exaggerated
preexisting ones.
In human studies testosterone didn’t raise baseline activity in the amygdala;
it boosted the amygdala’s response and heart-rate reactivity to angry faces (but
not to happy or neutral ones). Similarly, testosterone did not make subjects more
selfish and uncooperative in an economic game; it made them more punitive
when provoked by being treated poorly, enhancing “vengeful reactive
aggression.”12
The context dependency also occurs on the neurobiological level, in that the
hormone shortens the refractory period of neurons in the amygdala and
amygdaloid targets in the hypothalamus.13 Recall that the refractory period
comes in neurons after action potentials. This is when the neuron’s resting
potential is hyperpolarized (i.e., when it is more negatively charged than usual),
making the neuron less excitable, producing a period of silence after the action
potential. Thus, shorter refractory periods mean a higher rate of action potentials.
So is testosterone causing action potentials in these neurons? No. It’s causing
them to fire at a faster rate if they are stimulated by something else. Similarly,
testosterone increases amygdala response to angry faces, but not to other sorts.
Thus, if the amygdala is already responding to some realm of social learning,
testosterone ups the volume.
A Key Synthesis: The Challenge Hypothesis
Thus, testosterone’s actions are contingent and amplifying, exacerbating
preexisting tendencies toward aggression rather than creating aggression out of
thin air. This picture inspired the “challenge hypothesis,” a wonderfully unifying
conceptualization of testosterone’s actions.14 As proposed in 1990 by the superb
behavioral endocrinologist John Wingfield of the University of California at
Davis, and colleagues, the idea is that rising testosterone levels increase
aggression only at the time of a challenge. Which is precisely how things work.
The explains why basal levels of testosterone have little to do with
subsequent aggression, and why increases in testosterone due to puberty, sexual
stimulation, or the start of mating season don’t increase aggression either.15
But things are different during challenges.16 Among various primates,
testosterone levels rise when a dominance hierarchy first forms or undergoes
reorganization. Testosterone rises in humans in both individual and team sports
competition, including basketball, wrestling, tennis, rugby, and judo; there’s
generally a rise in anticipation of the event and a larger one afterward, especially
among winners.* Remarkably, watching your favorite team win raises
testosterone levels, showing that the rise is less about muscle activity than about
the psychology of dominance, identification, and self-esteem.
Most important, the rise in testosterone after a challenge makes aggression
more likely.17 Think about this. Testosterone levels rise, reaching the brain. If
this occurs because someone is challenging you, you head in the direction of
aggression. If an identical rise occurs because days are lengthening and mating
season is approaching, you decide to fly a thousand miles to your breeding
grounds. And if the same occurs because of puberty, you get stupid and giggly
around that girl who plays clarinet in the band. The context dependency is
remarkable.*18
The challenge hypothesis has a second part to it. When testosterone rises
after a challenge, it doesn’t prompt aggression. Instead it prompts whatever
behaviors are needed to maintain status. This changes things enormously.
Well, maybe not, since maintaining status for, say, male primates consists
mostly of aggression or threats of it—from slashing your opponent to giving a
“You have no idea who you’re screwing with” stare.19
And now for some flabbergastingly important research. What happens if
defending your status requires you to be nice? This was explored in a study by
Christoph Eisenegger and Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich.20 Participants
played the Ultimatum Game (introduced in chapter 2), where you decide how to
split money between you and another player. The other person can accept the
split or reject it, in which case neither of you gets anything. Prior research had
shown that when someone’s offer is rejected, they feel dissed, subordinated,
especially if news of that carries into future rounds with other players. In other
words, in this scenario status and reputation rest on being fair.
And what happens when subjects were given testosterone beforehand?
People made more generous offers. What the hormone makes you do depends on
what counts as being studly. This requires some fancy neuroendocrine wiring
that is sensitive to social learning. You couldn’t ask for a finding more counter to
testosterone’s reputation.
The study contained a slick additional finding that further separated
testosterone myth from reality. As per usual, subjects got either testosterone or
saline, without knowing which. Subjects who believed it was testosterone
(independent of whether it actually was) made less generous offers. In other
words, testosterone doesn’t necessarily make you behave in a crappy manner,
but believing that it does and that you’re drowning in the stuff makes you behave
in a crappy manner.
Additional studies show that testosterone promotes prosociality in the right
setting. In one, under circumstances where someone’s sense of pride rides on
honesty, testosterone decreased men’s cheating in a game. In another, subjects
decided how much of a sum of money they would keep and how much they
would publicly contribute to a common pool shared by all the players;
testosterone made most subjects more prosocial.21
What does this mean? Testosterone makes us more willing to do what it takes
to attain and maintain status. And the key point is what it takes. Engineer social
circumstances right, and boosting testosterone levels during a challenge would
make people compete like crazy to do the most acts of random kindness. In our
world riddled with male violence, the problem isn’t that testosterone can
increase levels of aggression. The problem is the frequency with which we
reward aggression.

OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN: A
MARKETING DREAM
f the point of the preceding section is that testosterone has gotten a bum rap,
the point of this one is that oxytocin (and the closely related vasopressin) is
coasting in a Teflon presidency. According to lore, oxytocin makes organisms
less aggressive, more socially attuned, trusting, and empathic. Individuals treated
with oxytocin become more faithful partners and more attentive parents. It
makes lab rats more charitable and better listeners, makes fruit flies sing like
Joan Baez. Naturally, things are more complicated, and oxytocin has an
informative dark side.
Basics
Oxytocin and vasopressin are chemically similar hormones; the DNA
sequences that constitute their genes are similar, and the two genes occur close to
each other on the same chromosome. There was a single ancestral gene that, a
few hundred million years ago, was accidentally “duplicated” in the genome,
and the DNA sequences in the two copies of the gene drifted independently,
evolving into two closely related genes (stay tuned for more in chapter 8). This
gene duplication occurred as mammals were emerging; other vertebrates have
only the ancestral version, called vasotocin, which is structurally between the
two separate mammalian hormones.
For twentieth-century neurobiologists, oxytocin and vasopressin were pretty
boring. They were made in hypothalamic neurons that sent axons to the posterior
pituitary. There they would be released into circulation, thereby attaining
hormone status, and have nothing to do with the brain ever again. Oxytocin
stimulated uterine contraction during labor and milk letdown afterward.
Vasopressin (aka “antidiuretic hormone”) regulated water retention in the
kidneys. And reflecting their similar structures, each also had mild versions of
the other one’s effects. End of story.
Neurobiologists Take Notice
Things became interesting with the discovery that those hypothalamic
neurons that made oxytocin and vasopressin also sent projections throughout the
brain, including the dopamine-related ventral tegmentum and nucleus
accumbens, hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal cortex, all regions with ample
levels of receptors for the hormones. Moreover, oxytocin and vasopressin turned
out to be synthesized and secreted elsewhere in the brain. These two boring,
classical peripheral hormones affected brain function and behavior. They started
being called “neuropeptides”—neuroactive messengers with a peptide structure
—which is a fancy way of saying they are small proteins (and, to avoid writing
“oxytocin and vasopressin” endlessly, I will refer to them as neuropeptides; note
though that there are other neuropeptides).
The initial findings about their behavioral effects made sense.22 Oxytocin
prepares the body of a female mammal for birth and lactation; logically, oxytocin
also facilitates maternal behavior. The brain boosts oxytocin production when a
female rat gives birth, thanks to a hypothalamic circuit with markedly different
functions in females and males. Moreover, the ventral tegmentum increases its
sensitivity to the neuropeptide by increasing levels of oxytocin receptors. Infuse
oxytocin into the brain of a virgin rat, and she’ll act maternally—retrieving,
grooming, and lick
