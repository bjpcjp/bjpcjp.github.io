Twelve
Hierarchy, Obedience, and
Resistance
t first glance, this chapter simply complements the previous one.
Us/Them-ing is about relations between groups and our automatic
tendency to favor in-groups over out-groups. Similarly, hierarchies are about a
type of relations within groups, our automatic tendency to favor people close in
rank to us over those who are distant. Other themes repeat as well—the
appearance of these tendencies early in life and in other species, and the
intertwined cognitive and affective underpinnings.
Moreover, Us/Them categorization and hierarchical position interact. In one
study subjects gave racial designations to pictures of racially ambiguous
individuals; those dressed in low-status attire were more likely to be categorized
as black, high-status attire, white.1 Thus, among these American subjects,
Us/Them dichotomizing by race and the hierarchy of socioeconomic status
overlap.
But as we’ll see, hierarchy heads in different directions from Us/Them-ing,
and in uniquely human ways: Like other hierarchical species, we have alpha
individuals, but unlike most others, we occasionally get to choose them.
Moreover, they often are not merely highest ranking but also “lead,” attempting
to maximize this thing called the common good. Furthermore, individuals vie for
leadership with differing visions of how best to attain that common good—
political ideologies. And finally, we express obedience both to an authority and
to the idea of Authority.
F
THE NATURE AND VARIETIES OF
HIERARCHIES
or starters, a hierarchy is a ranking system that formalizes unequal access to
limited resources, ranging from meat to that nebulous thing called
“prestige.” We begin by examining hierarchies in other species (with the proviso
that not all social species have hierarchies).
The textbook 1960s picture of hierarchies in other species was
straightforward. A group forms a stable, linear hierarchy where the alpha
individual dominates everyone, the beta individual dominates everyone except
the alpha, gamma everyone except alpha and beta, and so on.
Hierarchies establish a status quo by ritualizing inequalities. Two baboons
encounter something good—say, a spot shaded from the sun. Without stable
dominance relations, there’s a potentially injurious fight. Likewise over the figs
in a fruiting tree an hour later, and for the chance to be groomed by someone
after that, etc. Instead, fights rarely occur, and if a subordinate forgets his status,
a “threat yawn”—a ritualistic display of canines—from the dominant male
usually suffices.*,*2
Why have ranking systems? The answer, circa 1960s, was Marlin Perkins
group selection, where a species benefits from a stable social system in which
everyone knows their place. This view was fostered by the primatological belief
that in a hierarchy the alpha individual (i.e., the one who gets first dibs on
anything good) was in some manner a “leader” who does something useful for
the group. This was emphasized by the Harvard primatologist Irven DeVore,
who reported that among savanna baboons, the alpha male led the troop in each
day’s direction of foraging, led communal hunts, defended everyone against
lions, disciplined the kids, changed the lightbulbs, etc. This turned out to be
nonsense. Alpha males don’t know which direction to go (given that they
transfer into troops as adolescents). No one follows them anyway; instead
everyone follows the old females, who do know. Hunts are disorganized free-for-
alls. And an alpha male might face down a lion to protect a kid—if the kid is
probably his own. Otherwise, he’d grab the safest spot.
Male baboon giving a (hopefully) intimidating threat yawn.
When viewed without Perkins-colored glasses, the benefits of hierarchy are
individualistic. Interactions that proclaim the status quo obviously help the upper
crust. Meanwhile, for subordinates, better to not get a shady spot than to not get
it after receiving a canine slash. This is logical in a static, hereditary ranking
system. In systems where ranks change, this caution must be balanced with
occasionally challenging things—because the alpha male may be past his prime
and getting by on bluff.
This is a classic “pecking order” (a term derived from the hierarchical system
of hens). Variations begin. A first concern is whether there’s actually a hierarchy,
in the sense of gradations of rank. Instead, in some species (e.g., South American
marmoset monkeys) there’s the alpha and there’s everyone else, with fairly equal
relations.
In species with gradations, there’s the issue of what a “rank” actually means.
If your rank is number six in a hierarchy, in your mind are numbers one through
five interchangeable guys you’d better kowtow to, while seven through infinity
are undifferentiated peons? If so, it would be irrelevant to you if numbers two
and three, or numbers nine and ten, were having tensions; rank gradations would
be in the eyes of the primatologist, not the primate.
In reality, such primates think about gradations of rank. For example, a
baboon typically interacts differently with, say, the guy one step above him in
rank than the one five steps above. Furthermore, primates note gradations that
don’t directly concern them. Recall from chapter 10 how researchers recorded
vocalizations of individuals in a troop, splicing them to invent social scenarios.
Play a recording of number ten giving a dominance call and number one
responding with a subordination call, and everyone pays attention: whoa, Bill
Gates just panhandled a homeless guy.
This can be abstracted further, as shown with ravens, which are outrageously
smart birds. As with baboons, vocalizations implying dominance reversals
command more attention than does the status quo. Remarkably, this even occurs
for reversals between birds in a neighboring flock. Ravens discern dominance
relations just by listening and are interested in hierarchical gossip about a
different group.
Next is the issue of variation within and among species as to what life is like
having a particular rank. Does being high ranking merely mean that everyone
keeps tabs on your mood or, at the other extreme, that no one else is getting
enough calories to ovulate, lactate, or survive? How often do subordinates
challenge dominant individuals? How readily do dominant individuals vent their
frustrations on subordinates? How much do such subordinates have coping
outlets (e.g., someone to groom with)?
Then there is the issue of how high rank is attained. In many cases (e.g.,
female baboons, as noted) rank is inherited, a system with kin selection written
all over it. In contrast, in other species/sexes (male baboons, for example) ranks
shift over time, changing as a function of fights, showdowns, and Shakespearean
melodrama, where rising in the hierarchy is about brawn, sharp canines, and
winning the right fight.*
Hurrah for clawing your way to the top, for sweaty, zero-sum, muscular
capitalism. But what about the more interesting issue of how high rank, once
attained, is maintained? As we’ll see, this has less to do with muscle than with
social skills.
This ushers in a key point—social competence is challenging, and this is
reflected in the brain. The British anthropologist Robin Dunbar has shown that
across various taxa (e.g., “birds,” “ungulates” or “primates”), the bigger the
average size of the social group in the species, (a) the larger the brain, relative to
total body size, and (b) the larger the neocortex, relative to total brain size.
Dunbar’s influential “social brain hypothesis” posits that increases in social
complexity and the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex have been linked.
This link also occurs within species. Among some primates, group size can vary
tenfold (depending on the richness of the ecosystem). This was modeled in a
fascinating neuroimaging study, in which captive macaque monkeys were
housed in different-sized groups; the bigger the group, the more thickening of
the prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal gyrus, a cortical region involved
in Theory of Mind, and the tighter the activity coupling between the two.*3
Thus primate social complexity and big brains go together. This is shown
further by examining fission-fusion species, where the size of the social group
regularly changes dramatically. Baboons, for example, start and end the day in a
large, coherent troop, whereas midday foraging occurs in small groups. As other
examples, hyenas hunt in groups but scavenge individually, and wolves often do
the opposite.
Sociality is more complex in fission-fusion species. You must remember if
someone’s rank differs when in a subgroup versus the entire group. Being away
from someone all day makes it tempting to see if dominance relations have
changed since breakfast.
One study compared fission-fusion primates (chimps, bonobos, orangutans,
spider monkeys) and non-fission-fusion (gorillas, capuchins, long-tailed
macaques).4 Among these captive animals, fission-fusion species were better at
frontocortical tasks and had larger neocortices relative to total brain size. Studies
of corvids (crows, ravens, magpies, jackdaws) showed the same thing.
Thus “rank” and “hierarchy” in other animals is anything but straightforward
and varies considerably depending on the species, gender, and social group.
H
RANK AND HIERARCHY IN HUMANS
uman hierarchies resemble those of other species in many ways. For
example, there’s the distinction between stable and unstable hierarchies—
centuries of czarist rule versus the first inning of the Russian Revolution. As
we’ll see below, those situations evoke different patterns of brain activation.
Group size also matters—primate species with bigger social groups have
larger cortices relative to the rest of the brain (with humans topping off both
measures).5 If you graph the size of the neocortex against the average size of the
social group across primate species, you get “Dunbar’s number,” the predicted
average group size in traditional human cultures. It’s 150 people, and there’s
much evidence supporting that prediction.
This also plays out in the Western world, where the larger the size of
someone’s social network (often calculated by the number of e-mail/texting
relationships), the larger the vmPFC, orbital PFC, and amygdala, and the better
the person’s Theory of Mind–related skills.6
Do these brain regions expand when someone has a larger social network, or
do larger sizes of these regions predispose people toward forming larger
networks? Naturally, some of both.
As with other species, human quality of life also varies with the
consequences of rank inequalities—there’s a big difference between the
powerful getting seated at a restaurant before you and the powerful getting to
behead you if the fancy strikes them. Recall the study of thirty-seven countries
showing that the more income inequality, the more preadolescent bullying in
schools. In other words, countries with more brutal socioeconomic hierarchies
produce children who enforce their own hierarchies more brutally.7
Amid these cross-species similarities, there are unique things about humans,
including the following.
Membership in Multiple Hierarchies
We belong to multiple hierarchies and can have very different ranks in
them.* Naturally, this invites rationalization and system justification—deciding
why hierarchies where we flounder are crap and the one where we reign really
counts.
Implicit in being part of multiple hierarchies is their potential overlap.
Consider socioeconomic status, which encompasses both local and global
hierarchies. I’m doing great socioeconomically—my car’s fancier than yours.
I’m doing terribly—I’m not richer than Bill Gates.
The Specialization of Some Ranking Systems
A high-ranking chimp is generally good at related things. But humans can
dwell in incredibly specialized hierarchies. Example: There’s a guy named Joey
Chestnut who’s a god in one subculture—he’s the most successful competitive
hot dog eater in history. However, whether Chestnut’s gift generalizes to other
domains is unclear.
Internal Standards
This is the circumstance of having internal standards independent of the
outside world. As an example, winning or losing at a team sport generally
increases or decreases, respectively, testosterone levels in men. But things are
subtler than that—testosterone more closely tracks winning through skill (rather
than luck), and also more closely tracks individual (rather than team)
performance.8

Thus, as usual, we are just like other animals but totally different. We now
consider the biology of individual ranks.
THE VIEW FROM THE TOP, THE VIEW FROM
THE BOTTOM
Detecting Rank
Much as with our ability to detect Thems, we’re intensely interested in and
adept at spotting rank differences. For example, forty milliseconds is all we need
to reliably distinguish between a dominant face (with direct gaze) and a
subordinate one (with averted gaze and lowered eyebrows). Status is also
signaled in the body, albeit to a less accurate extent—dominance with an
exposed torso with arms wide open, subordination with arms sheltering a bent
torso, intent on invisibility. Again, we recognize those cues at automatic speeds.9
Human infants also recognize status differences, as shown in a truly clever
study. Show an infant a computer screen displaying a big square and little
square; each has eyes and a mouth.10 The two squares are at opposite ends of the
screen and repeatedly move to the other side, passing each other in the process.
Then show a version where the two bump into each other—conflict. The squares
bump repeatedly until one of them “gives in” by lying down, letting the other
one pass. Toddlers look at the interaction longer when it’s the big square that
gives in, rather than the little one. The first scenario is more interesting because
it violates expectations—“Hey, I thought big squares dominated little squares.”
Just like monkeys and corvids.
But wait, this may just reflect folk physics, not attunement to hierarchy—big
things knock over little things, not the other way around. This confound was
eliminated. First, the adversarial squares were not touching when one gave in.
Second, the subordinating one would fall in the opposite direction from that
predicted by physics—rather than being knocked backward, it prostrates itself
before the alpha square.
Along with this expertise comes intense interest in hierarchy—as
emphasized in chapter 9, gossip is mostly about the status of status: Are there
any fallen mighty? Have the meek inherited anything lately? Regardless of
which square wins, infants look longer at the conflict situation than when the
squares peacefully glide past each other.
This is logical self-interest. Knowing the hierarchical lay of the land helps
you navigate it better. But there’s more to that than just self-interest. Those
monkeys and corvids not only pay attention when there are rank reversals in
their group; they do the same when eavesdropping on the neighbors. Same with
us.11
What’s happening in our brains when we contemplate rank?12 Naturally, the
prefrontal cortex weighs in. Frontal damage impairs skill at recognizing
dominance relations (along with recognizing kinship, deception, or intimacy in
faces). The vlPFC and dlPFC activate and become coupled when we figure out
dominance relations or look at a dominant face, reflecting the combined
affective and cognitive components to the process. These responses are most
pronounced when considering someone of the opposite sex (which may reflect
mating goals more than mere academic interest about hierarchy).
Seeing a dominant face also activates the superior temporal gyrus (STG, with
its role in Theory of Mind) and increases its coupling to the PFC—we’re more
interested in what dominant individuals are thinking.13 Moreover, individual
“social status” neurons occur in the monkeys. And as noted in chapter 2,
contemplating an unstable hierarchy does all of the above, plus activates the
amygdala, reflecting the unsettling effects of instability. Of course, though, none
of this tells us what we are contemplating at these times.
Your Brain and Your Own Status
Your own rank does logical things to your brain. In macaque monkeys an
increase in rank increases mesolimbic dopamine signaling. And back to that
rhesus monkey study showing that being in a larger social group causes
expansion and functional coupling of the STG and PFC. The study also showed
that the higher the rank attained within each group, the greater the expansion and
coupling. Consistent with that, a study of mice showed that higher-ranking
animals had stronger excitatory inputs into the mouse equivalent of the
(cognitive) dlPFC.14
I love these findings. As I said, in lots of social species, attaining high rank is
about sharp teeth and good fighting skills. But maintaining the high rank is about
social intelligence and impulse control: knowing which provocations to ignore
and which coalitions to form, understanding other individuals’ actions.
Does the monkey make history, or does history make the monkey? Once
groups were formed, did individuals who became dominant respond with the
biggest expansions of those brain regions? Or, prior to group formation, were the
individuals destined to become dominant already endowed in those regions?
Unfortunately, animals weren’t imaged before and after group formation in
the study. However, subsequent work showed that the larger the size of the
group, the larger the association between dominance and those brain changes,
suggesting that attaining high rank drives the enlargement.* In contrast, the
mouse study showed that when synaptic excitability was increased or decreased
in the dlPFC, rank rose or declined, respectively, suggesting that enlargement
drives attainment of high rank. The brain can shape behavior can shape the brain
can shape . . .15
Your Body and Your Own Status
What about biological differences outside the brain as a function of rank?
For example, do high- and low-ranking males differ in their testosterone profiles
and, if there are differences, are they causes, consequences, or mere correlates of
the rank differences?
Folk endocrinology has always held that high rank (in any species) and
elevated testosterone levels go hand in hand, with the latter powering the former.
But as covered at length in chapter 4, neither is the case in primates. As a
reminder:
In stable hierarchies high-ranking males typically don’t have the
highest testosterone concentrations. Instead it’s usually low-
ranking adolescent males, starting fights they can’t finish. When
there is an association between high rank and high testosterone,
it generally reflects the higher rates of sexual behavior among
dominant individuals driving secretion.
An exception to the above is during unstable times. For
example, among a number of primate species, high-ranking
males have the highest testosterone levels for the first months
but not years after group formation. During unstable times, the
high-testosterone/high-rank relationship is more a consequence
of the high rates of fighting among the high-ranking cohort than
of rank itself.16
Reiterating the “challenge hypothesis,” the elevation in
testosterone levels caused by fighting is not so much about
aggression as about challenge. If status is maintained
aggressively, testosterone fosters aggression; if status were
maintained by writing beautiful, delicate haikus, testosterone
would foster that.
Next we consider the relationship between rank and stress. Are different
ranks associated with different levels of stress hormones, styles of coping, and
incidences of stress-related disease? Is it more stressful to be dominant or
subordinate?
An extensive literature shows that a sense of control and predictability
reduces stress. Yet monkey research conducted by Joseph Brady in 1958
produced a different view. Half the animals could press a bar to delay shocks
(“executive” monkeys); the passive other half
