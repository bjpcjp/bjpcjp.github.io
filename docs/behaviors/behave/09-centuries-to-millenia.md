Centuries to Millennia Before
et’s start with a seeming digression. Parts of chapters 4 and 7 have
debunked some supposed sex differences concerning the brain, hormones,
and behavior. One difference, however, is persistent. It’s far from issues that
concern this book, but bear with me.
A remarkably consistent finding, starting with elementary school students, is
that males are better at math than females. While the difference is minor when it
comes to considering average scores, there is a huge difference when it comes to
math stars at the upper extreme of the distribution. For example, in 1983, for
every girl scoring in the highest percentile on the math SAT, there were eleven
boys.
Why the difference? There have always been suggestions that testosterone is
central. During development, testosterone fuels the growth of a brain region
involved in mathematical thinking, and giving adults testosterone enhances some
math skills. Oh, okay, it’s biological.
But consider a paper published in Science in 2008.1 The authors examined
the relationship between math scores and sexual equality in forty countries
(based on economic, educational, and political indices of gender equality; the
worst was Turkey, the United States was middling, and, naturally, the
Scandinavians were tops). Lo and behold, the more gender equal the country, the
less of a discrepancy in math scores. By the time you get to the Scandinavian
countries, it’s statistically insignificant. And by the time you examine the most
gender-equal country on earth at the time, Iceland, girls are better at math than
boys.*

In other words, while you can never be certain, the Afghan girl pictured on
top, on the next page, seated next to her husband, is less likely than the Swedish
girl pictured below her to solve the Erdös-Hajnal conjecture in graph theory.
In other, other words, culture matters. We carry it with us wherever we go.
As one example, the level of corruption—a government’s lack of transparency
regarding use of power and finances—in UN diplomats’ home countries predicts
their likelihood of racking up unpaid parking tickets in Manhattan. Culture
leaves long-lasting residues—Shiites and Sunnis slaughter each other over a
succession issue fourteen centuries old; across thirty-three countries population
density in the year 1500 significantly predicts how authoritarian the government
was in 2000; over the course of millennia, earlier adoption of the hoe over the
plow predicts gender equality today.2
And in other, other, other words, when we contemplate our iconic acts—the
pulling of a trigger, the touching of an arm—and want to explain why they
happened using a biological framework, culture better be on our list of
explanatory factors.
Thus, the goals of this chapter:
Look at systematic patterns of cultural variation as they pertain
to the best and worst of our behaviors.
Explore how different types of brains produce different culture
and different types of culture produce different brains. In other
words, how culture and biology coevolve.3

“C
DEFINITIONS, SIMILARITIES, AND
DIFFERENCES
ulture,” naturally, has been defined various ways. One influential
definition comes from Edward Tylor, a distinguished nineteenth-
century cultural anthropologist. For him culture is “that complex whole which
includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities
and habits acquired by man [sic] as a member of society.”4
This definition, obviously, is oriented toward something that is specific to
humans. Jane Goodall blew off everyone’s socks in the 1960s by reporting the
now-iconic fact that chimps make tools. Her study subjects modified twigs by
stripping off the leaves and pushing them into termite mounds; termites would
bite the twig, still holding on when it was pulled out, yielding a snack for the
chimps.
This was just the start. Chimps were subsequently found to use various tools
—wood or rock anvils for cracking open nuts, wads of chewed leaves to sponge
up hard-to-reach water, and, in a real shocker, sharpened sticks for spearing bush
babies.5 Different populations make different tools; new techniques spread
across social networks (among chimps who hang with one another); kids learn
the ropes by watching their moms; techniques spread from one group to another
when someone emigrates; chimp nut-cracking tools in excess of four thousand
years old have been excavated. And in my favorite example, floating between
tool use and accessorizing, a female in Zambia got it into her head to go around
with a strawlike blade of grass in her ear. The action had no obvious function;
apparently she just liked having a piece of grass sticking out of her ear. So sue
her. She did it for years, and over that time the practice spread throughout her
group. A fashionista.
In the decades since Goodall’s discovery, tool use has been observed in apes
and monkeys, elephants, sea otters, mongoose.6 Dolphins use sea sponges to dig
up fish burrowed into the sea floor. Birds use tools for nest building or food
acquisition—jays and crows, for example, use twigs to fish for insects, much as
chimps do. And there’s tool use in cephalopods, reptiles, and fish.
E. van Leeuwen et al., “A Group-Specific Arbitrary Tradition in Chimpanzees (Pan
troglodytes),” Animal Cog 17 (2014): 1421.
All this is mighty impressive. Nonetheless, such cultural transmission
doesn’t show progression—this year’s chimp nut-cracking tool is pretty much
the same as that of four thousand years ago. And with few exceptions (more
later), nonhuman culture is solely about material culture (versus, say, social
organization).
So the classical definition of culture isn’t specific to humans.7 Most cultural
anthropologists weren’t thrilled with Goodall’s revolution—great, next the
zoologists will report that Rafiki persuaded Simba to become the Lion King—
and now often emphasize definitions of culture that cut chimps and other hoi
polloi out of the party. There’s a fondness for the thinking of Alfred Kroeber,
Clyde Kluckhohn, and Clifford Geertz, three heavyweight social anthropologists
who focused on how culture is about ideas and symbols, rather than the mere
behaviors in which they instantiate, or material products like flint blades or
iPhones. Contemporary anthropologists like Richard Shweder have emphasized
a more affective but still human-centric view of culture as being about moral and
visceral versions of right and wrong. And of course these views have been
critiqued by postmodernists for reasons I can’t begin to follow.
Basically, I don’t want to go anywhere near these debates. For our purposes
we’ll rely on an intuitive definition of culture that has been emphasized by Frans
de Waal: “culture” is how we do and think about things, transmitted by
nongenetic means.
Working with that broad definition, is the most striking thing about the array
of human cultures the similarities or the differences? Depends on your taste.
If the similarities seem most interesting, there are plenty—after all, multiple
groups of humans independently invented agriculture, writing, pottery,
embalming, astronomy, and coinage. At the extreme of similarities are human
universals, and numerous scholars have proposed lists of them. One of the
lengthiest and most cited comes from the anthropologist Donald Brown.8 Here’s
a partial list of his proposed cultural universals: the existence of and concern
with aesthetics, magic, males and females seen as having different natures, baby
talk, gods, induction of altered states, marriage, body adornment, murder,
prohibition of some type of murder, kinship terms, numbers, cooking, private
sex, names, dance, play, distinctions between right and wrong, nepotism,
prohibitions on certain types of sex, empathy, reciprocity, rituals, concepts of
fairness, myths about afterlife, music, color terms, prohibitions, gossip, binary
sex terms, in-group favoritism, language, humor, lying, symbolism, the linguistic
concept of “and,” tools, trade, and toilet training. And that’s a partial list.
For the purposes of this chapter, the staggeringly large cultural differences in
how life is experienced, in resources and privileges available, in opportunities
and trajectories, are most interesting. Just to start with some breathtaking
demographic statistics born of cultural differences: a girl born in Monaco has a
ninety-three-year life expectancy; one in Angola, thirty-nine. Latvia has 99.9
percent literacy; Niger, 19 percent. More than 10 percent of children in
Afghanistan die in their first year, about 0.2 percent in Iceland. Per-capita GDP
is $137,000 in Qatar, $609 in the Central African Republic. A woman in South
Sudan is roughly a thousand times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman
in Estonia.9
The experience of violence also varies enormously by culture. Someone in
Honduras is 450 times more likely to be murdered than someone in Singapore.
65 percent of women experience intimate-partner violence in Central Africa, 16
percent in East Asia. A South African woman is more than one hundred times
more likely to be raped than one in Japan. Be a school kid in Romania, Bulgaria,
or Ukraine, and you’re about ten times more likely to be chronically bullied than
a kid in Sweden, Iceland, or Denmark (stay tuned for a closer look at this).10
Of course, there are the well-known gender-related cultural differences.
There are the Scandinavian countries approaching total gender equality and
Rwanda, with 63 percent of its lower-house parliamentary seats filled by women,
compared with Saudi Arabia, where women are not allowed outside the house
unless accompanied by a male guardian, and Yemen, Qatar, and Tonga, with 0
percent female legislators (and with the United States running around 20
percent).11
Then there’s the Philippines, where 93 percent of people say they feel happy
and loved, versus 29 percent of Armenians. In economic games, people in
Greece and Oman are more likely to spend resources to punish overly generous
players than to punish those who are cheaters, whereas among Australians such
“antisocial punishment” is nonexistent. And there are wildly different criteria for
prosocial behavior. In a study of employees throughout the world working for
the same multinational bank, what was the most important reason cited to help
someone? Among Americans it was that the person had previously helped them;
for Chinese it was that the person was higher ranking; in Spain, that they were a
friend or acquaintance.12
Your life will be unrecognizably different, depending on which culture the
stork deposited you into. In wading through this variability, there are some
pertinent patterns, contrasts, and dichotomies.
A
COLLECTIVIST VERSUS INDIVIDUALIST
CULTURES
s introduced in chapter 7, a large percentage of cross-cultural psychology
studies compare collectivist with individualist cultures. This almost
always means comparisons between subjects from collectivist East Asian
cultures and Americans, coming from that mother of all individualist cultures.*
As defined, collectivist cultures are about harmony, interdependence,
conformity, and having the needs of the group guiding behavior, whereas
individualist cultures are about autonomy, personal achievement, uniqueness,
and the needs and rights of the individual. Just to be a wee bit caustic,
individualist culture can be summarized by that classic American concept of
“looking out for number one”; collectivist culture can be summarized by the
archetypical experience of American Peace Corps teachers in such countries—
pose your students a math question, and no one will volunteer the correct answer
because they don’t want to stand out and shame their classmates.
Individualist/collectivist contrasts are striking. In individualist cultures,
people more frequently seek uniqueness and personal accomplishment, use first-
person singular pronouns more often, define themselves in terms that are
personal (“I’m a contractor”) rather than relational (“I’m a parent”), attribute
their successes to intrinsic attributes (“I’m really good at X”) rather than to
situational ones (“I was in the right place at the right time”). The past is more
likely to be remembered via events (“That’s the summer I learned to swim”)
rather than social interactions (“That’s the summer we became friends”).
Motivation and satisfaction are gained from self- rather than group-derived effort
(reflecting the extent to which American individualism is about noncooperation,
rather than nonconformity). Competitive drive is about getting ahead of
everyone else. When asked to draw a “sociogram”—a diagram of their social
network, with circles representing themselves and their friends, connected by
lines—Americans tend to place the circle representing themselves in the middle
of the page and make it the largest.13
In contrast, those from collectivist cultures show more social comprehension;
some reports suggest that they are better at Theory of Mind tasks, more accurate
in understanding someone else’s perspective—with “perspective” ranging from
the other person’s abstract thoughts to how objects appear from where she is
sitting. There is more blame of the group when someone violates a norm due to
peer pressure, and a greater tendency to give situational explanations for
behavior. Competitive drive is about not falling behind everyone else. And when
drawing sociograms, the circle representing “yourself” is far from the center, and
far from the biggest.
Naturally, these cultural differences have biological correlates. For example,
subjects from individualist cultures strongly activate the (emotional) mPFC
when looking at a picture of themselves, compared to looking at a picture of a
relative or friend; in contrast, the activation is far less for East Asian subjects.*
Another example is a favorite demonstration of mine of cross-cultural
differences in psychological stress—when asked in free recall, Americans are
more likely than East Asians to remember times in which they influenced
someone; conversely, East Asians are more likely to remember times when
someone influenced them. Force Americans to talk at length about a time
someone influenced them, or force East Asians to detail their influencing
someone, and both secrete glucocorticoids from the stressfulness of having to
recount this discomfiting event. And work by my Stanford colleagues and
friends Jeanne Tsai and Brian Knutson shows that mesolimbic dopamine systems
activate in European Americans when looking at excited facial expressions; in
Chinese, when looking at calm expressions.
As we will see in chapter 13, these cultural differences produce different
moral systems. In the most traditional of collectivist societies, conformity and
morality are virtually synonymous and norm enforcement is more about shame
(“What will people think if I did that?”) than guilt (“How could I live with
myself?”). Collectivist cultures foster more utilitarian and consequentialist moral
stances (for example, a greater willingness for an innocent person to be jailed in
order to prevent a riot). The tremendous collectivist emphasis on the group
produces a greater degree of in-group bias than among individualist culture
members. In one study, for example, Korean and European American subjects
observed pictures of either in- or out-group members in pain. All subjects
reported more subjective empathy and showed more activation of Theory of
Mind brain regions (i.e., the temporoparietal junction) when observing in-group
members, but the bias was significantly greater among Korean subjects. In
addition, subjects from both individualist and collectivist cultures denigrate out-
group members, but only the former inflate assessments of their own group. In
other words, East Asians, unlike Americans, don’t have to puff up their own
group to view others as inferior.14
What is fascinating is the direction that some of these differences take, as
shown in approaches pioneered by one of the giants in this field, Richard Nisbett
of the University of Michigan. Westerners problem-solve in a more linear
fashion, with more reliance on linguistic rather than spatial coding. When asked
to explain the movement of a ball, East Asians are more likely to invoke
relational explanations built around the interactions of the ball with its
environment—friction—while Westerners focus on intrinsic properties like
weight and density. Westerners are more accurate at estimating length in absolute
terms (“How long is that line?”) while East Asians are better with relational
estimates (“How much longer is this line than that?”). Or how’s this one:
Consider a monkey, a bear, and a banana. Which two go together? Westerners
think categorically and choose the monkey and bear—they’re both animals. East
Asians think relationally and link the monkey and banana—if you’re thinking of
a monkey, also think of food it will need.15
Remarkably, the cultural differences extend to sensory processing, where
Westerners process information in a more focused manner, East Asians in a more
holistic one.16 Show a picture of a person standing in the middle of a complex
scene; East Asians will be more accurate at remembering the scene, the context,
while Westerners remember the person in the middle. Remarkably, this is even
observed on the level of eye tracking—typically Westerners’ eyes first look at a
picture’s center, while East Asians scan the overall scene. Moreover, force
Westerners to focus on the holistic context of a picture, or East Asians on the
central subject, and the frontal cortex works harder, activating more.
As covered in chapter 7, cultural values are first inculcated early in life. So
it’s no surprise that culture shapes our attitudes about success, morality,
happiness, love, and so on. But what is startling to me is how these cultural
differences also shape where your eyes focus on a picture or how you think
about monkeys and bananas or the physics of a ball’s trajectory. Culture’s impact
is enormous.
Naturally, there are various caveats concerning collectivist/individualist
comparisons:
The most obvious is the perpetual “on the average”—there are
plenty of Westerners, for example, who are more collectivist
than plenty of East Asians. In general, people who are most
individualist by various personality measures are most
individualist in neuroimaging studies.17
Cultures change over time. For example, levels of conformity in
East Asian cultures are declining (one study, for example, shows
increased rates of babies in Japan receiving unique names).
Moreover, one’s degree of inculcation into one’s culture can be
altered rapidly. For example, priming someone beforehand with
individualist or collectivist cultural cues shifts how holistically
he processes a picture. This is especially true for bicultural
individuals.18
We will soon see about some genetic differences between
collectivist and individualist populations. There is nothing
resembling genetic destiny about this—the best evidence for this
conclusion comes from one of the control groups in many of
these studies, namely East Asian Americans. In general, it takes
about a generation for the descendants of East Asian immigrants
to America to be as individualist as European Americans.19
Obviously, “East Asians” and “Westerners” are not monolithic
entities. Just ask someone from Beijing versus the Tibetan
steppes. Or stick three people from Berkeley, Brooklyn, and
Biloxi in a stalled elevator for a few hours and see what
happens. As we will see, there is striking variation within
cultures.
Why should people in one part of the globe have developed collectivist
cultures, while others went individualist? The United States is the individualism
poster child for at least two reasons. First there’s immigration. Currently, 12
percent of Americans
