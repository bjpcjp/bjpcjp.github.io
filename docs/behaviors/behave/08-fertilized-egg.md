Back to When You Were Just
a Fertilized Egg
’m reminded of a cartoon where one lab-coated scientist is telling the other,
“You know how you’re on the phone, and the other person wants to get off
but won’t say it, so they say, ‘Well, you probably need to get going,’ like you’re
the one who wants to get off, when it’s really them? I think I found the gene for
that.”
This chapter is about progress in finding “the gene for that.”
—
Our prototypical behavior has occurred. How was it influenced by events when
the egg and sperm that formed that person joined, creating their genome—the
chromosomes, the sequences of DNA—destined to be duplicated in every cell in
that future person’s body? What role did those genes play in causing that
behavior?
Genes are relevant to, say, aggression, which is why we’re less alarmed if a
toddler pulls at the ears of a basset hound rather than a pit bull. Genes are
relevant to everything in this book. Many neurotransmitters and hormones are
coded for by genes. As are molecules that construct or degrade those
messengers, as are their receptors. Ditto for growth factors guiding brain
plasticity. Genes typically come in different versions; we each consist of an
individuated orchestration of the different versions of our approximately twenty
thousand genes.
This topic carries two burdens. The first reflects many people being troubled
by linking genes with behavior—in one incident from my academic youth, a
federally funded conference was canceled for suggesting that genes were
pertinent to violence. This suspicion of gene/behavior links exists because of the
pseudoscientific genetics used to justify various “isms,” prejudice, and
discrimination. Such pseudoscience has fostered racism and sexism, birthed
eugenics and forced sterilizations, allowed scientifically meaningless versions of
words like “innate” to justify the neglect of have-nots. And monstrous
distortions of genetics have fueled those who lynch, ethnically cleanse, or march
children into gas chambers.*1
But studying the genetics of behavior also carries the opposite burden of
people who are overly enthusiastic about the subject. After all, this is the
genomics era, with personalized genomic medicine, people getting their
genomes sequenced, and popular writing about genomics giddy with terms like
“the holy grail” and “the code of codes.” In a reductionist view, understanding
something complex requires breaking it down into its components; understand
those parts, add them together, and you’ll understand the big picture. And in this
reductionist world, to understand cells, organs, bodies, and behavior, the best
constituent part to study is genes.
Overenthusiasm for genes can reflect a sense that people possess an
immutable, distinctive essence (although essentialism predates genomics).
Consider a study concerning “moral spillover” based on kinship.2 Suppose a
person harmed people two generations ago; are this person’s grandchildren
obliged to help his victims’ grandchildren? Subjects viewed a biological
grandchild as more obligated than one adopted into the family at birth; the
biological relationship carried a taint. Moreover, subjects were more willing to
jail two long-lost identical twins for a crime committed by one of them than to
jail two unrelated but perfect look-alikes—the former, raised in different
environments, share a moral taint because of their identical genes. People see
essentialism embedded in bloodlines—i.e., genes.*
This chapter threads between these two extremes, concluding that while
genes are important to this book’s concerns, they’re far less so than often
thought. The chapter first introduces gene function and regulation, showing the
limits of genes’ power. Next it examines genetic influences on behavior in
general. Finally we’ll examine genetic influences on our best and worst
behaviors.

PART I: GENES FROM THE BOTTOM UP
e start by considering the limited power of genes. If you are shaky about
topics such as the central dogma (DNA codes for RNA, which codes for
protein sequence), protein structure determining function, the three-nucleotide
codon code, or the basics of point, insertion, and deletion mutations, first read
the primer in appendix 3.
Do Genes Know What They Are Doing? The Triumph of
the Environment
So genes specify protein structure, shape, and function. And since proteins
do virtually everything, this makes DNA the holy grail of life. But no—genes
don’t “decide” when a new protein is made.
Dogma was that there’d be a stretch of DNA in a chromosome, constituting a
single gene, followed by a stop codon, followed immediately by the next gene,
and then the next. . . . But genes don’t actually come one after another—not all
DNA constitutes genes. Instead there are stretches of DNA between genes that
are noncoding, that are not “transcribed.”* And now a flabbergasting number—
95 percent of DNA is noncoding. Ninety-five percent.
What is that 95 percent? Some is junk—remnants of pseudogenes inactivated
by evolution.*3 But buried in that are the keys to the kingdom, the instruction
manual for when to transcribe particular genes, the on/off switches for gene
transcription. A gene doesn’t “decide” when to be photocopied into RNA, to
generate its protein. Instead, before the start of the stretch of DNA coding for
that gene is a short stretch called a promoter*—the “on” switch. What turns the
promoter switch on? Something called a transcription factor (TF) binds to the
promoter. This causes the recruitment of enzymes that transcribe the gene into
RNA. Meanwhile, other transcription factors deactivate genes.
This is huge. Saying that a gene “decides” when it is transcribed* is like
saying that a recipe decides when a cake is baked.
Thus transcription factors regulate genes. What regulates transcription
factors? The answer devastates the concept of genetic determinism: the
environment.
To start unexcitingly, “environment” can mean intracellular environment.
Suppose a hardworking neuron is low on energy. This state activates a particular
transcription factor, which binds to a specific promoter, which activates the next
gene in line (the “downstream” gene). This gene codes for a glucose transporter;
more glucose transporter proteins are made and inserted into the cell membrane,
improving the neuron’s ability to access circulating glucose.
Next consider “environment,” including the neuron next door, which releases
serotonin onto the neuron in question. Suppose less serotonin has been released
lately. Sentinel transcription factors in dendritic spines sense this, travel to the
DNA, and bind to the promoter upstream of the serotonin receptor gene. More
receptor is made and placed in the dendritic spines, and they become more
sensitive to the faint serotonin signal.
Sometimes “environment” can be far-flung within an organism. A male
secretes testosterone, which travels through the bloodstream and binds to
androgen receptors in muscle cells. This activates a transcription-factor cascade
that results in more intracellular scaffolding proteins, enlarging the cell (i.e.,
muscle mass increases).
Finally, and most important, there is “environment,” meaning the outside
world. A female smells her newborn, meaning that odorant molecules that
floated off the baby bind to receptors in her nose. The receptors activate and
(many steps later in the hypothalamus) a transcription factor activates, leading to
the production of more oxytocin. Once secreted, the oxytocin causes milk
letdown. Genes are not the deterministic holy grail if they can be regulated by
the smell of a baby’s tushy. Genes are regulated by all the incarnations of
environment.
In other words, genes don’t make sense outside the context of environment.
Promoters and transcription factor introduce if/then clauses: “If you smell your
baby, then activate the oxytocin gene.”
Now the plot thickens.
There are multiple types of transcription factors in a cell, each binding to a
particular DNA sequence constituting a particular promoter.
Consider a genome containing one gene. In that imaginary organism there is
only a single profile of transcription (i.e., the gene is transcribed), requiring only
one transcription factor.
Now consider a genome consisting of genes A and B, meaning three different
transcription profiles—A is transcribed, B is transcribed, A and B are transcribed
—requiring three different TFs (assuming you activate only one at a time).
Three genes, seven transcription profiles: A, B, C, A + B, A + C, B + C, A +
B + C. Seven different TFs.
Four genes, fifteen profiles. Five genes, thirty-one profiles.*
As the number of genes in a genome increases, the number of possible
expression profiles increases exponentially. As does the number of TFs needed
to produce those profiles.
Now another wrinkle that, in the lingo of an ancient generation, will blow
your mind.
TFs are usually proteins, coded for by genes. Back to genes A and B. To
fully exploit them, you need the TF that activates gene A, and the TF that
activates gene B, and the TF that activates genes A and B. Thus there must exist
three more genes, each coding for one of those TFs. Requiring TFs that activate
those genes. And TFs for the genes coding for those TFs . . .
Whoa. Genomes aren’t infinite; instead TFs regulate one another’s
transcription, solving that pesky infinity problem. Importantly, across the species
whose genomes have been sequenced, the longer the genome (i.e., roughly the
more genes there are), the greater the percentage of genes coding for TFs. In
other words, the more genomically complex the organism, the larger the
percentage of the genome devoted to gene regulation by the environment.
Back to mutations. Can there be mutations in DNA stretches constituting
promoters? Yes, and more often than in genes themselves. In the 1970s Allan
Wilson and Mary-Claire King at Berkeley correctly theorized that the evolution
of genes is less important than the evolution of regulatory sequences upstream of
genes (and thus how the environment regulates genes). Reflecting that, a
disproportionate share of genetic differences between chimps and humans are in
genes for TFs.
Time for more complexity. Suppose you have genes 1–10, and transcription
factors A, B, and C. TF-A induces the transcription of genes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
TF-B induces genes 1, 2, 5, and 6. TF-C induces 1, 5, and 10. Thus, upstream of
gene 1 are separate promoters responding to TFs A, B, and C—thus genes can be
regulated by multiple TFs. Conversely, each TF usually activates more than one
gene, meaning that multiple genes are typically activated in networks (for
example, cell injury causes a TF called NF-κB to activate a network of
inflammation genes). Suppose the promoter upstream of gene 3 that responds to
promoter TF-A has a mutation making it responsive to TF-B. Result? Gene 3 is
now activated as part of a different network. Same networkwide outcome if there
is a mutation in a gene for a TF, producing a protein that binds to a different
promoter type.4
Consider this: the human genome codes for about 1,500 different TFs,
contains 4,000,000 TF-binding sites, and the average cell uses about 200,000
such sites to generate its distinctive gene-expression profile.5 This is boggling.
Epigenetics
The last chapter introduced the phenomenon of environmental influences
freezing genetic on/off in one position. Such “epigenetic” changes* were
relevant to events, particularly in childhood, causing persistent effects on the
brain and behavior. For example, recall those pair-bonding prairie voles; when
females and males first mate, there are epigenetic changes in regulation of
oxytocin and vasopressin receptor genes in the nucleus accumbens, that target of
mesolimbic dopamine projection.6
Let’s translate the last chapter’s imagery of “freezing on/off switches” into
molecular biology.7 What mechanisms underlie epigenetic changes in gene
regulation? An environmental input results in a chemical being attached tightly
to a promoter, or to some nearby structural proteins surrounding DNA. The
result of either is that TFs can no longer access or properly bind to the promoter,
thus silencing the gene.
As emphasized in the last chapter, epigenetic changes can be
multigenerational.8 Dogma was that all the epigenetic marks (i.e., changes in the
DNA or surrounding proteins) were erased in eggs and sperm. But it turns out
that epigenetic marks can be passed on by both (e.g., make male mice diabetic,
and they pass the trait to their offspring via epigenetic changes in sperm).
Recall one of the great punching bags of science history, the eighteenth-
century French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.9 All anybody knows about the
guy now is that he was wrong about heredity. Suppose a giraffe habitually
stretches her neck to reach leaves high in a tree; this lengthens her neck.
According to Lamarck, when she has babies, they will have longer necks
because of “acquired inheritance.”* Lunatic! Buffoon! Epigenetically mediated
mechanisms of inheritance—now often called “neo-Lamarckian inheritance”—
prove Lamarck right in this narrow domain. Centuries late, the guy’s getting
some acclaim.
Thus, not only does environment regulate genes, but it can do so with effects
that last days to lifetimes.
The Modular Construction of Genes: Exons and Introns
Time to do in another dogma about DNA. It turns out that most genes are not
coded for by a continuous stretch of DNA. Instead there might be a stretch of
noncoding DNA in the middle. In that case, the two separate stretches of coding
DNA are called “exons,” separated by an “intron.” Many genes are broken into
numerous exons (with, logically, one less intron than the number of exons).
How do you produce a protein from an “exonic” gene? The RNA photocopy
of the gene initially contains the exons and introns; an enzyme removes the
intronic parts and splices together the exons. Clunky, but with big implications.
Back to each particular gene coding for a particular protein.10 Introns and
exons destroy this simplicity. Imagine a gene consisting of exons 1, 2, and 3,
separated by introns A and B. In one part of the body a splicing enzyme exists
that splices out the introns and also trashes exon 3, producing a protein coded for
by exons 1 and 2. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the body, a different splicing enzyme
jettisons exon 2 along with the introns, producing a protein derived from exons 1
and 3. In another cell type a protein is made solely from exon 1. . . . Thus
“alternative splicing” can generate multiple unique proteins from a single stretch
of DNA; so much for “one gene specifies one protein”—this gene specifies
seven (A, B, C, A-B, A-C, B-C, and A-B-C). Remarkably, 90 percent of human
genes with exons are alternatively spliced. Moreover, when a gene is regulated
by multiple TFs, each can direct the transcription of a different combination of
exons. Oh, and splicing enzymes are proteins, meaning that each is coded for by
a gene. Loops and loops.
Transposable Genetic Elements, the Stability of the
Genome, and Neurogenesis
Time to unmoor another cherished idea, namely that genes inherited from
your parents (i.e., what you started with as a fertilized egg) are immutable. This
calls up a great chapter of science history. In the 1940s an accomplished plant
geneticist named Barbara McClintock observed something impossible. She was
studying the inheritance of kernel color in maize (a frequent tool of geneticists)
and found patterns of mutations unexplained by any known mechanism. The
only possibility, she concluded, was that stretches of DNA had been copied, with
the copy then randomly inserted into another stretch of DNA.
Yeah, right.
Clearly McClintock, with her (derisively named) “jumping genes,” had gone
mad, and so she was ignored (not exactly true, but this detracts from the drama).
She soldiered on in epic isolation. And finally, with the molecular revolution of
the 1970s, she was vindicated about her (now termed) transposable genetic
elements, or transposons. She was lionized, canonized, Nobel Prized (and was
wonderfully inspirational, as disinterested in acclaim as in her ostracism,
working until her nineties).
Transpositional events rarely produce great outcomes. Consider a
hypothetical stretch of DNA coding for “The fertilized egg is implanted in the
uterus.”
There has been a transpositional event, where the underlined stretch of
message was copied and randomly plunked down elsewhere: “The fertilized
eggterus is implanted in the uterus.”
Gibberish.
But sometimes “The fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus” becomes “The
fertilized eggplant is implanted in the uterus.”
Now, that’s not an everyday occurrence.
—
Plants utilize transposons. Suppose there is a drought; plants can’t move to
wetter pastures like animals can. Plant “stress” such as drought induces
transpositions in particular cells, where the plant metaphorically shuffles its
DNA deck, hoping to generate some novel savior of a protein.
Mammals have fewer transposons than plants. The immune system is one
transposon hot spot, in the enormous stretches of DNA coding for antibodies. A
novel virus invades; shuffling the DNA increases the odds of coming up with an
antibody that will target the invader.*
The main point here is that transposons occur in the brain.11 In humans
transpositional events occur in stem cells in the brain when they are becoming
neurons, making the brain a mosaic of neurons with different DNA sequences. In
other words, when you make neurons, that boring DNA sequence you inherited
isn’t good enough. Remarkably, transpositional events occur in neurons that
form memories in fruit flies. Even flies evolved such that their neurons are freed
from the strict genetic marching orders they inherit.
Chance
Finally, chance lessens genes as the Code of Codes. Chance, driven by
Brownian motion—the random movement of particles in a fluid—has big effects
on tiny things like molecules floating in cells, including molecules regulating
gene transcription.12 This influences how quickly an activated TF reaches the
DNA, splicing enzymes bump into target stretches of RNA, and an enzyme
synthesizing something grabs the two precursor molecules needed for the
synthesis. I’ll stop here; otherwise, I’ll go on for hours.
Some Key Points, Completing This Part of the Chapter
a. Genes are not autonomous agents commanding biological
events.
b. Instead, genes are regulated by the environment, with
“environment” consisting of everything from events inside the
cell to the universe.
c. Much of your DNA turns environmental influences into gene
transcription, rather than coding for genes themselves;
moreover, evolution is heavily about changing regulation of
gene transcription, rather than genes themselves.
d. Epigenetics can allow environmental effects to be lifelong, or
even multigenerational.
e. And thanks to transposons, neurons contain a mosaic of
different genomes.
In other words, genes don’t determine much. This theme continues as we
focus on the effects of genes on behavior.

PART 2: GENES FROM THE TOP DOWN—
BEHAVIOR GENETICS
ong before anything was known about promoters, exons, or transcription
factors, it became clear that you study genetics top down, by observing
traits shared by relatives. Early in the last century, this emerged as the science of
“behavior genetics.” As we’ll see, the field has often been mired in controversy,
typically because of disagreements over the magnitude of genetic effects on
things like IQ or sexual orientation.
First Attempts
The field began with the primitive idea that, if everyone in a family does it, it
must be genetic. This was confounded by environment running in families as
well.
The next approach depended on closer relatives having more genes in
common than distant ones. Thus, if a trait runs in a family and is more common
among closer relatives, it’s genetic. But obviously, closer relatives share more
environment as well—think of a child and par
