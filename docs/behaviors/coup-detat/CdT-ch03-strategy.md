Chapter 3
The Strategy of the Coup d’État
Dean Acheson used to tell a story about Chief Justice Taft relating a conversation he had just had with
an eminent man about the “machinery of government.” “And you know”—Taft said with wonder in his
voice—“he really did believe that it is machinery.”
—Roger Hilsman, To Move a Nation
Under totalitarian conditions knowledge of the labyrinth of transmission belts [of the machinery of
government] equals supreme power.
—Hannah Arendt (wrong, as usual), in The Origins of Totalitarianism
Overthrowing governments is not easy. The government will not only be
protected by the professional defenses of the state—the armed forces, the police,
and the security services—but it will also be supported by a whole range of
political forces. In a sophisticated and democratic society, these forces will
include political parties, sectional interests, and regional, ethnic, and religious
groupings. Their interaction—and mutual opposition—results in a particular
balance of forces that the government in some way represents.a In less
sophisticated societies, there may be a narrower range of such forces, but there
will almost always be some political groups that support the status quo and,
therefore, the government.
If those who carry out the coup appear to shatter such a powerful structure
merely by seizing a few buildings and arresting some political figures, it is
because their crucial achievement passes unnoticed. This is the dangerous and
elaborate process by which the armed forces and the other means of coercion are
neutralized before the coup, and the political forces are temporarily forced into
passivity. If we were revolutionaries seeking to change the structure of society,
our aim would be to destroy the power of some of the political forces; the long
and often bloody process of revolutionary attrition can achieve this. Our
purpose, however, is quite different: we want to seize power within the present
system, and we shall only stay in power if we embody some new status quo
supported by those very forces that a revolution may seek to destroy. Should we
want to achieve fundamental social change, we can do so after we have become
the government. This is perhaps a more efficient method (and certainly a less
painful one) than that of classic revolution.
Though we will try to avoid all conflict with the “political” forces, some of
them will almost certainly oppose a coup. But this opposition will largely
subside when we have substituted our new status quo for the old one and can
enforce it by our control of the state bureaucracy and security forces. A period of
transition such as this, which comes after we have emerged into the open and
before we are vested with the authority of the state, is the most critical phase of
the coup. We shall then be carrying out the dual task of imposing our control on
the machinery of state, while simultaneously using it to impose our control on
the country at large. Any resistance to the coup in the one will stimulate further
resistance in the other; if a chain reaction develops, the coup could be defeated.
Our strategy, therefore, must be guided by two principal considerations: the
need for maximum speed in the transitional phase, and the need to fully
neutralize the opposition both before and immediately after the coup. If, in the
operational phase of the coup, we are at any stage delayed, then our essential
weakness will emerge: we will likely acquire a political coloration, and this, in
turn, will lead to a concentration of those forces that oppose the tendency we
represent (or are thought to represent). As long as the execution of the coup is
rapid, and we are cloaked in anonymity, no particular political faction will have
a motive or an opportunity to oppose us. After all, we could be their potential
allies. In any case, a delay will cost us our principal advantage: the voluntary
neutrality of the “wait and see” elements, and the involuntary neutrality of those
forces that require time to concentrate and deploy for action.
The need for maximum speed means that the many separate operations of the
coup must be carried out almost simultaneously—necessarily requiring the
efforts of a large number of people. Therefore, assuming that we start the
planning of the coup with only a small group of political associates, most of the
personnel we will need must be recruited. Furthermore, our recruits must have
the training and equipment that will enable them to take swift and determined
action. There will usually be only one source of such recruits: the armed forces
of the state itself.
Because ethnic minorities are often both antigovernment and warlike some
may believe that they are ideal recruits for a coup. That has been true of the
Alawites and Druzes of Syria, the Kurds of Iraq, and the Shans of Burma. But in
most cases, a coup identi fied with minorities is likely to arouse nationalist
reactions on the part of the majority peoples. Since the centers of government are
usually located in the majority areas, their opposition would be a further
important obstacle for us.
Another possible substitute for the subversion of the forces of the state is the
organization of a party militia. When there is a combination of political freedom
with an ineffectual maintenance of law and order, such militias are sometimes
formed in order to “protect” party activities. In Weimar Germany, for example,
apart from the Nazi Sturmabteilung (assault detachments, or “Brownshirts”),
there were party militias of the Social Democrats, Communists, and the right-
wing nationalist parties. Similar organizations—Blackshirts, Greenshirts,
Redshirts, and, in the Middle East, Silvershirts—spread in many countries in the
wake of Fascist and Nazi successes. In spite of their military bearing, uniforms,
and often extensive weaponry, in almost every instance of confrontation between
such militias and the forces of the state, the former were defeated. Thus, when
the Nazis tried to use the embryonic Brownshirts in the 1923 Munich coup
attempt, they were easily overpowered by the police and Hitler was himself
arrested. His subsequent rise to power was achieved by political means, not by
the efforts of the Brownshirts.
In any case, in order to organize and equip a party militia, two scarce
resources are needed: money and the freedom to do so. Recruiting forces from
those maintained by the state requires neither. Therefore, while a whole range of
forces will need to be neutralized, a distinctive approach must be used with the
means of coercion of the state. In dealing with the armed forces, the police, and
the security services, we will have to subvert some forces while neutralizing the
rest; by contrast, in the case of the political forces, the objective will be limited
to their neutralization.
Because of their capacity for direct intervention, the armed forces and the
other means of coercion of the state must be fully neutralized before the actual
coup starts; the political forces usually can be dealt with immediately after the
coup. In some situations, however, the political forces may have an immediate
impact on the course of events and must, therefore, be dealt with prior to the
coup.
In Russia, during the period of instability that followed the first bourgeois
Februaryb 1917 revolution, the railwaymen’s union emerged as a major source
of direct power. Vikzhel (the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Union of
Railroad Employees) played a decisive role in the defeat of General Kornilov’s
putsch by simply refusing to work the railways that were to carry his soldiers to
Petrograd. Later, when Alexander Kerensky, the Russian Provisional
Government’s minister-chairman, fled the city following Lenin’s October coup
and took refuge with Commander Pyoter Krasnov’s army contingent, Vikzhel
threatened to call a general strike (i.e., to leave Krasnov’s troops stranded)
unless Kerensky negotiated peacefully with the Bolsheviks. Since the Bolsheviks
had no intention of negotiating seriously, this amounted to a request for
unconditional surrender.
In the peculiar conditions of Russia in 1917, the railways and those who
controlled them were of crucial importance to the military and to the planners of
any coup—unless their forces were already in Petrograd, still then Russia’s
capital city. Elsewhere, other political forces have the power to exert similar
pressures: in poor countries, where the majority of city dwellers can only buy
food on a day-to-day basis, well-organized shopkeepers can bring great pressure
to bear on the government by refusing to open their shops. Where there is a
strong trade union movement, strikes can impede the vital process of
establishing the authority of the new government immediately after the coup.
Religious and ethnic leaders for their part can use the structures of their
communities to organize mass demonstrations against the new regime.
Therefore, we must identify and evaluate such political forces and, if necessary,
their leading personalities and coordinating bodies must be neutralized before
the coup.c Other political forces lacking such direct power will also have to be
dealt with, but this will be part of the process of conciliation and accommodation
that follows the coup.
Neutralizing the Defenses of the State
One of the outstanding features of modern states is their extensive and
diversified security system. This is a consequence of the general breakdown in
external security and internal stability experienced in many areas of the world in
the last two or three generations. Every state maintains armed forces, a police
force, and some form of intelligence organization at the very least. Many states
find it necessary to have paramilitary gendarmeries in addition to several police
forces, duplicate security services, and other variations on the theme.
In the pre-1914 world, states were not noticeably less aggressive than they are
in present-day international society, but the lack of off-rail transport and a
residual attachment to diplomatic convention resulted in a certain span of time
between hostility and hostilities. The modern pattern of military operations—the
surprise attack and undeclared war—has as a natural consequence the “military”
peace. Instead of small professional armies acting as cadres for wartime
expansion, many states attempt to maintain permanent armies capable of
immediate defense—and therefore offense.
In countries with Muslim populations, local or immigrant, the rise of Islamist
insurgent and terrorist movements has led to an expansion of internal security
forces; paramilitary and undercover police outfits have become common in
many states, including democratic ones.
In the 1930s, the United States had fewer than 300,000 troops in its armed
forces; the only significant intelligence operation was a small (and supremely
efficient) US Navy code-breaking outfit, while internal security forces were
limited to the Treasury’s Secret Service that was mostly active against currency
forgers, though it supplied the presidential bodyguard and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), whose high ambitions were constrained by small budgets.
In 2015, the US Marine Corps alone has some 184,000 men and women in
uniform, while the entire uniformed military establishment has a population of
some 1.4 million even after many large reductions, thereby still outnumbering
  1.
the total population of some seventy UN member states.
Moreover, while the armed forces have greatly diminished in numbers since
the end of the Cold War, notwithstanding all subsequent intervention wars, the
intelligence community has grown enormously into a many-headed bureaucratic
monster, largely because each intelligence failure caused by gross errors induces
Congress to give even more money to those who fail, instead of the opposite.
I am old enough to have heard Secretary of State Dean Acheson deplore the
State Department’s failure to retain the intelligence function within its purview
in the formative years of 1945 to 1947, when the abolition of the wartime stand-
alone Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was followed by the formation of the
very small and improvised Central Intelligence Group with some OSS people as
a temporary expedient. At that point, the State Department could have easily
absorbed that orphan entity, but the career Foreign Service Officers of those
days disliked its ex-OSS “émigré” (read Jewish) intellectuals and assorted tough
guys and, therefore, allowed the rise of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as
an entirely independent agency—which over the years has gained ever greater
funding (regardless of its abysmal performance) and has become a powerful
competitor in the policymaking process.
Worse still, the CIA itself failed to live up to its name from the start because
the army, navy, and the air force retained their own separate intelligence
organizations. The subsequent merging of those organizations beginning in the
mid-1960s did not ensure centralization either because its instrument, the
Defense Intelligence Agency, did not include the code-breakers—a handful of
talents pre-1941, in the thousands by 1945, and later embodied into the immense
National Security Agency (NSA), whose ambition to intercept any and every
electromagnetic transmission, including the idle chatter of infants with cell
phones, was merely dented by the revelations of Edward Snowden, the most
patriotic of traitors. But the hydra has many more heads, 19 of them at the last
count, though there may be more:

—an additional bureaucratic and would-be analytical
echelon established after the 9/11 Intelligence debacle, and
given the impossible task of coordinating the work of the
remaining 18 entities and the even more impossible task of
“fusing” their intelligence into a coherent whole.
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), whose thousands of
employees include very few people who know any foreign
languages other than Spanish perhaps, even fewer people
who know any useful language, and very few undercover
operators (the so-called NOCS, “non-official cover”) as
opposed to general-purpose “analysts,” and an infinity of
managers, very few of whom have any field experience
other than service in foreign “stations,” i.e., offices within
US embassies abroad. The overall result is that CIA
operatives do not emulate their British and Israeli
counterparts by infiltrating terrorist organizations; indeed
they have so little field experience of any kind that most of
the CIA employees killed overseas were the victims of their
own inexperience or those of their managers safely at home.
The frequency of its drastic “reorganizations” (the 2015
version is labeled “from the ground up”) shows that the
CIA’s leaders are aware of its incompetence, but to gain
quality by cutting it down to a small number of truly expert
experts and truly operational operatives goes against the
bureaucratic logic of unceasing growth.

The Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (OICI) of
the US Department of Energy, responsible for all nuclear-
related information, with a major role in monitoring the
nuclear activities of Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan. This
role, however, is impeded by the CIA’s inability to insert its
own agents even in the proximity of installations, let alone
inside them, very understandably in the case of fully closed
North Korea, not so in the other cases.

US Department of Homeland Security, hurriedly established

Coast Guard Intelligence, the office of Homeland Security
Investigations, and so on.

The nominally highest-ranking ODNI was established under the Intelligence
Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 in the futile hope of coordinating
all these separate intelligence organizations and fusing the knowledge scattered
in a huge number of separate brains sitting in separate buildings. The much more
economical alternative of unifying them instead was not even considered
because to cut down and consolidate went against the post-disaster mood of
doing more rather than less. That more is less when it comes to intelligence will
no doubt be recognized one day.
One peculiarity is that the US Congress specifically legislated a strong
suggestion that the director should be an active-duty military officer (“it is
desirable that either the Director or the Prin cipal Deputy Director of National
Intelligence [not both] should be an active-duty commissioned officer in the
armed forces”). That, no doubt, was meant to stop presidents from appointing
their unqualified friends and campaign contributors to the job, regardless of
qualifications, as they do with ambassadors.
Another peculiarity is that the DNI may not serve concurrently as director of
the CIA, a position theoretically greatly diminished by the very existence of the
DNI; so far, however, it is the CIA director who continues to visit the White
House most often—even though the President’s Daily Brief has been produced
by a joint group, and not just the CIA, since February 15, 2014.
In any case, the greatest limitation of the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence is the Defense Department’s continuing control of the three
intelligence organizations that have by far the largest budgets—the NSA, the
NRO, and the NGA—and of all military intelligence activities, except for US
Coast Guard Intelligence, which comes under the US Department of Homeland
Security.

Nothing can remedy the confusions, gaps, and disjunctions caused by the
fragmentation of information flows into so many different organizations,
certainly not the ever-growing new bureaucracy of the Director of National
Intelligence. Indeed, its six “centers” and fifteen “offices” (so far) are further
fragmenting knowledge so that more data equals less intelligence—i.e.,
knowledge both useful and timely.
Contrary to popular legend, and contrary to the 2015 US Senate Intelligence
Committee Torture Report, the CIA has never been an excessively independent,
let alone a rogue entity, and excessive independence is not the problem of any
other US intelligence organization, either. The problem, rather, is their persistent
failu
