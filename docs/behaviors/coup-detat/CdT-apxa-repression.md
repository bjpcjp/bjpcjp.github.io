Appendix A
The Economics of Repression
Once we have carried out our coup and established control over the bureaucracy
and the armed forces, our long-term political survival will depend largely on our
management of the problem of economic development. Economic development
is generally regarded as “a good thing,” and almost everybody wants more of it,
but for us—the newly established government of X-land—the pursuit of
economic development will be undesirable because it militates against our main
goal: political stability.
An economy develops by extending and improving its stock of human and
physical capital, and this requires investment, whether to train people or to build
factories. In order to invest, current income has to be withdrawn from would-be
consumers and channeled away to create capital. Clearly, the higher the rate of
investment, the faster the development of the economy, but also the lower the
present standard of living. The governments of economically backward countries
—where the need for development is manifest—are, therefore, faced with the
alternative of either slow economic development or further reduction of the
already desperately low standard of living. The more that can be taxed from
current incomes, the nearer the beautiful dawn of prosperity—even if it is the
prosperity of Spain rather than that of North America. But there are limits to the
amount of savings that can be forced out of a population whose annual income
per head is already very low: there is an economic survival limit below which
the population—or a large part of it—would simply starve (or retreat into the
pure subsistence economy), but well before this point is reached, there is a
political survival limit below which we, as the government, would be
overthrown. The economic survival limit is more or less rigid: in any particular
environment with a given climate, pattern of nutrition, habits, and traditions,
there will be a minimum annual income that an inhabitant of average
resourcefulness will need to satisfy his and his family’s bodily needs. The
“political survival limit” is, however, very flexible, and it will depend on
psychological, historical, and social factors, as well as on the efficiency of the
system of state security and of the propaganda machine.
The problem was particularly acute in the newly independent states of the
Third World. The colonial regimes may or may not have tried to achieve
economic development, but, if they did try, it was without the urgency that the
new postcolonial regimes tried to achieve. Immediately after independence, then,
instead of the increase in the standard of living that the native population had
been led to expect, the opposite took place. The new “independence”
government had to increase taxes and import duties in order to finance the great
projects with which economic development often starts: roads, hydropower
dams, harbors, and the like. Foreign aid, which many in the “donor” countries
have been led to believe to be very substantial,a only contributes a fraction of the
necessary funds. Except to the extent that foreign investment arrives—and it
does, but only in some countries—most of the money has to come out of current
incomes so that if development efforts are serious, the level of private
consumption actually falls. This impoverishment of those who are already very
poor is not easily tolerated—especially when the mechanism of expectations has
been built up.
Our basic problem, therefore, is to achieve economic development—in order
to satisfy the aspirations of the elite and would-be eliteb—without taxing the
masses beyond the politically safe limit, which could lead to their revolt. There
are two main instruments with which we can persuade the masses to accept the
sacrifice of present consumption for the sake of an increased future income:
propaganda and repressionc or, more efficiently, by a mix ture of both. Imagine,
therefore, that we have inherited a country with a backward economy, a poor but
not particularly poor country, with a gross domestic product per head of
US$2,000 per year, and that US$200 of this was paid out in various taxes while
US$1,800 was spent on current consumption, or saved. Now we know that only
US$500 per inhabitant per year is needed for economic survival, and the
problem is to get ahold of some of the difference in order to finance
development—and to do so without being overthrown. If we simply increase
taxes, the chances are that part of the population will refuse to pay them, and if
administrative methods are used in order to enforce payment, a violent reaction
may ensue. We will, therefore, divert some of the modest tax payments received,
now US$200 from other uses, and spend it on propaganda and the police.
By spending just US$10 per person per year on propaganda and an efficient
police system, we have lowered the political survival limit by US$100, and after
deducting the amount spent on the system of repression and persuasion, we still
have US$90. If we spend another US$10 per person per year, the chances are
that we will be able to “liberate” some more of the possible margin above the
survival limit; however, as we spend more and more money on repression, we
are likely to find that it will lower the safety limit by less and less (see Figure
A.1). And, of course, as we spend more and more on the police and propaganda,
we will find that while the first extra US$100 of taxes costs us US$10 to obtain
with safety, the next US$100 will cost, say, US$20. Eventually, the point is
reached where (as shown in Figure A.1) further ex penditure brings us no
increase in taxation at all. At that point, we spend an extra amount per year and
get no increase at all in the taxes that can safely be collected. Well before that
point is reached, however, there will be an earlier stage when we will spend, say,
an extra US$10 on repression and persuasion and get exactly the same sum in
further taxes. Immediately before that point is the maximum efficiency level of
expenditure on the police and propaganda machine.

Maximum Safety and Zero Economic Development
This is the formula that Haiti’s dictator François “Doc” Duvalier applied in Haiti
with increasing thoroughness from his rise to power in 1957 till his unlamented
death in 1971 (see Figure A.2). Taxation, which was heavy for a country with an
extremely low income per head, was spent almost entirely on the army, the
police, and Duvalier’s very own Tonton Macoute militia, credited with some
30,000 murders, and on propaganda designed to inculcate fear of Duvalier’s
powers, including his voodoo magic. The only major project was useless: the
building of a new capital, “Duvalierville,” which, in any case, was suspended
and then abandoned.
Figure A.2.  The Duvalier formula: political security = maximum economic development = zero.
The Duvalier mix of efficient repression, pervasive propaganda, and no
economic development at all paid off: he lasted in power continuously for
fourteen years, and was then followed by his son Jean Claude “Baby Doc,” who
lasted fifteen more years. The Tonton Macoutes operated as a semipublic
presidential guard and were able to add to their generous salaries by private
exactions from the diminishing business sector. The propaganda machine, which
involves ceremonial parades, laudatory films, and the projection of Papa Doc as
a voodoo master, was almost as expensive to run as the Tonton Macoutes—but
evidently useful. The extreme poverty of the population meant that their level of
political awareness and even physical vitality was extremely low; meanwhile,
the Tonton Macoutes who terrorized everyone else were themselves captive to
Duvalier’s will because, without his voodoo authority, the army and police
would combine to massacre the Tonton Macoutes.
Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, and many other African leaders now dead, in
prison, or in exile, differed radically from Duvalier’s formula by following
policies of high taxation and investment associated with clearly insufficient
propaganda and repression efforts. Nkrumah, in spite of his eccentricities, was
largely defeated by his own success: the by-product of the considerable
economic development achieved by Ghana was to stimulate and educate the
masses and the new elite; their attitude to Nkrumah’s regime became more and
more critical in light of the education the regime itself provided. When this
happens, more and more repression and propaganda are needed to maintain
political stability. In spite of considerable efforts, Nkrumah was unable to build a
sufficiently ruthless police system. The cause of his downfall was not, therefore,
the mismanagement of the economy—which was considerable—but rather the
success of much of the development effort.
The middle way—efficient repression, extensive propaganda, and vigorous
economic development to create new elites that accept or even support the
regime—has long been followed successfully in China. Repression, propaganda,
and economic growth are all interchangeable up to a point, and the most
effective mix to preserve the regime will depend on the particular country and its
political culture.
 
 
 
a Foreign aid has been falling as a percentage of GNP in the developed countries for many years.
b For the elite, economic development subsumes the national goal of modernization with the personal
goal of expanded career opportunities. For the new generation of educated citizens (the would-be elite),
economic development is a guarantee of employment—and the unemployed intelligentsia is a major threat
to many regimes in the Third World.
c By “propaganda,” we mean the whole range of activities whose content is information or entertainment
and whose function, in this case, is (a) to distract attention from present hardship and (b) to justify it in
terms of assured future happiness. This may or may not involve the presentation of the outside world as
even less well off, but it will almost certainly present the past standard of living as much inferior. An
equally important aim of propaganda will be to persuade the masses that the present leadership is the most
efficient vehicle for modernization; this can be done in rational terms by using statistical images, or by
irrational ones that present the leadership as superhuman. By “repression,” we mean the whole range of
political police activities that aim at: (a) suppressing individual political activity by surveillance and
imprisonment, (b) intimidating the masses by displays of force, and (c) preventing the circulation of rival
information by controlling the media and inhibiting public discussion.
