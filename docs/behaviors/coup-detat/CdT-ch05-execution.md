Chapter 5
The Execution of the Coup d’État
As soon as the moral power of national representation was destroyed, a legislative body, whatever it
might be, meant no more to the military than a crowd of five hundred men, less vigorous and
disciplined than a battalion of the same number.
—Madame de Staël, referring to Napoleon’s coup d’état
I came in on a tank, and only a tank will evict me.
—Abu Zuhair Yahya, Iraqi prime minister, 1968
The active phase of a coup is like a military operation—only more so. If the
general principle of tactics is the application of force at the right place, the coup
achieves this with surgical precision by striking at the organizational heart of the
whole state; if speed is very often important in military operations, in the coup it
is an essential requirement. But the coup differs from most military operations in
one crucial respect: while in war it is often advantageous to retain some forces as
reserves to be used in later (and possibly more critical) phases of the fighting, in
a coup the principle of total commitment applies. The active stage takes place in
one short period of time, and forces held back today will be useless tomorrow:
all our forces must be used in our single decisive engagement.
The fact that the coup has practically no time dimension means that we will
not be able to correct significant errors made during its execution; in war, tactics
can be changed, weapons can be replaced, plans reshaped, and soldiers retrained
on the basis of combat experience; in the coup, however, there will not be
sufficient time for any feedback mechanism to work. In this, the coup is similar
to the most modern form of warfare, the strategic missile strike, and the time
factor places the entire burden of decision making in the planning stage. Every
target must be studied in detail before the coup. The team assigned to seize it
must match it in terms of size and composition; its every move must be planned
in advance, and no tactical flexibility can be allowed.
With this degree of detailed planning, there will be no need for any sort of
headquarters structure in the active stage of the coup; if there is no scope for
decision making, there is no need for decision makers and their apparatus. In
fact, having a headquarters would be a serious disadvantage: it would constitute
a concrete target for the opposition—one that would be both vulnerable and
easily identified. As soon as the coup starts, the ruling group will know that
something is happening, but unless coups are very frequent in the country, they
will not know what that something is; it could be a mutiny, an insurrection, the
opening of a guerrilla war, or even the beginning of an invasion by a foreign
power. All these forms of conflict represent threats to the regime, but they are all
different in terms of their immediate significance and—more important—in
terms of the measures required to meet them. We should avoid taking any action
that will clarify the nature of the threat and thus reduce the confusion that is left
in the defensive apparatus of the regime. Our teams will emerge from their bases
and proceed to seize their designated targets while operating as independent
units; their collective purpose and their coordination will remain unknown until
it is too late for any effective opposition. The leaders of the coup will be
scattered among the various teams, each joining the team whose ultimate target
requires his presence; thus, the spokesmen for the coup will be with the teams
that will seize the radio/television stations, and the prospective chief of police
will be with the team whose target is the police headquarters. As each team will
be both small and highly mobile, and as there will be no functioning
headquarters throughout the active phase of the coup, the opposition will not
have any single target on which to concentrate its forces. In this way, their
numerical superiority will be dissipated, and the smaller forces of the coup will
have local superiority in the area of each particular target. This will be the key to
the victory of the coup.
On the Eve
In Chapters 2 and 3 of this book, we surveyed the planning of the coup in terms
of the neutralization of the “professional” defenses of the state and the selection
of those targets that would assist the neutralization of the “political” forces. We
analyzed the structure of the armed forces and of other means of coercion, and
we saw that much of the armed forces, a significant part of the police system,
and some of the security services could not intervene—either for or against us—
in the event of a coup. This was due to their remote location, dispersed
deployment, or because their training and equipment were inadequate,
unsuitable, or overspecialized. Then, we infiltrated the relatively small part of
the apparatus that did have an intervention capability, so that much of it was
technically neutralized and some of it totally subverted. This will ensure for us
the neutrality of much of the defenses of the state and the active cooperation of
some of its parts. The infiltration of the army and police has given us an
instrument: the units that we have incorporated and that form the forces of the
coup. Additionally, we have prepared for the utilization of this instrument by
selecting the targets on which it will be used: we have identified the physical
targets that must be seized and those that will have to be sabotaged or otherwise
interdicted, and we have selected the leading personalities among the potential
opposition, both in and out of the government, and prepared for their arrest.
But one major task has not been covered in the planning stage: the forcible
isolation of the “hard-core” loyalist forces. Hopefully, the strength of those
forces we have been unable to infiltrate (assuming they have an intervention
capability) will not be very great. But even if they are weak in absolute terms,
we dare not ignore them. To do so would be to invalidate all the measures we
have taken to insulate the capital city—and ourselves—from the intervention of
hostile forces. The extreme instability of the balance of forces during the active
phase of the coup means that what in other circumstances would only be a minor
threat could then have disastrous consequences. If the “hard-core” loyalist forces
are large in relation to our own, we will indeed have to divert a considerable
amount of our forces to their isolation.
Though we have been unable to penetrate these “hard-core” loyalist forces,
two things will probably have been achieved: (1) their number, quality, and
location will be known to us, and (2) our general measures of neutralization will
have reduced their overall effectiveness. Their fighting capability will not have
been eroded, but, as Table 5.1 illustrates, their intervention against us will be
delayed and disrupted.
Table 5.1.  The mechanics of intervention of the loyalist forces
Phase
Effect of our general measures
1. Police/security agency personnel raise initial alarm and seek to contact
their HQ.
Telephone exchanges have been seized, and cell
phone relays are switched off. They must,
therefore, send a verbal message.
2. Police/security agency HQ verify the reports and realize the seriousness
of the threat. HQ tries to communicate with political leadership.
As above for communications. Some
messengers fail to arrive as focal traffic
points are gradually occupied.
3. Political leadership calls for army and police intervention.
As above for communications. Some units
missing from their barracks; others refuse to
move; others cannot move because of
technical neutralization.
4. Political leaders begin to realize the extent of our infiltration of the
armed forces and police. Loyalist troops respond.
As above for communications. Only military
radio links can be used to communicate with
loyalist forces.
5. Uninfiltrated forces assemble and prepare for intervention. They try to
reach political leadership for a confirmation of their orders. Some
defect to us, others choose neutrality, but some remain under the control
of the government.
Many political leaders no longer available;
some have been arrested and some are in
hiding.
6. Loyalist forces move on to the capital city or, if already within the area,
move in to the city center.
Airports closed and landing strips interdicted.
Railways interrupted and trains stopped. City
entry points controlled by our roadblocks.
Loyalist forces in capital city area are then isolated by direct means.
Our purpose is not to destroy the loyalist forces militarily (we can deal with
their cadres administratively, after the coup) but merely to immobilize them for a
few crucial hours. The tactics that will be used must be exclusively defensive: a
ring of blocking positions around each concentration of loyalist forces or, if this
is not possible, a similar ring around the capital city. Thus, though we will be on
the strategic offensive (in the sense that we are the ones who want to change the
situation in general), we will also be on the tactical defensive, and this will give
us important technical and psychological advantages. By using defended
roadblocks to isolate the loyalist forces, we will put the onus of initiating any
fighting on them: our forces will be content to wait, and it will be the loyalist
forces that will try to pass through. Should a column of loyalist forces arrive at
the roadblock, their leaders will be faced by opposite numbers wearing the same
uniform and belonging to the same armed force, perhaps even to the same
regiment. Both sides will state that they are “obeying orders,” but interestingly
enough, the “orders” of the leaders of our forces will probably appear more
legitimate than those of the leaders of the loyalist troops. Owing to our arrests
and our interdiction of the physical facilities, the “legitimate” orders will
probably have taken an unusual form: the source of the orders to the loyalist
troops will probably be somebody other than the appropriate superior in the
hierarchy; the method used to convey them will probably be an unusual
emergency one; and the actual orders will likely be indistinguishable in form
from ones that might have been issued by the planners of a coup.
Thus, the officers of the loyalist forces may have received orders stating,
“Move into the city center, hold the Parliament building and the radio station.”
The leadership may have added that they would be acting against the forces of a
coup, but, even so, such orders would have “insurrectional” undertones. When
army officers find themselves doing unusual things, their natural reaction is to
try and fit them into familiar patterns; the most familiar pattern of all will be to
arrive at the conclusion that the “politicians are guilty of yet another ‘mess.’ ”
The most probable course of action will be to request clarification from their
superior officers. It is to be hoped that these officers will have decided to remain
neutral or else have been arrested; in either case, the “clarification” will never
arrive.
If, on the other hand, the loyalist units decide to force the roadblock, we will
benefit from the tactical advantages of the defensive. These include the
opportunity of choosing the place (natural obstructions such as bridges and
tunnels) and the opportunity of deploying and camouflaging weapons and men.
In order to make the fullest use of both the psychological and the tactical
advantages, the blocking position should have a dual structure: a (largely
symbolic) first line composed of some suitable physical obstacle, such as cross-
parked heavy vehicles, with a few men bearing “orders” to forbid all passage;
beyond this, there will be a second (military) line, much stronger numerically,
with weapons and men deployed to repel an eventual assault (the operational
detail involved is discussed in Appendix B). The idea is not to ambush the
loyalists to inflict maximum damage—on the contrary, the defenders of the
blocking position should inform the incoming loyalist forces that there is such a
second line of defense in order to deter them. Because the strength of a
camouflaged force is hard to assess, it can serve as a deterrent even if it is
numerically weak as compared to the opposition.
The situation at each blocking position will require delicate handling, and it
will be necessary that the soldiers on our side understand that their primary
function is to avoid combat rather than to engage in it successfully. In concrete
terms, their mission will be a delaying operation rather than a decisive one, and
this will have precise implications in terms of the weapons and tactics to be
employed.
Timing, Sequence, and Security
Ideally, the timing of the coup will be completely flexible so that we can take
advantage of any favorable circumstances that may arise—the temporary
absence of the leadership from the capital city, for instance, or the outbreak of
some coincidental civil disorders (see Figure 5.1). This flexibility, which would
be highly desirable, is only rarely possible, however, because the infiltration of
the army and police will be a dynamically unstable process: the circle of those
who have decided to join us will grow and continue growing as a bandwagon
effect is generated; but unless the coup materializes, there will eventually be a
movement into neutrality or even opposition. Meanwhile, the danger of
denunciation will also increase as more and more people become aware that a
coup is being planned, or, at any rate, that “something is up.” The timing of the
coup will therefore be dictated by the progress of our infiltration of the armed
forces and police; as soon as a satisfactory degree of penetration is achieved, the
coup must be executed. This implies that it will not be possible to designate a
date well in advance of the coup that can be communicated to the various teams.
This is just as well because it means that the date cannot be leaked to the security
agencies. Actually, it is quite likely that some information about us will have
reached the security agencies, but this should not affect the outcome. As the
preparations for the coup proceed, more and more truthful information about our
actions (“signals”) will be in circulation, but it will also be increasingly obscured
by “noise.”a
Figure 5.1.  Operational sequence and timing.
Every move we make will generate information that could eventually reach
the security agencies, but the consequences and misinterpretations of our actions
will generate an equal or greater amount of “noise.” This will make it
increasingly difficult for the analysts of the security agencies to identify the
nature of the threat because their capacity for processing information is not
unlimited. This process is illustrated by Figure 5.2, in which O–Z is the normal
level of “noise” received at all times, O–A is the processing capacity of the
analysts at the security agencies, and X is the point beyond which the total flow
of data exceeds processing capacity so that each item of real data is accorded a
diminishing amount of attention.b
Figure 5.2.  Intelligence “noise” and analysis; area of surveillance of security agencies penetrated.
Even if the security agencies could isolate the real data from the “noise,” they
will not usually take immediate action. Their pro fessional instinct will be to try
to uncover all the ramifications of the plot so as to be able to arrest all its
participants. And it may be hoped that the coup will be executed while the
security agencies are still engaged in their investigations. But their people will
be aware of this timing problem and, therefore, are quite likely to respond to a
possible threat by going ahead to arrest those of the planners of the coup that
they have identified. This nervousness presents a special problem on the eve of
the coup: our final preparations will probably generate a sharp increase in the
total flow of “signals” received by the security agencies. Even without
separating them from “noise,” the mere increase in the total flow of information
could be interpreted as a danger signal (as it certainly would be by competent
analysts) and this might trigger the arrests.
In practice, it will rarely be possible to achieve total security within all the
forces of the coup, and we should assume as a working hypothesis that they
have, in fact, been infiltrated by the security agency. This leads to the general
defensive procedures discussed in Chapter 3, but it will also have precise
operational implications:
(a) Each team will be told well in advance what equipment and tactics
will be required to seize its particular target, but not the exact
designation of the target.
(b) Each team will only be told its designated target when it actually
receives the signal to proceed to its seizure.
(c) Each team will be alerted individually, with only as much advance
warning as it requires to prepare for its particular task, instead of a
general go-signal for all teams.
Figure 5.3.  Lead time required by teams to reach their targets by zero hour.
Because the teams will have different starting points and different targets to
go to, the use of any one general signal would either give insufficient warning to
some teams or an unnecessarily long one to others. The longer the time between
the announcement that the coup is “on” and its actual execution, the greater the
likelihood that information will reach the security agencies in time to prevent the
successful execution of the coup because this will be the moment at which their
operatives in our ranks could send out warnings.
The problem of warning time and lead time is illustrated in Figure 5.3. If we
give all our teams a ten-hour warning period by sending out a general call at
hour –10, then team No. 1 will just about reach its target in time, but all the other
teams will have received “excess warning”; in other words, information will
have been distributed before it was essential to do so. If we give all the teams a
two-hour warning period, then “excess warning” will be zero but team No. 5 will
reach its target several hours before team No. 1 and those defending it will
probably be on a full alert. The solution appears to be a simple one: make
warning time equal to lead time so that each team is alerted just in time to allow
it to reach its target by the zero hour.
In reality, the problem is more complex. It is not a matter of simultaneous
arrival at the target but rather of the simultaneous penetration of the early
warning system maintained by the security agencies of the state. If, for example,
team No. 2 has to cross the entire capital city to reach its target, the security
agency will probably be alerted as soon as it enters the city at, say, hour –2.
Thus, by the time team No. 4 reached its target, the opposition would have had
two hours to prepare for its defense. We may have very little information on the
functioning of the security apparatus, but we can operate on the assumption that
a team (if it is large and/or equipped with armor) will be noticed and reported as
soon as it enters the capital city. We must therefore ensure: (a) the protection of
our security position against an internal threat, which is achieved by minimizing
“excess warning time,” and (b) the protection of our security position against
external observation, which is achieved by simultaneous penetration of the
capital city area.
Both aims will be achieved by sending the teams into action at a time
corresponding to their “lead times” to the capital city boundary (or other
applicable perimeter). This is illustrated in Figure 5.4.c
Figure 5.4.  Simultaneous penetration of the defensive warning system and team warning time.
Into Action
The actual execution of the coup will require many different qualities: skillful
off-the-cuff diplomacy at a blocking position confronted by loyalist forces;
instant personnel management at radio and television stations to persuade their
technic
