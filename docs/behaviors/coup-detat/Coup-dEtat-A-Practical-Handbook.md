I enlisted Sawyer Blazek, a scholarly practitioner with then recent African
experience and now an adviser on national security affairs, to help me update the
book. It was a fortunate decision because it was with talented acuity that he
separated the old but instructive from the outdated that needed replacement.
Thanks to his work, my revision was greatly facilitated. I am happy to
acknowledge his valiant assistance.
Preface to the 2016 Edition
When writing what became the first edition of this book almost half a century
ago, I scarcely imagined that it would have an entire existence of its own,
remaining in print till today through seven editions in English and nineteen
editions in foreign languages from Arabic to Russian, although the Chinese
edition has been published, very elegantly, only in Taiwan.
•  •  •
A few things have changed since I wrote the original text. Coup plotters, for
example, cannot expect to gain much these days by seizing “the radio station,”
first, because instead of a single national radio broadcaster there might now be a
dozen, even in very small countries; but more, because broadcasting of any kind
counts for less and less in a world of narrowcasting via social media.
This and other technical changes are duly accounted for in this revised text,
but all through the years to the last coup recorded in 2015, the essence of the
coup d’état has remained exactly the same: it is a special form of politics that
requires guns as an aid to persuasion, although coups rarely succeed if guns are
much used and fail totally if the situation degenerates into civil war—the polar
opposite of the swift and bloodless coup d’état.
In reviewing the text to determine what changes might be needed for the 2016
edition, I found many small details in need of updating but also a major
omission: corruption as the trigger of many a coup d’état.
It is all a matter of incentives. In the absence of significant corruption, the
coup plotters who risk their necks to overthrow their seniors and seize control of
the government can gain only an increase in status, but not vast wealth. The
difference in salaries and pensions between colonels and presidents is downright
negligible as compared to the risks.
With corruption, however, those who seize power can enrich themselves
enormously, sometimes by simply taking what they want from the country’s
national bank with its foreign-exchange reserves, or, more discreetly, by taking
their cut on all state purchases, by exacting bribes from all who need anything
from the government, by securing loans from state banks that are never repaid,
or by setting up family members as business agents—indeed there are myriad
ways of converting state power into self-enrichment. The corrupt rulers of even
the smallest and poorest countries can swiftly become billionaires. Corruption,
therefore, actually generates coups because if successful their material rewards
can be so very large.
One major change since the original text was published in 1968 has been the
widespread implementation of specific anti-coup precautions and provisions. To
some degree, they may have been stimulated by the original book itself—or so I
have been told by the security officials of more than one country: while coup
plot ters have tried to benefit from its contents (more on this notion later),
potentates and their minders have seemingly done the same in designing their
anti-coup measures.
By far the most important is to maintain distinct, indeed entirely separate
military, paramilitary, and other security organizations so that none has a
monopoly of force. Typically, there is a “national,” “presidential,” or
“revolutionary” guard equipped heavily enough to resist the regular army, and
also a militia of fellow ethnics in some cases. In addition, there is always some
inner-core palace security force of several hundred at least, but sometimes of
thousands, exceptionally well trained or at least very well equipped by local
standards, and which must of course be commanded by a son or nephew of the
ruler, with as many relatives, or at least fellow clan members, as possible in their
cadre of officers, and even the other ranks enlisted from the clan or at least the
ethnic group of the rulers. Sometimes openly labeled as a Presidential or Royal
or Revolutionary guard division, brigade, or regiment, such inner-core forces
may also bear deliberately nondescript designations, even though everybody
knows that, say, the 12th Division or 27th Brigade or 355th Battalion is really
the “it” force—the one with all the latest equipment, above-average facilities,
higher pay, and the ruler’s relatives in command.
Even safely democratic countries keep a variety of distinct military and
security forces wearing different uniforms despite their overlapping functions.
The difference, however, is that their distinct forces are constantly enjoined to
communicate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other, and usually come
under “joint” commands staffed by all of them to better unify their actions.
When diversity has an anti-coup function, however, there is no joint
operational headquarters, and far from being enjoined to cooperate, any
communication among the different forces is discouraged, or even prohibited:
social gatherings seemingly as innocent as a birthday party may well evoke acute
suspicion, followed perhaps by interrogations if officers of, say, army, national
guard, and gendarmerie are all present. This politically imposed absence of
intercommunication and coordination is a major cause, incidentally, for the Arab
military debacles that foreign observers routinely attribute to gross professional
incompetence alone. The case of South Korea is also illustrative: It was precisely
for the sake of better coordination in responding to the threat of North Korean
commando attacks that the United States pressed the South Koreans to merge
their Army Security Command, Navy Security Unit, and Air Force Office of
Special Investigations into a single organization. A fully integrated, authentically
joint Defense Security Command was ceremoniously inaugurated in October
1977. Two years later, its two-star commanding general, Chun Doo Hwan, used
his fully unified command and monopoly of immediate force to seize power
when the country’s president, Park Chung Hee, was assassinated. There was no
one to restrain him when Chun investigated, judged, and condemned the
country’s top general, the army’s chief of staff, and then jumped over all the
three-star and four-star officers above him to make himself the country’s
president. It could not have happened if there had still been three competing
security organizations instead of a monopoly.
•  •  •
Another anti-coup provision routinely employed in vulnerable countries is
espionage of a particular kind, focused not outwardly on foreign countries but
inwardly on the country’s own armed and security forces—all of them, from the
regular air force, army, even navy, to the national guard, revolutionary guard,
and the inner-core security force of the regime as well. Because inner-core
forces are literally closest to the ruler, they are also potentially the most
dangerous. Inward espionage is the most valuable of anti-coup measures because
there can be no sudden, overnight coup without prior agreements among the
plotters; those agreements in turn require prior talks leading to detailed
negotiations on who does what in the coup and who gets what the day after,
when, power having been seized, its rewards by way of promotions and positions
are divided up. All this implies a great deal of pre-coup communications that can
be overheard—or even heard face-to-face—if agents of the regime insert
themselves among the coup plotters. Such agents can even initiate the plotting to
identify potentially dangerous individuals who are best eliminated before they
have a chance to plot a real coup of their own.
The problem with espionage, however, is that those who spy on the coup
plotters are in the best position to join them, with all the incentives of power and
riches if the coup is successful.
The remedy, of course, is to have multiple, entirely separate, inward
espionage outfits to answer the ancient question of who will guard the guardians.
Once known, this multiplicity deters regime spies from joining the coup plotters
because of the possibility that the plotters include other regime spies who can
expose them. Thus, in Syria, even before the civil war now under way, the ruling
regime of President Bashar al-Assad already had five separate and competing
espionage services: (a) the so-called Air Force Intelligence Directorate, which
hardly bothers with enemy air forces but focuses instead on internal security
against rebels and possible coup plotters (note that the last successful coup in
Syria was executed precisely by an air force chief, Hafez al-Assad, father of the
current president; (b) the General Security Directorate, which investigates,
arrests, interrogates, and tortures suspected enemies of the regime, civil or
military; (c) the Military Intelligence Directorate, which occasionally does or did
some actual military intelligence work but now focuses exclusively on fellow
Syrians who oppose the regime verbally or violently; (d) the National Security
Bureau of the Arab Socialist Ba‘ath Party, which is officially the ruling party but
which ceased to be a functioning political body long ago and is now merely a
brand of the Assad family and clan; and (e) the Political Security Directorate,
which originally focused on members of the nominally ruling Ba‘ath Party
before spying on all potential enemies of the regime—resulting in a heavy
workload as of late 2015, given that roughly 75 percent of the population is
actively fighting or at least passively resisting the Assad regime.
What all these organizations have in common is that their key positions are
mostly held by Alawites (or more accurately, Nusayris, prior to a 1920s
rebranding), followers of a nominally Shi‘a religion, along with some Christians
and Druzes (the latter being another heretical sect), but with very few Sunni
Muslims, the country’s majority population. Not coincidentally, the Assads are
also Alawites more accurately. Moreover, as of 2015, with civil war under way,
the General Security Directorate and its four competitors are no longer alone in
spying on fellow Syrians in the armed forces, the government, or the population
at large; new security forces have been raised, manned primarily by Alawites,
and some have now formed their own espionage units.
But even this abundant multiplicity would not have impressed Yasser Arafat.
While ruling the Palestinian ministate established in 1994 under the Oslo
Accords, he established some twelve sepa rate espionage organizations, which
focused on his fellow Palestinians rather than on Israeli or other Arab targets;
they served him particularly well in 1997, when the Palestinian Liberation
Council, the parliament in effect, accused Arafat of “financial mismanagement”
(his widow lives very elegantly in Paris till now) and Arafat refused to resign his
post. Council members were swiftly intimidated into silence.
Multiplicity works as an anti-coup measure, and it works best when there are
competing armed forces, as well as rival internal espionage outfits. But such
arrangements, of course, greatly increase the costs of operating the regime,
reducing its ability to give out benefits to gain popularity and making it that
much more likely that unrest will smolder, leading to violent repression,
resistance, and even civil war. That is what happened in Syria once the frozen
immobility of prolonged dictatorship was shaken in 2011 by news of earlier
uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Over the nearly five decades since the original publication of this book, I
have been told from time to time that it served as the guide for this or that coup
(in the Philippines, its use has been documented in two successive coups). But
the earliest case of actual use for which there is firm evidence would make a
poor advertisement: the coup in question was a total failure. Its chief protagonist,
Mohammad Oufkir, was Morocco’s minister of defense and security
plenipotentiary, the kingdom’s most powerful person after King Hassan II—an
exception he seemingly found irksome. On August 16, 1972, four F-5 jet fighters
of the Royal Air Force, reportedly acting on Oufkir’s orders, intercepted
Hassan’s Boeing 727 jet as it was flying back from France, firing their powerful
20mm guns at short range. Their aim was remarkably poor, and Hassan’s aircraft
managed to land safely at Rabat’s airport. It was then strafed by air force jets,
with the cannon killing eight and injuring forty, but not Hassan; loyal troops
came to protect him, while others soon proceeded to the Kenitra Air Base of the
rebellious air force officers, where hundreds were arrested. Oufkir was found
dead of multiple gunshot wounds later that day. When his study was searched, a
heavily annotated and blood-splattered copy of the French edition of this book
was found on his desk. I could take refuge in the excuse that the book’s
prescriptions were not followed with sufficient care, but in reality it was not my
purpose to supply a bona fide do-it-yourself manual. My true aim in writing this
book was entirely different: it was to explore the meaning of politics in the many
backward countries politely described as “emerging.” Some, including South
Korea, have well and truly emerged since then, but many others have not—Islam
in particular seems to be an insurmountable obstacle to democratic governance.
When the ideas in this book were first conceived, the intellectual classes of
the Western world were passionately interested in the affairs of what they then
called the Third World. There was an atmosphere of hopeful expectation about
the new states of Africa and Asia emerging on the world scene for the first time.
Even for Latin America, there was a new interest and a new sense of hope—
greatly stimulated by President John F. Kennedy’s “Alliance for Progress,”
which, like all of Kennedy’s projects, enjoyed excellent publicity. But it was
undoubtedly sub-Saharan or Black Africa that stimulated the greatest interest,
much of it remarkably emotional. The dissolution of the British and French
empires was then still in progress, and the new states of Africa were the newest
of all. Their abject poverty was not entirely concealed by the exotic scenery; the
almost complete absence of an educated class was brutally obvious. Yet, it was
only a few right-wing extremists, and the still smaller number of old African
hands, who argued that independence was being granted too soon. This small
minority was easily dismissed as reactionary and racist. The enlightened knew
better: the new states would muster the fresh energies of the peoples liberated
from the lethargy of colonial rule; their youth would soon be educated to provide
technicians, professionals, and civil servants; given some aid from the West, a
great upsurge of economic development was to be expected, and this would soon
remedy backwardness and the contrived poverty caused by colonial exploitation.
More than that, we were told to look for moral leadership from the new states.
The idealistic young leaders who had struggled for independence would be a
great spiritual force on the world scene.
As a student at the London School of Economics, I heard such things being
said as if they were not merely true but obvious. I had no desire to join the small
band of right wingers who alone opposed the accelerated devolution of the
British Empire. But I found the common view to be hopelessly removed from
reality; even the best minds seemed to suffer a decomposition of the critical
faculties when the subject was the Third World. This is not the place to speculate
on the obscure emotional reasons that alone could explain such a failure of the
intellect. What is certain is that a highly favorable vision of the future of the
Third World was given wide currency, even though all the factual evidence in
hand flatly contradicted all such predictions.
It was not the poverty of the new states that made me dubious of their future
and entirely pessimistic about their contribution to international life. Poverty
does not necessarily inhibit cultural or even social achievement, and, in any case,
some of the least promising of the new states we
