Have something you want to change?  Want to change someone’s mind or how an organization works?  It’s not about pushing harder, or being more 
persuasive, it’s about removing the barriers to change. REDUCE these five key roadblocks and you can change anything.
When pushed, people 
push back. So rather 
than telling people 
what to do, or trying 
to persuade, catalysts 
allow for agency and 
encourage people to 
convince themselves. 
How can we allow 
for agency (Truth 
campaign), provide a 
menu (Nafeez Amin), 
or highlight a gap 
(Smoking Kid)?
People are wedded to 
what they’re already 
doing. The status quo. 
To ease endowment, 
we need to surface the 
costs of inaction (Gloria 
Barrett), burn the ships 
(Cortes), and frame new 
things as regaining a loss 
(Brexit).
Perspectives that are 
too far away fall in 
the region of rejection 
and get discounted. 
So start by asking for 
less (Silvia Branscom). 
Find an unsticking 
point and use it to 
switch the field (Deep 
Canvassing).
Change almost always 
involves uncertainty, 
and this ambiguity 
makes people hit 
the pause button, 
stemming action.  To 
get people to un-pause, 
increase trialability. 
Harness freemium 
(Dropbox), reduce 
upfront costs (Zappos), 
and drive discovery 
(Acura Experience).
Sometimes one person, isn’t enough.  
Some things need more proof. So find 
reinforcement. Use multiple sources (Mike 
Loverde), concentrate them close in time, 
and figure out whether you need a firehose 
or a sprinkler.
