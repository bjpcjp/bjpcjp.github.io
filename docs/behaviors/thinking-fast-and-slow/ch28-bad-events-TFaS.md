Bad Events
The concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of
psychology to behavioral economics. This is odd, because the idea that
people evaluate many outcomes as gains and losses, and that losses
loom larger than gains, surprises no one. Amos and I often joked that we
were engaged in studying a subject about which our grandmothers knew a
great deal. In fact, however, we know more than our grandmothers did and
can now embed loss aversion in the context of a broader two-systems
model of the mind, and specifically a biological and psychological view in
which negativity and escape dominate positivity and approach. We can
also trace the consequences of loss aversion in surprisingly diverse
observations: only out-of-pocket losses are compensated when goods are
lost in transport; attempts at large-scale reforms very often fail; and
professional golfers putt more accurately for par than for a birdie. Clever
as she was, my grandmother would have been surprised by the specific
predictions from a general idea she considered obvious.
Negativity Dominance
Figure 12
Your heartbeat accelerated when you looked at the left-hand figure. It
accelerated even before you could label what is so eerie about that
picture. After some time you may have recognized the eyes of a terrified
person. The eyes on the right, narrowed by the Crro raised cheeks of a
smile, express happiness—and they are not nearly as exciting. The two
pictures were presented to people lying in a brain scanner. Each picture
was shown for less than 2/100 of a second and immediately masked by
“visual noise,” a random display of dark and bright squares. None of the
observers ever consciously knew that he had seen pictures of eyes, but
one part of their brain evidently knew: the amygdala, which has a primary
role as the “threat center” of the brain, although it is also activated in other
emotional states. Images of the brain showed an intense response of the
amygdala to a threatening picture that the viewer did not recognize. The
information about the threat probably traveled via a superfast neural
channel that feeds directly into a part of the brain that processes emotions,
bypassing the visual cortex that supports the conscious experience of
“seeing.” The same circuit also causes schematic angry faces (a potential
threat) to be processed faster and more efficiently than schematic happy
faces. Some experimenters have reported that an angry face “pops out” of
a crowd of happy faces, but a single happy face does not stand out in an
angry crowd. The brains of humans and other animals contain a
mechanism that is designed to give priority to bad news. By shaving a few
hundredths of a second from the time needed to detect a predator, this
circuit improves the animal’s odds of living long enough to reproduce. The
automatic operations of System 1 reflect this evolutionary history. No
comparably rapid mechanism for recognizing good news has been
detected. Of course, we and our animal cousins are quickly alerted to
signs of opportunities to mate or to feed, and advertisers design billboards
accordingly. Still, threats are privileged above opportunities, as they should
be.
The brain responds quickly even to purely symbolic threats. Emotionally
loaded words quickly attract attention, and bad words (war, crime) attract
attention faster than do happy words (peace, love). There is no real threat,
but the mere reminder of a bad event is treated in System 1 as
threatening. As we saw earlier with the word vomit, the symbolic
representation associatively evokes in attenuated form many of the
reactions to the real thing, including physiological indices of emotion and
even fractional tendencies to avoid or approach, recoil or lean forward.
The sensitivity to threats extends to the processing of statements of
opinions with which we strongly disagree. For example, depending on your
attitude to euthanasia, it would take your brain less than one-quarter of a
second to register the “threat” in a sentence that starts with “I think
euthanasia is an acceptable/unacceptable…”
The psychologist Paul Rozin, an expert on disgust, observed that a
single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries,
but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches. As he points
out, the negative trumps the positive in many ways, and loss aversion is
one of many manifestations of a broad negativity dominance. Other
scholars, in a paper titled “Bad Is Stronger Than Good,” summarized the
evidence as follows: “Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have
more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more
thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-
definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad
stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than
good ones.” They cite John Gottman, the well-known expert in marital
relations, who observed that the long-term success of a relationship
depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive.
Gottman estimated that a stable relationship requires Brro Qres Brrthat
good interactions outnumber bad interactions by at least 5 to 1. Other
asymmetries in the social domain are even more striking. We all know that
a friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single
action.
Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into our
biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as bad and to
sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations, however, the boundary
between good and bad is a reference point that changes over time and
depends on the immediate circumstances. Imagine that you are out in the
country on a cold night, inadequately dressed for the torrential rain, your
clothes soaked. A stinging cold wind completes your misery. As you
wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter from the
fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac would call the
experience of that moment intensely pleasurable because it functions, as
pleasure normally does, to indicate the direction of a biologically
significant improvement of circumstances. The pleasant relief will not last
very long, of course, and you will soon be shivering behind the rock again,
driven by your renewed suffering to seek better shelter.
Goals are Reference Points
Loss aversion refers to the relative strength of two motives: we are driven
more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains. A reference point is
sometimes the status quo, but it can also be a goal in the future: not
achieving a goal is a loss, exceeding the goal is a gain. As we might
expect from negativity dominance, the two motives are not equally
powerful. The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much
stronger than the desire to exceed it.
People often adopt short-term goals that they strive to achieve but not
necessarily to exceed. They are likely to reduce their efforts when they
have reached an immediate goal, with results that sometimes violate
economic logic. New York cabdrivers, for example, may have a target
income for the month or the year, but the goal that controls their effort is
typically a daily target of earnings. Of course, the daily goal is much easier
to achieve (and exceed) on some days than on others. On rainy days, a
New York cab never remains free for long, and the driver quickly achieves
his target; not so in pleasant weather, when cabs often waste time cruising
the streets looking for fares. Economic logic implies that cabdrivers should
work many hours on rainy days and treat themselves to some leisure on
mild days, when they can “buy” leisure at a lower price. The logic of loss
aversion suggests the opposite: drivers who have a fixed daily target will
work many more hours when the pickings are slim and go home early
when rain-drenched customers are begging to be taken somewhere.
The economists Devin Pope and Maurice Schweitzer, at the University
of Pennsylvania, reasoned that golf provides a perfect example of a
reference point: par. Every hole on the golf course has a number of strokes
associated with it; the par number provides the baseline for good—but not
outstanding—performance. For a professional golfer, a birdie (one stroke
under par) is a gain, and a bogey (one stroke over par) is a loss. The
economists compared two situations a player might face when near the
hole:
 
putt to avoid a bogey
putt to achieve a birdie
Every stroke counts in golf, and in professional golf every stroke counts a
lot. According to prospect theory, however, some strokes count more than
others. Failing to make par is a los Brro Q los Brrs, but missing a birdie
putt is a foregone gain, not a loss. Pope and Schweitzer reasoned from
loss aversion that players would try a little harder when putting for par (to
avoid a bogey) than when putting for a birdie. They analyzed more than 2.5
million putts in exquisite detail to test that prediction.
They were right. Whether the putt was easy or hard, at every distance
from the hole, the players were more successful when putting for par than
for a birdie. The difference in their rate of success when going for par (to
avoid a bogey) or for a birdie was 3.6%. This difference is not trivial. Tiger
Woods was one of the “participants” in their study. If in his best years Tiger
Woods had managed to putt as well for birdies as he did for par, his
average tournament score would have improved by one stroke and his
earnings by almost $1 million per season. These fierce competitors
certainly do not make a conscious decision to slack off on birdie putts, but
their intense aversion to a bogey apparently contributes to extra
concentration on the task at hand.
The study of putts illustrates the power of a theoretical concept as an aid
to thinking. Who would have thought it worthwhile to spend months
analyzing putts for par and birdie? The idea of loss aversion, which
surprises no one except perhaps some economists, generated a precise
and nonintuitive hypothesis and led researchers to a finding that surprised
everyone—including professional golfers.
Defending the Status Quo
If you are set to look for it, the asymmetric intensity of the motives to avoid
losses and to achieve gains shows up almost everywhere. It is an ever-
present feature of negotiations, especially of renegotiations of an existing
contract, the typical situation in labor negotiations and in international
discussions of trade or arms limitations. The existing terms define
reference points, and a proposed change in any aspect of the agreement
is inevitably viewed as a concession that one side makes to the other.
Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to
reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your
losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.
Inevitably, you will place a higher value on them than I do. The same is true,
of course, of the very painful concessions you demand from me, which you
do not appear to value sufficiently! Negotiations over a shrinking pie are
especially difficult, because they require an allocation of losses. People
tend to be much more easygoing when they bargain over an expanding
pie.
Many of the messages that negotiators exchange in the course of
bargaining are attempts to communicate a reference point and provide an
anchor to the other side. The messages are not always sincere.
Negotiators often pretend intense attachment to some good (perhaps
missiles of a particular type in bargaining over arms reductions), although
they actually view that good as a bargaining chip and intend ultimately to
give it away in an exchange. Because negotiators are influenced by a
norm of reciprocity, a concession that is presented as painful calls for an
equally painful (and perhaps equally inauthentic) concession from the other
side.
Animals, including people, fight harder to prevent losses than to achieve
gains. In the world of territorial animals, this principle explains the success
of defenders. A biologist observed that “when a territory holder is
challenged by a rival, the owner almost always wins the contest—usually
within a matter of seconds.” In human affairs, the same simple rule explains
much of what happens when institutions attempt to reform themselves, in
“reo Brro Q;reo Brrrganizations” and “restructuring” of companies, and in
efforts to rationalize a bureaucracy, simplify the tax code, or reduce
medical costs. As initially conceived, plans for reform almost always
produce many winners and some losers while achieving an overall
improvement. If the affected parties have any political influence, however,
potential losers will be more active and determined than potential winners;
the outcome will be biased in their favor and inevitably more expensive
and less effective than initially planned. Reforms commonly include
grandfather clauses that protect current stake-holders—for example, when
the existing workforce is reduced by attrition rather than by dismissals, or
when cuts in salaries and benefits apply only to future workers. Loss
aversion is a powerful conservative force that favors minimal changes from
the status quo in the lives of both institutions and individuals. This
conservatism helps keep us stable in our neighborhood, our marriage, and
our job; it is the gravitational force that holds our life together near the
reference point.
Loss Aversion in the Law
During the year that we spent working together in Vancouver, Richard
Thaler, Jack Knetsch, and I were drawn into a study of fairness in
economic transactions, partly because we were interested in the topic but
also because we had an opportunity as well as an obligation to make up a
new questionnaire every week. The Canadian government’s Department
of Fisheries and Oceans had a program for unemployed professionals in
Toronto, who were paid to administer telephone surveys. The large team of
interviewers worked every night and new questions were constantly
needed to keep the operation going. Through Jack Knetsch, we agreed to
generate a questionnaire every week, in four color-labeled versions. We
could ask about anything; the only constraint was that the questionnaire
should include at least one mention of fish, to make it pertinent to the
mission of the department. This went on for many months, and we treated
ourselves to an orgy of data collection.
We studied public perceptions of what constitutes unfair behavior on the
part of merchants, employers, and landlords. Our overarching question
was whether the opprobrium attached to unfairness imposes constraints
on profit seeking. We found that it does. We also found that the moral rules
by which the public evaluates what firms may or may not do draw a crucial
distinction between losses and gains. The basic principle is that the
existing wage, price, or rent sets a reference point, which has the nature of
an entitlement that must not be infringed. It is considered unfair for the firm
to impose losses on its customers or workers relative to the reference
transaction, unless it must do so to protect its own entitlement. Consider
this example:
A hardware store has been selling snow shovels for $15. The
morning after a large snowstorm, the store raises the price to
$20.
Please rate this action as:
Completely Fair Acceptable Unfair Very Unfair
The hardware store behaves appropriately according to the standard
economic model: it responds to increased demand by raising its price.
The participants in the survey did not agree: 82% rated the action Unfair or
Very Unfair. They evidently viewed the pre-blizzard price as a reference
point and the raised price as a loss that the store imposes on its
customers, not because it must but simply because it can. A basic rule of
fairness, we found, i Brro Qd, i Brrs that the exploitation of market power to
impose losses on others is unacceptable. The following example illustrates
this rule in another context (the dollar values should be adjusted for about
100% inflation since these data were collected in 1984):
A small photocopying shop has one employee who has worked
there for six months and earns $9 per hour. Business continues to
be satisfactory, but a factory in the area has closed and
unemployment has increased. Other small shops have now hired
reliable workers at $7 an hour to perform jobs similar to those
done by the photocopy shop employee. The owner of the shop
reduces the employee’s wage to $7.
The respondents did not approve: 83% considered the behavior Unfair or
Very Unfair. However, a slight variation on the question clarifies the nature
of the employer’s obligation. The background scenario of a profitable store
in an area of high unemployment is the same, but now
the current employee leaves, and the owner decides to pay a
replacement $7 an hour.
A large majority (73%) considered this action Acceptable. It appears that
the employer does not have a moral obligation to pay $9 an hour. The
entitlement is personal: the current worker has a right to retain his wage
even if market conditions would allow the employer to impose a wage cut.
The replacement worker has no entitlement to the previous worker’s
reference wage, and the employer is therefore allowed to reduce pay
without the risk of being branded unfair.
The firm has its own entitlement, which is to retain its current profit. If it
faces a threat of a loss, it is allowed to transfer the loss to others. A
substantial majority of respondents believed that it is not unfair for a firm to
reduce its workers’ wages when its profitability is falling. We described the
rules as defining dual entitlements to the firm and to individuals with whom
it interacts. When threatened, it is not unfair for the firm to be selfish. It is
not even expected to take on part of the losses; it can pass them on.
Different rules governed what the firm could do to improve its profits or
to avoid reduced profits. When a firm faced lower production costs, the
rules of fairness did not require it to share the bonanza with either its
customers or its workers. Of course, our respondents liked a firm better
and described it as more fair if it was generous when its profits increased,
but they did not brand as unfair a firm that did not share. They showed
indignation only when a firm exploited its power to break informal contracts
with workers or customers, and to impose a loss on others in order to
increase its profit. The important task for students of economic fairness is
not to identify ideal behavior but to find the line that separates acceptable
conduct from actions that invite opprobrium and punishment.
We were not optimistic when we submitted our report of this research to
the American Economic Review. Our article challenged what was then
accepted wisdom among many economists that economic behavior is
ruled by self-interest and that concerns for fairness are generally irrelevant.
We also relied on the evidence of survey responses, for which economists
generally have little respect. However, the editor of the journal sent our
article for evaluation to two economists who were not bound by those
conventions (we later learned their identity; they were the most friendly the
editor could have found). The editor made the correct call. The article is
often cited, and its conclusions Brro Qions Brr have stood the test of time.
More recent research has supported the observations of reference-
dependent fairness and has also shown that fairness concerns are
economically significant, a fact we had suspected but did not prove.
Employers who violate rules of fairness are punished by reduced
productivity, and merchants who follow unfair pricing policies can expect to
lose sales. People who learned from a new catalog that the merchant was
now charging less for a product that they had recently bought at a higher
price reduced their future purchases from that supplier by 15%, an average
loss of $90 per cus
