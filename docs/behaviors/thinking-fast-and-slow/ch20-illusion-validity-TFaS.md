The Illusion of Validity
System 1 is designed to jump to conclusions from little evidence—and it is
not designed to know the size of its jumps. Because of WYSIATI, only the
evidence at hand counts. Because of confidence by coherence, the
subjective confidence we have in our opinions reflects the coherence of the
story that System 1 and System 2 have constructed. The amount of
evidence and its quality do not count for much, because poor evidence can
make a very good story. For some of our most important beliefs we have
no evidence at all, except that people we love and trust hold these beliefs.
Considering how little we know, the confidence we have in our beliefs is
preposterous—and it is also essential.
The Illusion of Validity
Many decades ago I spent what seemed like a great deal of time under a
scorching sun, watching groups of sweaty soldiers as they solved a
problem. I was doing my national service in the Israeli Army at the time. I
had completed an undergraduate degree in psychology, and after a year
as an infantry officer was assigned to the army’s Psychology Branch,
where one of my occasional duties was to help evaluate candidates for
officer training. We used methods that had been developed by the British
Army in World War II.
One test, called the “leaderless group challenge,” was conducted on an
obstacle field. Eight candidates, strangers to each other, with all insignia of
rank removed and only numbered tags to identify them, were instructed to
lift a long log from the ground and haul it to a wall about six feet high. The
entire group had to get to the other side of the wall without the log touching
either the ground or the wall, and without anyone touching the wall. If any of
these things happened, they had to declare itsigрЉ T and start again.
There was more than one way to solve the problem. A common solution
was for the team to send several men to the other side by crawling over the
pole as it was held at an angle, like a giant fishing rod, by other members
of the group. Or else some soldiers would climb onto someone’s shoulders
and jump across. The last man would then have to jump up at the pole, held
up at an angle by the rest of the group, shinny his way along its length as
the others kept him and the pole suspended in the air, and leap safely to
the other side. Failure was common at this point, which required them to
start all over again.
As a colleague and I monitored the exercise, we made note of who took
charge, who tried to lead but was rebuffed, how cooperative each soldier
was in contributing to the group effort. We saw who seemed to be
stubborn, submissive, arrogant, patient, hot-tempered, persistent, or a
quitter. We sometimes saw competitive spite when someone whose idea
had been rejected by the group no longer worked very hard. And we saw
reactions to crisis: who berated a comrade whose mistake had caused the
whole group to fail, who stepped forward to lead when the exhausted team
had to start over. Under the stress of the event, we felt, each man’s true
nature revealed itself. Our impression of each candidate’s character was
as direct and compelling as the color of the sky.
After watching the candidates make several attempts, we had to
summarize our impressions of soldiers’ leadership abilities and
determine, with a numerical score, who should be eligible for officer
training. We spent some time discussing each case and reviewing our
impressions. The task was not difficult, because we felt we had already
seen each soldier’s leadership skills. Some of the men had looked like
strong leaders, others had seemed like wimps or arrogant fools, others
mediocre but not hopeless. Quite a few looked so weak that we ruled them
out as candidates for officer rank. When our multiple observations of each
candidate converged on a coherent story, we were completely confident in
our evaluations and felt that what we had seen pointed directly to the future.
The soldier who took over when the group was in trouble and led the team
over the wall was a leader at that moment. The obvious best guess about
how he would do in training, or in combat, was that he would be as
effective then as he had been at the wall. Any other prediction seemed
inconsistent with the evidence before our eyes.
Because our impressions of how well each soldier had performed were
generally coherent and clear, our formal predictions were just as definite. A
single score usually came to mind and we rarely experienced doubts or
formed conflicting impressions. We were quite willing to declare, “This one
will never make it,” “That fellow is mediocre, but he should do okay,” or “He
will be a star.” We felt no need to question our forecasts, moderate them,
or equivocate. If challenged, however, we were prepared to admit, “But of
course anything could happen.” We were willing to make that admission
because, despite our definite impressions about individual candidates, we
knew with certainty that our forecasts were largely useless.
The evidence that we could not forecast success accurately was
overwhelming. Every few months we had a feedback session in which we
learned how the cadets were doing at the officer-training school and could
compare our assessments against the opinions of commanders who had
been monitoring them for some time. The story was always the same: our
ability to predict performance at the school was negligible. Our forecasts
were better than blind guesses, but not by much.
We weed 
re downcast for a while after receiving the discouraging
news. But this was the army. Useful or not, there was a routine to be
followed and orders to be obeyed. Another batch of candidates arrived the
next day. We took them to the obstacle field, we faced them with the wall,
they lifted the log, and within a few minutes we saw their true natures
revealed, as clearly as before. The dismal truth about the quality of our
predictions had no effect whatsoever on how we evaluated candidates and
very little effect on the confidence we felt in our judgments and predictions
about individuals.
What happened was remarkable. The global evidence of our previous
failure should have shaken our confidence in our judgments of the
candidates, but it did not. It should also have caused us to moderate our
predictions, but it did not. We knew as a general fact that our predictions
were little better than random guesses, but we continued to feel and act as
if each of our specific predictions was valid. I was reminded of the Müller-
Lyer illusion, in which we know the lines are of equal length yet still see
them as being different. I was so struck by the analogy that I coined a term
for our experience: the illusion of validity.
I had discovered my first cognitive illusion.
Decades later, I can see many of the central themes of my thinking—and of
this book—in that old story. Our expectations for the soldiers’ future
performance were a clear instance of substitution, and of the
representativeness heuristic in particular. Having observed one hour of a
soldier’s behavior in an artificial situation, we felt we knew how well he
would face the challenges of officer training and of leadership in combat.
Our predictions were completely nonregressive—we had no reservations
about predicting failure or outstanding success from weak evidence. This
was a clear instance of WYSIATI. We had compelling impressions of the
behavior we observed and no good way to represent our ignorance of the
factors that would eventually determine how well the candidate would
perform as an officer.
Looking back, the most striking part of the story is that our knowledge of
the general rule—that we could not predict—had no effect on our
confidence in individual cases. I can see now that our reaction was similar
to that of Nisbett and Borgida’s students when they were told that most
people did not help a stranger suffering a seizure. They certainly believed
the statistics they were shown, but the base rates did not influence their
judgment of whether an individual they saw on the video would or would not
help a stranger. Just as Nisbett and Borgida showed, people are often
reluctant to infer the particular from the general.
Subjective confidence in a judgment is not a reasoned evaluation of the
probability that this judgment is correct. Confidence is a feeling, which
reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of
processing it. It is wise to take admissions of uncertainty seriously, but
declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has
constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is
true.
The Illusion of Stock-Picking Skill
In 1984, Amos and I and our friend Richard Thaler visited a Wall Street
firm. Our host, a senior investment manager, had invited us to discuss the
role of judgment biases in investing. I knew so little about finance that I did
not even know what to ask him, but I remember one exchange. “When you
sell a stock,” d n
I asked, “who buys it?” He answered with a wave in the
vague direction of the window, indicating that he expected the buyer to be
someone else very much like him. That was odd: What made one person
buy and the other sell? What did the sellers think they knew that the buyers
did not?
Since then, my questions about the stock market have hardened into a
larger puzzle: a major industry appears to be built largely on an illusion of
skill. Billions of shares are traded every day, with many people buying
each stock and others selling it to them. It is not unusual for more than 100
million shares of a single stock to change hands in one day. Most of the
buyers and sellers know that they have the same information; they
exchange the stocks primarily because they have different opinions. The
buyers think the price is too low and likely to rise, while the sellers think the
price is high and likely to drop. The puzzle is why buyers and sellers alike
think that the current price is wrong. What makes them believe they know
more about what the price should be than the market does? For most of
them, that belief is an illusion.
In its broad outlines, the standard theory of how the stock market works
is accepted by all the participants in the industry. Everybody in the
investment business has read Burton Malkiel’s wonderful book A Random
Walk Down Wall Street. Malkiel’s central idea is that a stock’s price
incorporates all the available knowledge about the value of the company
and the best predictions about the future of the stock. If some people
believe that the price of a stock will be higher tomorrow, they will buy more
of it today. This, in turn, will cause its price to rise. If all assets in a market
are correctly priced, no one can expect either to gain or to lose by trading.
Perfect prices leave no scope for cleverness, but they also protect fools
from their own folly. We now know, however, that the theory is not quite
right. Many individual investors lose consistently by trading, an
achievement that a dart-throwing chimp could not match. The first
demonstration of this startling conclusion was collected by Terry Odean, a
finance professor at UC Berkeley who was once my student.
Odean began by studying the trading records of 10,000 brokerage
accounts of individual investors spanning a seven-year period. He was
able to analyze every transaction the investors executed through that firm,
nearly 163,000 trades. This rich set of data allowed Odean to identify all
instances in which an investor sold some of his holdings in one stock and
soon afterward bought another stock. By these actions the investor
revealed that he (most of the investors were men) had a definite idea
about the future of the two stocks: he expected the stock that he chose to
buy to do better than the stock he chose to sell.
To determine whether those ideas were well founded, Odean compared
the returns of the stock the investor had sold and the stock he had bought
in its place, over the course of one year after the transaction. The results
were unequivocally bad. On average, the shares that individual traders
sold did better than those they bought, by a very substantial margin: 3.2
percentage points per year, above and beyond the significant costs of
executing the two trades.
It is important to remember that this is a statement about averages:
some individuals did much better, others did much worse. However, it is
clear that for the large majority of individual investors, taking a shower and
doing nothing would have been a better policy than implementing the ideas
that came to their minds. Later research by Odean and his colleague Brad
Barber supported this conclusion. In a paper titled “Trading Is Hazardous
to Yourt-t
 Wealth,” they showed that, on average, the most active traders
had the poorest results, while the investors who traded the least earned the
highest returns. In another paper, titled “Boys Will Be Boys,” they showed
that men acted on their useless ideas significantly more often than women,
and that as a result women achieved better investment results than men.
Of course, there is always someone on the other side of each
transaction; in general, these are financial institutions and professional
investors, who are ready to take advantage of the mistakes that individual
traders make in choosing a stock to sell and another stock to buy. Further
research by Barber and Odean has shed light on these mistakes.
Individual investors like to lock in their gains by selling “winners,” stocks
that have appreciated since they were purchased, and they hang on to
their losers. Unfortunately for them, recent winners tend to do better than
recent losers in the short run, so individuals sell the wrong stocks. They
also buy the wrong stocks. Individual investors predictably flock to
companies that draw their attention because they are in the news.
Professional investors are more selective in responding to news. These
findings provide some justification for the label of “smart money” that
finance professionals apply to themselves.
Although professionals are able to extract a considerable amount of
wealth from amateurs, few stock pickers, if any, have the skill needed to
beat the market consistently, year after year. Professional investors,
including fund managers, fail a basic test of skill: persistent achievement.
The diagnostic for the existence of any skill is the consistency of individual
differences in achievement. The logic is simple: if individual differences in
any one year are due entirely to luck, the ranking of investors and funds will
vary erratically and the year-to-year correlation will be zero. Where there is
skill, however, the rankings will be more stable. The persistence of
individual differences is the measure by which we confirm the existence of
skill among golfers, car salespeople, orthodontists, or speedy toll
collectors on the turnpike.
Mutual funds are run by highly experienced and hardworking
professionals who buy and sell stocks to achieve the best possible results
for their clients. Nevertheless, the evidence from more than fifty years of
research is conclusive: for a large majority of fund managers, the selection
of stocks is more like rolling dice than like playing poker. Typically at least
two out of every three mutual funds underperform the overall market in any
given year.
More important, the year-to-year correlation between the outcomes of
mutual funds is very small, barely higher than zero. The successful funds in
any given year are mostly lucky; they have a good roll of the dice. There is
general agreement among researchers that nearly all stock pickers,
whether they know it or not—and few of them do—are playing a game of
chance. The subjective experience of traders is that they are making
sensible educated guesses in a situation of great uncertainty. In highly
efficient markets, however, educated guesses are no more accurate than
blind guesses.
Some years ago I had an unusual opportunity to examine the illusion of
financial skill up close. I had been invited to speak to a group of investment
advisers in a firm that provided financial advice and other services to very
wealthy clients. I asked for some data to prepare my presentation and was
granted a small treasure: a spreadsheet summarizing the investment
outcomes of some twenty-five anonymous wealth advisers, for each of
eight consecutive years. Each adviser’s scoof 
re for each year was his
(most of them were men) main determinant of his year-end bonus. It was a
simple matter to rank the advisers by their performance in each year and
to determine whether there were persistent differences in skill among them
and whether the same advisers consistently achieved better returns for
their clients year after year.
To answer the question, I computed correlation coefficients between the
rankings in each pair of years: year 1 with year 2, year 1 with year 3, and
so on up through year 7 with year 8. That yielded 28 correlation
coefficients, one for each pair of years. I knew the theory and was
prepared to find weak evidence of persistence of skill. Still, I was surprised
to find that the average of the 28 correlations was .01. In other words, zero.
The consistent correlations that would indicate differences in skill were not
to be found. The results resembled what you would expect from a dice-
rolling contest, not a game of skill.
No one in the firm seemed to be aware of the nature of the game that its
stock pickers were playing. The advisers themselves felt they were
competent professionals doing a serious job, and their superiors agreed.
On the evening before the seminar, Richard Thaler and I had dinner with
some of the top executives of the firm, the people who decide on the size
of bonuses. We asked them to guess the year-to-year correlation in the
rankings of individual advisers. They thought they knew what was coming
and smiled as they said “not very high” or “performance certainly
fluctuates.” It quickly became clear, however, that no one expected the
average correlation to be zero.
Our message to the executives was that, at least when it came to
building portfolios, the firm was rewarding luck as if it were skill. This
should have been shocking news to them, but it was not. There was no
sign that they disbelieved us. How could they? After all, we had analyzed
their own results, and they were sophisticated enough to see the
implications, which we politely refrained from spelling out. We all went on
calmly with our dinner, and I have no doubt that both our findings and their
implications were quickly swept under the rug and that life in the firm went
on just as before. The illusion of skill is not only an individual aberration; it
is deeply ingrained in the culture of the industry. Facts that challenge such
basic assumptions—and thereby threaten people’s livelihood and self-
esteem—are simply not absorbed. The mind does not digest them. This is
particularly true of statistical studies of performance, which provide base-
rate information that people generally ignore when it clashes with their
personal impressions from experience.
The next morning, we reported the findings to the advisers, and their
response was equally bland. Their own experience of exercising careful
judgment on complex problems was far more compelling to them than an
obscure statistical fact. When we were done, one of the executives I had
dined with the previous evening drove me to the airport. He told me, with a
trace of defensiveness, “I have done very well for the firm and no one can
take that away from me.” I smiled and said nothing. But I thought, “Well, I
took it away from you this morning. If your success was due mostly to
chance, how much credit are you entitled to take for it?”
What Supports the Illusions of Skill and Validity?
Cognitive illusions can be more stubborn than visual illusions. What you
learned about the Müller-Lyer illusion did not change the way you see the
lines, but it changed your behavior
