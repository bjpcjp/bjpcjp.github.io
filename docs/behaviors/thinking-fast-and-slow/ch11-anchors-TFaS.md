Anchors
Amos and I once rigged a wheel of fortune. It was marked from 0 to 100,
but we had it built so that it would stop only at 10 or 65. We recruited
students of the University of Oregon as participants in our experiment. One
of us would stand in front of a small group, spin the wheel, and ask them to
write down the number on which the wheel stopped, which of course was
either 10 or 65. We then asked them two questions:
Is the percentage of African nations among UN members larger
or smaller than the number you just wrote?
What is your best guess of the percentage of African nations in
the UN?
The spin of a wheel of fortune—even one that is not rigged—cannot
possibly yield useful information about anything, and the participants in our
experiment should simply have ignored it. But they did not ignore it. The
average estimates of those who saw 10 and 65 were 25% and 45%,
respectively.
The phenomenon we were studying is so common and so important in
the everyday world that you should know its name: it is an anchoring effect.
It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity
before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable
and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to
the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor. If you
are asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you
will end up with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would
if the anchoring question referred to death at 35. If you consider how much
you should pay for a house, you will be influenced by the asking price. The
same house will appear more valuable if its listing price is high than if it is
low, even if you are determined to resist the influence of this number; and
so on—the list of anchoring effects is endless. Any number that you are
asked to consider as a possible solution to an estimation problem will
induce an anchoring effect.
We were not the first to observe the effects of anchors, but our
experiment was the first demonstration of its absurdity: people’s judgments
were influenced by an obviously uninformative number. There was no way
to describe the anchoring effect of a wheel of fortune as reasonable. Amos
and I published the experiment in our Science paper, and it is one of the
best known of the findings we reported there.
There was only one trouble: Amos and I did not fully agree on the
psychology of the anchoring effect. He supported one interpretation, I liked
another, and we never found a way to settle the argument. The problem
was finally solved decades later by the efforts of numerous investigators. It
is now clear that Amos and I were both right. Two different mechanisms
produce anchoring effects—one for each system. There is a form of
anchoring that occurs in a deliberate process of adjustment, an operation
of System 2. And there is anchoring that occurs by a priming effect, an
automatic manifestation of System 1.
Anchoring as Adjustment
Amos liked the idea of an adjust-and-anchor heuristic as a strategy for
estimating uncertain quantities: start from an anchoring number, assess
whether it is too high or too low, and gradually adjust your estimate by
mentally “moving” from the anchor. The adjustment typically ends
prematurely, because people stop when they are no longer certain that
they should move farther. Decades after our disagreement, and years after
Amos’s death, convincing evidence of such a process was offered
independently by two psychologists who had worked closely with Amos
early in their careers: Eldar Shafir and Tom Gilovich together with their own
students—Amos’s intellectual grandchildren!
To get the idea, take a sheet of paper and draw a 2½-inch line going up,
starting at the bottom of the page—without a ruler. Now take another sheet,
and start at the top and draw a line going down until it is 2½ inches from
the bottom. Compare the lines. There is a good chance that your first
estimate of 2½ inches was shorter than the second. The reason is that you
do not know exactly what such a line looks like; there is a range of
uncertainty. You stop near the bottom of the region of uncertainty when you
start from the bottom of the page and near the top of the region when you
start from the top. Robyn Le Boeuf and Shafir found many examples of that
mechanism in daily experience. Insufficient adjustment neatly explains why
you are likely to drive too fast when you come off the highway onto city
streets—especially if you are talking with someone as you drive.
Insufficient adjustment is also a source of tension between exasperated
parents and teenagers who enjoy loud music in their room. Le Boeuf and
Shafir note that a “well-intentioned child who turns down exceptionally loud
music to meet a parent’s demand that it be played at a ‘reasonable’
volume may fail to adjust sufficiently from a high anchor, and may feel that
genuine attempts at compromise are being overlooked.” The driver and
the child both deliberately adjust down, and both fail to adjust enough.
Now consider these questions:
When did George Washington become president?
What is the boiling temperature of water at the top of Mount
Everest?
The first thing that happens when you consider each of these questions is
that an anchor comes to your mind, and you know both that it is wrong and
the direction of the correct answer. You know immediately that George
Washington became president after 1776, and you also know that the
boiling temperature of water at the top of Mount Everest is lower than
100°C. You have to adjust in the appropriate direction by finding
arguments to move away from the anchor. As in the case of the lines, you
are likely to stop when you are no longer sure you should go farther—at the
near edge of the region of uncertainty.
Nick Epley and Tom Gilovich found evidence that adjustment is a
deliberate attempt to find reasons to move away from the anchor: people
who are instructed to shake their head when they hear the anchor, as if
they rejected it, move farther from the anchor, and people who nod their
head show enhanced anchoring. Epley and Gilovich also confirmed that
adjustment is an effortful operation. People adjust less (stay closer to the
anchor) when their mental resources are depleted, either because their
memory is loaded with dighdth=igits or because they are slightly drunk.
Insufficient adjustment is a failure of a weak or lazy System 2.
So we now know that Amos was right for at least some cases of
anchoring, which involve a deliberate System 2 adjustment in a specified
direction from an anchor.
Anchoring as Priming Effect
When Amos and I debated anchoring, I agreed that adjustment sometimes
occurs, but I was uneasy. Adjustment is a deliberate and conscious
activity, but in most cases of anchoring there is no corresponding
subjective experience. Consider these two questions:
Was Gandhi more or less than 144 years old when he died?
How old was Gandhi when he died?
Did you produce your estimate by adjusting down from 144? Probably not,
but the absurdly high number still affected your estimate. My hunch was that
anchoring is a case of suggestion. This is the word we use when someone
causes us to see, hear, or feel something by merely bringing it to mind. For
example, the question “Do you now feel a slight numbness in your left leg?”
always prompts quite a few people to report that their left leg does indeed
feel a little strange.
Amos was more conservative than I was about hunches, and he correctly
pointed out that appealing to suggestion did not help us understand
anchoring, because we did not know how to explain suggestion. I had to
agree that he was right, but I never became enthusiastic about the idea of
insufficient adjustment as the sole cause of anchoring effects. We
conducted many inconclusive experiments in an effort to understand
anchoring, but we failed and eventually gave up the idea of writing more
about it.
The puzzle that defeated us is now solved, because the concept of
suggestion is no longer obscure: suggestion is a priming effect, which
selectively evokes compatible evidence. You did not believe for a moment
that Gandhi lived for 144 years, but your associative machinery surely
generated an impression of a very ancient person. System 1 understands
sentences by trying to make them true, and the selective activation of
compatible thoughts produces a family of systematic errors that make us
gullible and prone to believe too strongly whatever we believe. We can now
see why Amos and I did not realize that there were two types of anchoring:
the research techniques and theoretical ideas we needed did not yet exist.
They were developed, much later, by other people. A process that
resembles suggestion is indeed at work in many situations: System 1 tries
its best to construct a world in which the anchor is the true number. This is
one of the manifestations of associative coherence that I described in the
first part of the book.
The German psychologists Thomas Mussweiler and Fritz Strack offered
the most compelling demonstrations of the role of associative coherence
in anchoring. In one experiment, they asked an anchoring question about
temperature: “Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher or lower
than 20°C (68°F)?” or “Is the annual mean temperature in Germany higher
or lower than 5°C (40°F)?”
All participants were then briefly shown words that they were asked to
identify. The researchers found that 68°F made it easier to recognize
summer words (like sun and beach), and 40°F facilitated winter words
(like frost and ski). The selective activation of compatible memories
explains anchoring: the high and the low numbers activate different sets of
ideas in memory. The estimates of annual temperature draw on these
biased samples of ideas and are therefore biased as well. In another
elegant study in the same vein, participants were asked about the average
price of German cars. A high anchor selectively primed the names of luxury
brands (Mercedes, Audi), whereas the low anchor primed brands
associated with mass-market cars (Volkswagen). We saw earlier that any
prime will tend to evoke information that is compatible with it. Suggestion
and anchoring are both explained by the same automatic operation of
System 1. Although I did not know how to prove it at the time, my hunch
about the link between anchoring and suggestion turned out to be correct.
The Anchoring Index
Many psychological phenomena can be demonstrated experimentally, but
few can actually be measured. The effect of anchors is an exception.
Anchoring can be measured, and it is an impressively large effect. Some
visitors at the San Francisco Exploratorium were asked the following two
questions:
Is the height of the tallest redwood more or less than 1,200 feet?
What is your best guess about the height of the tallest redwood?
The “high anchor” in this experiment was 1,200 feet. For other participants,
the first question referred to a “low anchor” of 180 feet. The difference
between the two anchors was 1,020 feet.
As expected, the two groups produced very different mean estimates:
844 and 282 feet. The difference between them was 562 feet. The
anchoring index is simply the ratio of the two differences (562/1,020)
expressed as a percentage: 55%. The anchoring measure would be 100%
for people who slavishly adopt the anchor as an estimate, and zero for
people who are able to ignore the anchor altogether. The value of 55% that
was observed in this example is typical. Similar values have been
observed in numerous other problems.
The anchoring effect is not a laboratory curiosity; it can be just as strong
in the real world. In an experiment conducted some years ago, real-estate
agents were given an opportunity to assess the value of a house that was
actually on the market. They visited the house and studied a
comprehensive booklet of information that included an asking price. Half
the agents saw an asking price that was substantially higher than the listed
price of the house; the other half saw an asking price that was substantially
lower. Each agent gave her opinion about a reasonable buying price for
the house and the lowest price at which she would agree to sell the house
if she owned it. The agents were then asked about the factors that had
affected their judgment. Remarkably, the asking price was not one of these
factors; the agents took pride in their ability to ignore it. They insisted that
the listing price had no effect on their responses, but they were wrong: the
anchoring effect was 41%. Indeed, the professionals were almost as
susceptible to anchoring effects as business school students with no real-
estate experience, whose anchoring index was 48%. The only difference
between the two groups was that the students conceded that they were
influenced by the anchor, while the professionals denied that influence.
Powerful anchoring effects are found in decisions that people make
about money, such as when they choose how much to contribute al.ls
denied to a cause. To demonstrate this effect, we told participants in the
Exploratorium study about the environmental damage caused by oil
tankers in the Pacific Ocean and asked about their willingness to make an
annual contribution “to save 50,000 offshore Pacific Coast seabirds from
small offshore oil spills, until ways are found to prevent spills or require
tanker owners to pay for the operation.” This question requires intensity
matching: the respondents are asked, in effect, to find the dollar amount of
a contribution that matches the intensity of their feelings about the plight of
the seabirds. Some of the visitors were first asked an anchoring question,
such as, “Would you be willing to pay $5…,” before the point-blank
question of how much they would contribute.
When no anchor was mentioned, the visitors at the Exploratorium—
generally an environmentally sensitive crowd—said they were willing to pay
$64, on average. When the anchoring amount was only $5, contributions
averaged $20. When the anchor was a rather extravagant $400, the
willingness to pay rose to an average of $143.
The difference between the high-anchor and low-anchor groups was
$123. The anchoring effect was above 30%, indicating that increasing the
initial request by $100 brought a return of $30 in average willingness to
pay.
Similar or even larger anchoring effects have been obtained in
numerous studies of estimates and of willingness to pay. For example,
French residents of the heavily polluted Marseilles region were asked what
increase in living costs they would accept if they could live in a less
polluted region. The anchoring effect was over 50% in that study.
Anchoring effects are easily observed in online trading, where the same
item is often offered at different “buy now” prices. The “estimate” in fine-art
auctions is also an anchor that influences the first bid.
There are situations in which anchoring appears reasonable. After all, it
is not surprising that people who are asked difficult questions clutch at
straws, and the anchor is a plausible straw. If you know next to nothing
about the trees of California and are asked whether a redwood can be
taller than 1,200 feet, you might infer that this number is not too far from the
truth. Somebody who knows the true height thought up that question, so the
anchor may be a valuable hint. However, a key finding of anchoring
research is that anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective
as potentially informative anchors. When we used a wheel of fortune to
anchor estimates of the proportion of African nations in the UN, the
anchoring index was 44%, well within the range of effects observed with
anchors that could plausibly be taken as hints. Anchoring effects of similar
size have been observed in experiments in which the last few digits of the
respondent’s Social Security number was used as the anchor (e.g., for
estimating the number of physicians in their city). The conclusion is clear:
anchors do not have their effects because people believe they are
informative.
The power of random anchors has been demonstrated in some
unsettling ways. German judges with an average of more than fifteen years
of experience on the bench first read a description of a woman who had
been caught shoplifting, then rolled a pair of dice that were loaded so
every roll resulted in either a 3 or a 9. As soon as the dice came to a stop,
the judges were asked whether they would sentence the woman to a term
in prison greater or lesser, in months, than the number showing on the
dice. Finally, the judges were instructed to specify the exact prison
sentence they would give to the shoplifter. On average, those who had
rolled a 9 said they would sentence her to 8 months; those who rolled a 3
saidthif Africa they would sentence her to 5 months; the anchoring effect
was 50%.
Uses and Abuses of Anchors
By now you should be convinced that anchoring effects—sometimes due
to priming, sometimes to insufficient adjustment—are everywhere. The
psychological mechanisms that produce anchoring make us far more
suggestible than most of us would want to be. And of course there are
quite a few people who are willing and able to exploit our gullibility.
Anchoring effects explain why, for example, arbitrary rationing is an
effective marketing ploy. A few years ago, supermarket shoppers in Sioux
City, Iowa, encountered a sales promotion for Campbell’s soup at about
10% off the regular price. On some days, a sign on the shelf said limit of
12 per person. On other days, the sign said no limit per person. Shoppers
purchased an average of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many
as they bought when the limit was removed. Anchoring is not the sole
explanation. Rationing also implies that the goods are flying off the
shelves, and shoppers should feel some urgency about stocking up. But
we also know that the mention of 12 cans as a possible purchase would
produce anchoring even if the number were produced by a roulette wheel.
We see the same strategy at work in the negotiation over the price of a
home, when the seller makes the first move by setting the list price. As in
many other games, moving first is an advantage in single-issue
negotiations—for example, when price is the only issue to be settled
between a buyer and a seller. As you may have experienced when
negotiating for the first time in a bazaar, the initial anchor has a powerful
effect. My advice to students when I taught negotiations was that if you
think the other side has made an outrageous proposal, you should not
come back with an equally outrageous counteroffer, creating a gap that will
be difficult to bridge in further negotiations. Instead you should make a
scene, storm out or threaten to do so, and make it clear—to yourself as
well as to the other side—that you will not continue the negotiation with that
number on the table.
The psychologists Adam Galinsky and Thomas Mussweiler proposed
more subtle ways to resist the anchoring effect in negotiations. They
instructed negotiators to focus their attention and search their memory for
arguments against the anchor. The instruction to activate System 2 was
successful. For example, the anchoring effect is reduced or eliminated
when the second mover focuses his attention on the minimal offer that the
opponent would accept, or on the costs to the opponent of failing to reach
an agreement. In general, a strategy of deliberately “thinking the opposite”
may be a good defense against anchoring effects, because it negates the
biased recruitment of thoughts that produces these effects.
Finally, try your hand at working out the effect of anchoring on a problem
of public policy: the size of damages in personal injury cases. These
awards are sometimes very large. Businesses that are frequent targets of
such lawsuits, such as hospitals and chemical companies, have lobbied to
set a cap on the awards. Before you read this chapter you
