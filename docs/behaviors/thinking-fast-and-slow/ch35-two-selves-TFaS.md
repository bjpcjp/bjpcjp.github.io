Two Selves
The term utility has had two distinct meanings in its long history. Jeremy
Bentham opened his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation with the famous sentence “Nature has placed mankind under
the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them
alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we
shall do.” In an awkward footnote, Bentham apologized for applying the
word utility to these experiences, saying that he had been unable to find a
better word. To distinguish Bentham’s interpretation of the term, I will call it
experienced utility.
For the last 100 years, economists have used the same word to mean
something else. As economists and decision theorists apply the term, it
means “wantability”—and I have called it decision utility. Expected utility
theory, for example, is entirely about the rules of rationality that should
govern decision utilities; it has nothing at all to say about hedonic
experiences. Of course, the two concepts of utility will coincide if people
want what they will enjoy, and enjoy what they chose for themselves—and
this assumption of coincidence is implicit in the general idea that
economic agents are rational. Rational agents are expected to know their
tastes, both present and future, and they are supposed to make good
decisions that will maximize these interests.
Experienced Utility
My fascination with the possible discrepancies between experienced utility
and decision utility goes back a long way. While Amos and I were still
working on prospect theory, I formulated a puzzle, which went like this:
imagine an individual who receives one painful injection every day. There
is no adaptation; the pain is the same day to day. Will people attach the
same value to reducing the number of planned injections from 20 to 18 as
from 6 to 4? Is there any justification for a distinction?
I did not collect data, because the outcome was evident. You can verify
for yourself that you would pay more to reduce the number of injections by
a third (from 6 to 4) than by one tenth (from 20 to 18). The decision utility of
avoiding two injections is higher in the first case than in the second, and
everyone will pay more for the first reduction than for the second. But this
difference is absurd. If the pain does not change from day to day, what
could justify assigning different utilities to a reduction of the total amount of
pain by two injections, depending on the number of previous injections? In
the terms we would use today, the puzzle introduced the idea that
experienced utility could be measured by the number of injections. It also
suggested that, at least in some cases, experienced utility is the criterion
by which a decision should be assessed. A decision maker who pays
different amounts to achieve the same gain of experienced utility (or be
spared the same loss) is making a mistake. You may find this observation
obvious, but in decision theory the only basis for judging that a decision is
wrong is inconsistency with other preferences. Amos and I discussed the
problem but we did not pursue it. Many years later, I returned to it.
Experience and Memory
How can experienced utility be measured? How should we answer
questions such as “How much pain did Helen suffer during the medical
procedure?” or “How much enjoyment did she get from her 20 minutes on
the beach?” T Jon e t8221; T Jhe British economist Francis Edgeworth
speculated about this topic in the nineteenth century and proposed the
idea of a “hedonimeter,” an imaginary instrument analogous to the devices
used in weather-recording stations, which would measure the level of
pleasure or pain that an individual experiences at any moment.
Experienced utility would vary, much as daily temperature or barometric
pressure do, and the results would be plotted as a function of time. The
answer to the question of how much pain or pleasure Helen experienced
during her medical procedure or vacation would be the “area under the
curve.” Time plays a critical role in Edgeworth’s conception. If Helen stays
on the beach for 40 minutes instead of 20, and her enjoyment remains as
intense, then the total experienced utility of that episode doubles, just as
doubling the number of injections makes a course of injections twice as
bad. This was Edgeworth’s theory, and we now have a precise
understanding of the conditions under which his theory holds.
The graphs in figure 15 show profiles of the experiences of two patients
undergoing a painful colonoscopy, drawn from a study that Don
Redelmeier and I designed together. Redelmeier, a physician and
researcher at the University of Toronto, carried it out in the early 1990s.
This procedure is now routinely administered with an anesthetic as well as
an amnesic drug, but these drugs were not as widespread when our data
were collected. The patients were prompted every 60 seconds to indicate
the level of pain they experienced at the moment. The data shown are on a
scale where zero is “no pain at all” and 10 is “intolerable pain.” As you can
see, the experience of each patient varied considerably during the
procedure, which lasted 8 minutes for patient A and 24 minutes for patient
B (the last reading of zero pain was recorded after the end of the
procedure). A total of 154 patients participated in the experiment; the
shortest procedure lasted 4 minutes, the longest 69 minutes.
Next, consider an easy question: Assuming that the two patients used
the scale of pain similarly, which patient suffered more? No contest. There
is general agreement that patient B had the worse time. Patient B spent at
least as much time as patient A at any level of pain, and the “area under
the curve” is clearly larger for B than for A. The key factor, of course, is that
B’s procedure lasted much longer. I will call the measures based on
reports of momentary pain hedonimeter totals.
Figure 15
When the procedure was over, all participants were asked to rate “the
total amount of pain” they had experienced during the procedure. The
wording was intended to encourage them to think of the integral of the pain
they had reported, reproducing the hedonimeter totals. Surprisingly, the
patients did nothing of the kind. The statistical analysis revealed two
findings, which illustrate a pattern we have observed in other experiments:
 
Peak-end rule: The global retrospective rating was well predicted by
the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the
experience and at its end.
Duration neglect: The duration of the procedure had no effect
whatsoever on the ratings of total pain.
You can now apply these rules to the profiles of patients A and B. The
worst rati Jon er soever on ng (8 on the 10-point scale) was the same for
both patients, but the last rating before the end of the procedure was 7 for
patient A and only 1 for patient B. The peak-end average was therefore 7.5
for patient A and only 4.5 for patient B. As expected, patient A retained a
much worse memory of the episode than patient B. It was the bad luck of
patient A that the procedure ended at a bad moment, leaving him with an
unpleasant memory.
We now have an embarrassment of riches: two measures of
experienced utility—the hedonimeter total and the retrospective
assessment—that are systematically different. The hedonimeter totals are
computed by an observer from an individual’s report of the experience of
moments. We call these judgments duration-weighted, because the
computation of the “area under the curve” assigns equal weights to all
moments: two minutes of pain at level 9 is twice as bad as one minute at
the same level of pain. However, the findings of this experiment and others
show that the retrospective assessments are insensitive to duration and
weight two singular moments, the peak and the end, much more than
others. So which should matter? What should the physician do? The
choice has implications for medical practice. We noted that:
 
If the objective is to reduce patients’ memory of pain, lowering the
peak intensity of pain could be more important than minimizing the
duration of the procedure. By the same reasoning, gradual relief may
be preferable to abrupt relief if patients retain a better memory when
the pain at the end of the procedure is relatively mild.
If the objective is to reduce the amount of pain actually experienced,
conducting the procedure swiftly may be appropriate even if doing so
increases the peak pain intensity and leaves patients with an awful
memory.
Which of the two objectives did you find most compelling? I have not
conducted a proper survey, but my impression is that a strong majority will
come down in favor of reducing the memory of pain. I find it helpful to think
of this dilemma as a conflict of interests between two selves (which do not
correspond to the two familiar systems). The experiencing self is the one
that answers the question: “Does it hurt now?” The remembering self is the
one that answers the question: “How was it, on the whole?” Memories are
all we get to keep from our experience of living, and the only perspective
that we can adopt as we think about our lives is therefore that of the
remembering self.
A comment I heard from a member of the audience after a lecture
illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing memories from experiences. He
told of listening raptly to a long symphony on a disc that was scratched
near the end, producing a shocking sound, and he reported that the bad
ending “ruined the whole experience.” But the experience was not actually
ruined, only the memory of it. The experiencing self had had an experience
that was almost entirely good, and the bad end could not undo it, because
it had already happened. My questioner had assigned the entire episode a
failing grade because it had ended very badly, but that grade effectively
ignored 40 minutes of musical bliss. Does the actual experience count for
nothing?
Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive
illusion—and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience
can be ruined. The experiencing self does not have a voice. The
remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps score
and governs what we learn from living, and it is the one that makes
decisions Jon thaperienci. What we learn from the past is to maximize the
qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience.
This is the tyranny of the remembering self.
Which Self Should Count?
To demonstrate the decision-making power of the remembering self, my
colleagues and I designed an experiment, using a mild form of torture that I
will call the cold-hand situation (its ugly technical name is cold-pressor).
Participants are asked to hold their hand up to the wrist in painfully cold
water until they are invited to remove it and are offered a warm towel. The
subjects in our experiment used their free hand to control arrows on a
keyboard to provide a continuous record of the pain they were enduring, a
direct communication from their experiencing self. We chose a
temperature that caused moderate but tolerable pain: the volunteer
participants were of course free to remove their hand at any time, but none
chose to do so.
Each participant endured two cold-hand episodes:
The short episode consisted of 60 seconds of immersion in
water at 14° Celsius, which is experienced as painfully cold, but
not intolerable. At the end of the 60 seconds, the experimenter
instructed the participant to remove his hand from the water and
offered a warm towel.
The long episode lasted 90 seconds. Its first 60 seconds were
identical to the short episode. The experimenter said nothing at
all at the end of the 60 seconds. Instead he opened a valve that
allowed slightly warmer water to flow into the tub. During the
additional 30 seconds, the temperature of the water rose by
roughly 1°, just enough for most subjects to detect a slight
decrease in the intensity of pain.
Our participants were told that they would have three cold-hand trials, but in
fact they experienced only the short and the long episodes, each with a
different hand. The trials were separated by seven minutes. Seven minutes
after the second trial, the participants were given a choice about the third
trial. They were told that one of their experiences would be repeated
exactly, and were free to choose whether to repeat the experience they
had had with their left hand or with their right hand. Of course, half the
participants had the short trial with the left hand, half with the right; half had
the short trial first, half began with the long, etc. This was a carefully
controlled experiment.
The experiment was designed to create a conflict between the interests
of the experiencing and the remembering selves, and also between
experienced utility and decision utility. From the perspective of the
experiencing self, the long trial was obviously worse. We expected the
remembering self to have another opinion. The peak-end rule predicts a
worse memory for the short than for the long trial, and duration neglect
predicts that the difference between 90 seconds and 60 seconds of pain
will be ignored. We therefore predicted that the participants would have a
more favorable (or less unfavorable) memory of the long trial and choose
to repeat it. They did. Fully 80% of the participants who reported that their
pain diminished during the final phase of the longer episode opted to
repeat it, thereby declaring themselves willing to suffer 30 seconds of
needless pain in the anticipated third trial.
The subjects who preferred the long episode were not masochists and
did not deliberately choose to expose themselves to the worse experience;
they simply Jon the heigmade a mistake. If we had asked them, “Would
you prefer a 90-second immersion or only the first part of it?” they would
certainly have selected the short option. We did not use these words,
however, and the subjects did what came naturally: they chose to repeat
the episode of which they had the less aversive memory. The subjects
knew quite well which of the two exposures was longer—we asked them—
but they did not use that knowledge. Their decision was governed by a
simple rule of intuitive choice: pick the option you like the most, or dislike
the least. Rules of memory determined how much they disliked the two
options, which in turn determined their choice. The cold-hand experiment,
like my old injections puzzle, revealed a discrepancy between decision
utility and experienced utility.
The preferences we observed in this experiment are another example of
the less-is-more effect that we have encountered on previous occasions.
One was Christopher Hsee’s study in which adding dishes to a set of 24
dishes lowered the total value because some of the added dishes were
broken. Another was Linda, the activist woman who is judged more likely
to be a feminist bank teller than a bank teller. The similarity is not
accidental. The same operating feature of System 1 accounts for all three
situations: System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes,
not by sums. Each cold-hand episode is a set of moments, which the
remembering self stores as a prototypical moment. This leads to a conflict.
For an objective observer evaluating the episode from the reports of the
experiencing self, what counts is the “area under the curve” that integrates
pain over time; it has the nature of a sum. The memory that the
remembering self keeps, in contrast, is a representative moment, strongly
influenced by the peak and the end.
Of course, evolution could have designed animals’ memory to store
integrals, as it surely does in some cases. It is important for a squirrel to
“know” the total amount of food it has stored, and a representation of the
average size of the nuts would not be a good substitute. However, the
integral of pain or pleasure over time may be less biologically significant.
We know, for example, that rats show duration neglect for both pleasure
and pain. In one experiment, rats were consistently exposed to a sequence
in which the onset of a light signals that an electric shock will soon be
delivered. The rats quickly learned to fear the light, and the intensity of their
fear could be measured by several physiological responses. The main
finding was that the duration of the shock has little or no effect on fear—all
that matters is the painful intensity of the stimulus.
Other classic studies showed that electrical stimulation of specific areas
in the rat brain (and of corresponding areas in the human brain) produce a
sensation of intense pleasure, so intense in some cases that rats who can
stimulate their brain by pressing a lever will die of starvation without taking
a break to feed themselves. Pleasurable electric stimulation can be
delivered in bursts that vary in intensity and duration. Here again, only
intensity matters. Up to a point, increasing the duration of a burst of
stimulation does not appear to increase the eagerness of the animal to
obtain it. The rules that govern the remembering self of humans have a
long evolutionary history.
Biology vs. Rationality
The most useful idea in the injections puzzle that preoccupied me years
ago was that the experienced utility of a series of equally painful injections
can be measured, by simply counting the injections. If all injections are
equally aversive, then 20 of them are twice as bad as 10, and Jon e oe e a
reduction from 20 to 18 and a reduction from 6 to 4 are equally valuable. If
the decision utility does not correspond to the experienced utility, then
something is wrong with the decision. The same logic played out in the
cold-hand experiment: an episode of pain that lasts 90 seconds is worse
than the first 60 seconds of that episode. If people willingly choose to
endure the longer episode, something is wrong with their decision. In my
early puzzle, the discrepancy between the decision and the experience
originated from diminishing sensitivity: the difference between 18 and 20
is less impressive, and appears to be worth less, than the difference
between 6 and 4 injections. In the cold-hand experiment, the error reflects
two principles of memory: duration neglect and the peak-end rule. The
mechanisms are different but the outcome is the same: a decision that is
not correctly attuned to the experience.
Decisions that do not produce the best possible experience and
erroneous forecasts of future feelings—both are bad news for believers in
the rationality of choice. The cold-hand study showed that we cannot fully
trust our preferences to reflect our interests, even if they are based on
personal experience, and even if the memory of that experience was laid
down within the last quarter of an hour! Tastes and decisions are shaped
by memories, and the memories can be wrong. The evidence presents a
profound challenge to the idea that humans have consistent preferences
and know how to maximize them, a cornerstone of the rational-agent
model. An inconsistency is built into the design of our minds. We have
strong preferences about the duration of our experiences of pain and
pleasure. We want pain to be brief and pleasure to last. But our memory, a
function of System 1, has evolved to represent the most intense moment of
an episode of pain or pleasure (the peak) and the feelings when the
episode was at its end. A memory that neglects duration will not serve our
preference for long pleasure and short pains.
Speaking of Two Selves
“You are thinking of your failed marriage entirely from the
perspective of the remembering self. A divorce is like a
symphony with a screeching sound at the end—the fact that it
ended badly does not mean it was all bad.”
“This is a bad case of duration neglect. You are giving the good
and the bad part of your experience equal weight, although the
good part lasted ten times as long as the other.”
