Cognitive Ease
Whenever you are conscious, and perhaps even when you are not, multiple
computations are going on in your brain, which maintain and update
current answers to some key questions: Is anything new going on? Is there
a threat? Are things going well? Should my attention be redirected? Is
more effort needed for this task? You can think of a cockpit, with a set of
dials that indicate the current values of each of these essential variables.
The assessments are carried out automatically by System 1, and one of
their functions is to determine whether extra effort is required from System
2.
One of the dials measures cognitive ease, and its range is between
“Easy” and “Strained.” Easy is a sign that things are going well—no
threats, no major news, no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort.
Strained indicates that a problem exists, which will require increased
mobilization of System 2. Conversely, you experience cognitive strain.
Cognitive strain is affected by both the current level of effort and the
presence of unmet demands. The surprise is that a single dial of cognitive
ease is connected to a large network of diverse inputs and outputs. Figure
5 tells the story.
The figure suggests that a sentence that is printed in a clear font, or has
been repeated, or has been primed, will be fluently processed with
cognitive ease. Hearing a speaker when you are in a good mood, or even
when you have a pencil stuck crosswise in your mouth to make you “smile,”
also induces cognitive ease. Conversely, you experience cognitive strain
when you read instructions in a poor font, or in faint colors, or worded in
complicated language, or when you are in a bad mood, and even when you
frown.
Figure 5. Causes and Consequences of
Cognitive Ease
The various causes of ease or strain have interchangeable effects.
When you are in a state of cognitive ease, you are probably in a good
mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, and
feel that the current situation is comfortably familiar. You are also likely to
be relatively casual and superficial in your thinking. When you feel strained,
you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious, invest more effort in what
you are doing, feel less comfortable, and make fewer errors, but you also
are less intuitive and less creative than usual.
Illusions of Remembering
The word illusion brings visual illusions to mind, because we are all
familiar with pictures that mislead. But vision is not the only domain of
illusions; memory is also susceptible to them, as is thinking more
generally.
David Stenbill, Monica Bigoutski, Sh"imight=s is pictana Tirana. I just
made up these names. If you encounter any of them within the next few
minutes you are likely to remember where you saw them. You know, and
will know for a while, that these are not the names of minor celebrities. But
suppose that a few days from now you are shown a long list of names,
including some minor celebrities and “new” names of people that you have
never heard of; your task will be to check every name of a celebrity in the
list. There is a substantial probability that you will identify David Stenbill as
a well-known person, although you will not (of course) know whether you
encountered his name in the context of movies, sports, or politics. Larry
Jacoby, the psychologist who first demonstrated this memory illusion in the
laboratory, titled his article “Becoming Famous Overnight.” How does this
happen? Start by asking yourself how you know whether or not someone is
famous. In some cases of truly famous people (or of celebrities in an area
you follow), you have a mental file with rich information about a person—
think Albert Einstein, Bono, Hillary Clinton. But you will have no file of
information about David Stenbill if you encounter his name in a few days.
All you will have is a sense of familiarity—you have seen this name
somewhere.
Jacoby nicely stated the problem: “The experience of familiarity has a
simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a
direct reflection of prior experience.” This quality of pastness is an illusion.
The truth is, as Jacoby and many followers have shown, that the name
David Stenbill will look familiar when you see it because you will see it
more clearly. Words that you have seen before become easier to see
again—you can identify them better than other words when they are shown
very briefly or masked by noise, and you will be quicker (by a few
hundredths of a second) to read them than to read other words. In short,
you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen
earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of
familiarity.
Figure 5 suggests a way to test this. Choose a completely new word,
make it easier to see, and it will be more likely to have the quality of
pastness. Indeed, a new word is more likely to be recognized as familiar if
it is unconsciously primed by showing it for a few milliseconds just before
the test, or if it is shown in sharper contrast than some other words in the
list. The link also operates in the other direction. Imagine you are shown a
list of words that are more or less out of focus. Some of the words are
severely blurred, others less so, and your task is to identify the words that
are shown more clearly. A word that you have seen recently will appear to
be clearer than unfamiliar words. As figure 5 indicates, the various ways of
inducing cognitive ease or strain are interchangeable; you may not know
precisely what it is that makes things cognitively easy or strained. This is
how the illusion of familiarity comes about.
Illusions of Truth
“New York is a large city in the United States.” “The moon revolves around
Earth.” “A chicken has four legs.” In all these cases, you quickly retrieved a
great deal of related information, almost all pointing one way or another.
You knew soon after reading them that the first two statements are true and
the last one is false. Note, however, that the statement “A chicken has
three legs” is more obviously false than “A chicken has four legs.” Your
associative machinery slows the judgment of the latter sentence by
delivering the fact that many animals have four legs, and perhaps also that
supermarkets often sell chickenordblurred, legs in packages of four.
System 2 was involved in sifting that information, perhaps raising the issue
of whether the question about New York was too easy, or checking the
meaning of revolves.
Think of the last time you took a driving test. Is it true that you need a
special license to drive a vehicle that weighs more than three tons?
Perhaps you studied seriously and can remember the side of the page on
which the answer appeared, as well as the logic behind it. This is certainly
not how I passed driving tests when I moved to a new state. My practice
was to read the booklet of rules quickly once and hope for the best. I knew
some of the answers from the experience of driving for a long time. But
there were questions where no good answer came to mind, where all I had
to go by was cognitive ease. If the answer felt familiar, I assumed that it
was probably true. If it looked new (or improbably extreme), I rejected it.
The impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2
relies on that impression for a true/false judgment.
The lesson of figure 5 is that predictable illusions inevitably occur if a
judgment is based on an impression of cognitive ease or strain. Anything
that makes it easier for the associative machine to run smoothly will also
bias beliefs. A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is
frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from
truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.
But it was psychologists who discovered that you do not have to repeat the
entire statement of a fact or idea to make it appear true. People who were
repeatedly exposed to the phrase “the body temperature of a chicken”
were more likely to accept as true the statement that “the body temperature
of a chicken is 144°” (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one
phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar,
and therefore true. If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and
have no way to relate it to other things you know, you have no option but to
go with the sense of cognitive ease.
How to Write a Persuasive Message
Suppose you must write a message that you want the recipients to believe.
Of course, your message will be true, but that is not necessarily enough for
people to believe that it is true. It is entirely legitimate for you to enlist
cognitive ease to work in your favor, and studies of truth illusions provide
specific suggestions that may help you achieve this goal.
The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive
strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility. Compare these two
statements:
Adolf Hitler was born in 1892.
Adolf Hitler was born in 1887.
Both are false (Hitler was born in 1889), but experiments have shown that
the first is more likely to be believed. More advice: if your message is to be
printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between
characters and their background. If you use color, you are more likely to be
believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades
of green, yellow, or pale blue.
If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use
complex language where simpler language will do. My Princeton ton
colleague Danny Oppenheimer refuted a myth prevalent a wo ton colmong
undergraduates about the vocabulary that professors find most impressive.
In an article titled “Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized
Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly,”
he showed that couching familiar ideas in pretentious language is taken as
a sign of poor intelligence and low credibility.
In addition to making your message simple, try to make it memorable.
Put your ideas in verse if you can; they will be more likely to be taken as
truth. Participants in a much cited experiment read dozens of unfamiliar
aphorisms, such as:
Woes unite foes.
Little strokes will tumble great oaks.
A fault confessed is half redressed.
Other students read some of the same proverbs transformed into
nonrhyming versions:
Woes unite enemies.
Little strokes will tumble great trees.
A fault admitted is half redressed.
The aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed than when
they did not.
Finally, if you quote a source, choose one with a name that is easy to
pronounce. Participants in an experiment were asked to evaluate the
prospects of fictitious Turkish companies on the basis of reports from two
brokerage firms. For each stock, one of the reports came from an easily
pronounced name (e.g., Artan) and the other report came from a firm with
an unfortunate name (e.g., Taahhut). The reports sometimes disagreed.
The best procedure for the observers would have been to average the two
reports, but this is not what they did. They gave much more weight to the
report from Artan than to the report from Taahhut. Remember that System
2 is lazy and that mental effort is aversive. If possible, the recipients of your
message want to stay away from anything that reminds them of effort,
including a source with a complicated name.
All this is very good advice, but we should not get carried away. High-
quality paper, bright colors, and rhyming or simple language will not be
much help if your message is obviously nonsensical, or if it contradicts
facts that your audience knows to be true. The psychologists who do these
experiments do not believe that people are stupid or infinitely gullible. What
psychologists do believe is that all of us live much of our life guided by the
impressions of System 1—and we often do not know the source of these
impressions. How do you know that a statement is true? If it is strongly
linked by logic or association to other beliefs or preferences you hold, or
comes from a source you trust and like, you will feel a sense of cognitive
ease. The trouble is that there may be other causes for your feeling of ease
—including the quality of the font and the appealing rhythm of the prose—
and you have no simple way of tracing your feelings to their source. This is
the message of figure 5: the sense of ease or strain has multiple causes,
and it is difficult to tease them apart. Difficult, but not impossible. People
can overcome some of the superficial factors that produce illusions of truth
when strongly motivated to do so. On most occasions, however, the lazy
System 2 will adopt the suggestions of System 1 and march on.
Strain and Effort
The symmetry of many associative connections was a dominant theme in
the discussion of associative coherence. As we saw earlier, people who
are made to “smile” or “frown” by sticking a pencil in their mouth or holding
a ball between their furrowed brows are prone to experience the emotions
that frowning and smiling normally express. The same self-reinforcing
reciprocity is found in studies of cognitive ease. On the one hand, cognitive
strain is experienced when the effortful operations of System 2 are
engaged. On the other hand, the experience of cognitive strain, whatever
its source, tends to mobilize System 2, shifting people’s approach to
problems from a casual intuitive mode to a more engaged and analytic
mode.
The bat-and-ball problem was mentioned earlier as a test of people’s
tendency to answer questions with the first idea that comes to their mind,
without checking it. Shane Frederick’s Cognitive Reflection Test consists
of the bat-and-ball problem and two others, all chosen because they evoke
an immediate intuitive answer that is incorrect. The other two items in the
CRT are:
If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long
would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
100 minutes OR 5 minutes
In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch
doubles in size.
If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long
would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?
24 days OR 47 days
The correct answers to both problems are in a footnote at the bottom of the
page.* The experimenters recruited 40 Princeton students to take the CRT.
Half of them saw the puzzles in a small font in washed-out gray print. The
puzzles were legible, but the font induced cognitive strain. The results tell a
clear story: 90% of the students who saw the CRT in normal font made at
least one mistake in the test, but the proportion dropped to 35% when the
font was barely legible. You read this correctly: performance was better
with the bad font. Cognitive strain, whatever its source, mobilizes System
2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System
1.
The Pleasure of Cognitive Ease
An article titled “Mind at Ease Puts a Smile on the Face” describes an
experiment in which participants were briefly shown pictures of objects.
Some of these pictures were made easier to recognize by showing the
outline of the object just before the complete image was shown, so briefly
that the contours were never noticed. Emotional reactions were measured
by recording electrical impulses from facial muscles, registering changes
of expression that are too slight and too brief to be detectable by
observers. As expected, people showed a faint smile and relaxed brows
when the pictures were easier to see. It appears to be a feature of System
1 that cognitive ease is associated with good feelings.
As expected, easily pronounced words evoke a favorable attitude.
Companies with pronounceable names dmisorrectlo better than others for
the first week after the stock is issued, though the effect disappears over
time. Stocks with pronounceable trading symbols (like KAR or LUNMOO)
outperform those with tongue-twisting tickers like PXG or RDO—and they
appear to retain a small advantage over some time. A study conducted in
Switzerland found that investors believe that stocks with fluent names like
Emmi, Swissfirst, and Comet will earn higher returns than those with clunky
labels like Geberit and Ypsomed.
As we saw in figure 5, repetition induces cognitive ease and a
comforting feeling of familiarity. The famed psychologist Robert Zajonc
dedicated much of his career to the study of the link between the repetition
of an arbitrary stimulus and the mild affection that people eventually have
for it. Zajonc called it the mere exposure effect. A demonstration
conducted in the student newspapers of the University of Michigan and of
Michigan State University is one of my favorite experiments. For a period
of some weeks, an ad-like box appeared on the front page of the paper,
which contained one of the following Turkish (or Turkish-sounding) words:
kadirga, saricik, biwonjni, nansoma, and iktitaf. The frequency with which
the words were repeated varied: one of the words was shown only once,
the others appeared on two, five, ten, or twenty-five separate occasions.
(The words that were presented most often in one of the university papers
were the least frequent in the other.) No explanation was offered, and
readers’ queries were answered by the statement that “the purchaser of
the display wished for anonymity.”
When the mysterious series of ads ended, the investigators sent
questionnaires to the university communities, asking for impressions of
whether each of the words “means something ‘good’ or something ‘bad.’”
The results were spectacular: the words that were presented more
frequently were rated much more favorably than the words that had been
shown only once or twice. The finding has been confirmed in many
experiments, using Chinese ideographs, faces, and randomly shaped
polygons.
The mere exposure effect does not depend on the conscious
experience of familiarity. In fact, the effect does not depend on
consciousness at all: it occurs even when the repeated words or pictures
are shown so quickly that the observers never become aware of having
seen them. They still end up liking the words or pictures that were
presented more frequently. As should be clear by now, System 1 can
respond to impressions of events of which System 2 is unaware. Indeed,
the mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual
never consciously sees.
Zajonc argued that the effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly
important biological fact, and that it extends to all animals. To survive in a
frequently dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel
stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. Survival prospects are poor for an
animal that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the
initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure
effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a
stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become
a safety signal, and safety is good. Obviously, this argument is not
restricted to humans. To make that point, one of Zajonc’s associates
exposed two sets of fertile chicken eggs to different tones. After they
hatched, the chicks consistently emitted fewer distress calls when exposed
to the tone they had heard while inhabiting the shell.
Zajonc offered an eloquent summary of hing icts program of research:
j
q
y
g
p g
The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism
in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate
environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and
habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the
most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form
the basis for social organization and cohesion—the basic
sources of psychological and social stability.
The link between positive emotion and cognitive ease in System 1 has a
long evolutionary history.
