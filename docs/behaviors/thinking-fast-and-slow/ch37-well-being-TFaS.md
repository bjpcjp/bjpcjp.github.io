Experienced Well-Being
When I became interested in the study of well-being about fifteen years
ago, I quickly found out that almost everything that was known about the
subject drew on the answers of millions of people to minor variations of a
survey question, which was generally accepted as a measure of
happiness. The question is clearly addressed to your remembering self,
which is invited to think about your life:
All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a
whole these days?
Having come to the topic of well-being from the study of the mistaken
memories of colonoscopies and painfully cold hands, I was naturally
suspicious of global satisfaction with life as a valid measure of well-being.
As the remembering self had not proved to be a good witness in my
experiments, I focused on the well-being of the experiencing self. I
proposed that it made sense to say that “Helen was happy in the month of
March” if
she spent most of her time engaged in activities that she would
rather continue than stop, little time in situations she wished to
escape, and—very important because life is short—not too much
time in a neutral state in which she would not care either way.
There are many different experiences we would rather continue than
stop, including both mental and physical pleasures. One of the examples I
had in mind for a situation that Helen would wish to continue is total
absorption in a task, which Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow—a state that
some artists experience in their creative moments and that many other
people achieve when enthralled by a film, a book, or a crossword puzzle:
interruptions are not welcome in any of these situations. I also had
memories of a happy early childhood in which I always cried when my
mother came to tear me away from my toys to take me to the park, and
cried again when she took me away from the swings and the slide. The
resistance to interruption was a sign I had been having a good time, both
with my toys and with the swings.
I proposed to measure Helen’s objective happiness precisely as we
assessed the experience of the two colonoscopy patients, by evaluating a
profile of the well-being she experienced over successive moments of her
life. In this I was following Edgeworth’s hedonimeter method of a century
earlier. In my initial enthusiasm for this approach, I was inclined to dismiss
Helen’s remembering self as an error-prone witness to the actual well-
being of her experiencing self. I suspected this position was too extreme,
which it turned out to be, but it was a good start.

I assembled “a dream team” that included three other psychologists of
different specialties and one economist, and we set out together to
develop a measure of the well-being of the experiencing self. A continuous
record of experience was unfortunately impossible—a person cannot live
normally while constantly reporting her experiences. The closest alternative
was experience sampling, a method that Csikszentmihalyi had invented.
Technology has advanced since its first uses. Experience sampling is now
implemented by programming an individual’s cell phone to beep or vibrate
at random intervals during the day. The phone then presents a brief menu
of questions about what the respondent was doing and who was with her
when she was interrupted. The participant is also shown rating scales to
report the intensity of various feelings: happiness, tension, anger, worry,
engagement, physical pain, and others.
Experience sampling is expensive and burdensome (although less
disturbing than most people initially expect; answering the questions takes
very little time). A more practical alternative was needed, so we developed
a method that we called the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). We hoped
it would approximate the results of experience sampling and provide
additional information about the way people spend their time. Participants
(all women, in the early studies) were invited to a two-hour session. We
first asked them to relive the previous day in detail, breaking it up into
episodes like scenes in a film. Later, they answered menus of questions
about each episode, based on the experience-sampling method. They
selected activities in which they were engaged from a list and indicated the
one to which they paid most attention. They also listed the individuals they
had been with, and rated the intensity of several feelings on separate 0–6
scales (0 = the absence of the feeling; 6 = most intense feeling). Our
method drew on evidence that people who are able to retrieve a past
situation in detail are also able to relive the feelings that accompanied it,
even experiencing their earlier physiological indications of emotion.
We assumed that our participants would fairly accurately recover the
feeling of a prototypical moment of the episode. Several comparisons with
experience sampling confirmed the validity of the DRM. Because the
participants also reported the times at which episodes began and ended,
we were able to compute a duration-weighted measure of their feeling
during the entire waking day. Longer episodes counted more than short
episodes in our summary measure of daily affect. Our questionnaire also
included measures of life satisfaction, which we interpreted as the
satisfaction of the remembering self. We used the DRM to study the
determinants of both emotional well-being and life satisfaction in several
thousand women in the United States, France, and Denmark.
The experience of a moment or an episode is not easily represented by
a single happiness value. There are many variants of positive feelings,
including love, joy, engagement, hope, amusement, and many others.
Negative emotions also come in many varieties, including anger, shame,
depression, and loneliness. Although positive and negative emotions exist
at the same time, it is possible to classify most moments of life as
ultimately positive or negative. We could identify unpleasant episodes by
comparing the ratings of positive and negative adjectives. We called an
episode unpleasant if a negative feeling was assigned a higher rating than
all the positive feelings. We found that American women spent about 19%
of the time in an unpleasant state, somewhat higher than French women
(16%) or Danish women (14%).
We called the percentage Jr">n Qge Jr">of time that an individual
spends in an unpleasant state the U-index. For example, an individual who
spent 4 hours of a 16-hour waking day in an unpleasant state would have a
U-index of 25%. The appeal of the U-index is that it is based not on a
rating scale but on an objective measurement of time. If the U-index for a
population drops from 20% to 18%, you can infer that the total time that the
population spent in emotional discomfort or pain has diminished by a
tenth.
A striking observation was the extent of inequality in the distribution of
emotional pain. About half our participants reported going through an
entire day without experiencing an unpleasant episode. On the other hand,
a significant minority of the population experienced considerable
emotional distress for much of the day. It appears that a small fraction of
the population does most of the suffering—whether because of physical or
mental illness, an unhappy temperament, or the misfortunes and personal
tragedies in their life.
A U-index can also be computed for activities. For example, we can
measure the proportion of time that people spend in a negative emotional
state while commuting, working, or interacting with their parents, spouses,
or children. For 1,000 American women in a Midwestern city, the U-index
was 29% for the morning commute, 27% for work, 24% for child care, 18%
for housework, 12% for socializing, 12% for TV watching, and 5% for sex.
The U-index was higher by about 6% on weekdays than it was on
weekends, mostly because on weekends people spend less time in
activities they dislike and do not suffer the tension and stress associated
with work. The biggest surprise was the emotional experience of the time
spent with one’s children, which for American women was slightly less
enjoyable than doing housework. Here we found one of the few contrasts
between French and American women: Frenchwomen spend less time
with their children but enjoy it more, perhaps because they have more
access to child care and spend less of the afternoon driving children to
various activities.
An individual’s mood at any moment depends on her temperament and
overall happiness, but emotional well-being also fluctuates considerably
over the day and the week. The mood of the moment depends primarily on
the current situation. Mood at work, for example, is largely unaffected by
the factors that influence general job satisfaction, including benefits and
status. More important are situational factors such as an opportunity to
socialize with coworkers, exposure to loud noise, time pressure (a
significant source of negative affect), and the immediate presence of a
boss (in our first study, the only thing that was worse than being alone).
Attention is key. Our emotional state is largely determined by what we
attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and
immediate environment. There are exceptions, where the quality of
subjective experience is dominated by recurrent thoughts rather than by the
events of the moment. When happily in love, we may feel joy even when
caught in traffic, and if grieving, we may remain depressed when watching
a funny movie. In normal circumstances, however, we draw pleasure and
pain from what is happening at the moment, if we attend to it. To get
pleasure from eating, for example, you must notice that you are doing it.
We found that French and American women spent about the same amount
of time eating, but for Frenchwomen, eating was twice as likely to be focal
as it was for American women. The Americans were far more prone to
combine eating with other activities, and their pleasure from eating was
correspondingly diluted.
These observations have implications for both individuals and society.
The use of time is one of the areas of life over which people have some
control. Few individuals can will themselves to ha Jr">n Q ha Jr">ve a
sunnier disposition, but some may be able to arrange their lives to spend
less of their day commuting, and more time doing things they enjoy with
people they like. The feelings associated with different activities suggest
that another way to improve experience is to switch time from passive
leisure, such as TV watching, to more active forms of leisure, including
socializing and exercise. From the social perspective, improved
transportation for the labor force, availability of child care for working
women, and improved socializing opportunities for the elderly may be
relatively efficient ways to reduce the U-index of society—even a reduction
by 1% would be a significant achievement, amounting to millions of hours
of avoided suffering. Combined national surveys of time use and of
experienced well-being can inform social policy in multiple ways. The
economist on our team, Alan Krueger, took the lead in an effort to
introduce elements of this method into national statistics.
Measures of experienced well-being are now routinely used in large-scale
national surveys in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and the Gallup
World Poll has extended these measurements to millions of respondents in
the United States and in more than 150 countries. The polls elicit reports of
the emotions experienced during the previous day, though in less detail
than the DRM. The gigantic samples allow extremely fine analyses, which
have confirmed the importance of situational factors, physical health, and
social contact in experienced well-being. Not surprisingly, a headache will
make a person miserable, and the second best predictor of the feelings of
a day is whether a person did or did not have contacts with friends or
relatives. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that happiness is the
experience of spending time with people you love and who love you.
The Gallup data permit a comparison of two aspects of well-being:
 
the well-being that people experience as they live their lives
the judgment they make when they evaluate their life
Gallup’s life evaluation is measured by a question known as the Cantril
Self-Anchoring Striving Scale:
Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the
bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best
possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the
worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you
say you personally feel you stand at this time?
Some aspects of life have more effect on the evaluation of one’s life than
on the experience of living. Educational attainment is an example. More
education is associated with higher evaluation of one’s life, but not with
greater experienced well-being. Indeed, at least in the United States, the
more educated tend to report higher stress. On the other hand, ill health
has a much stronger adverse effect on experienced well-being than on life
evaluation. Living with children also imposes a significant cost in the
currency of daily feelings—reports of stress and anger are common
among parents, but the adverse effects on life evaluation are smaller.
Religious participation also has relatively greater favorable impact on both
positive affect and stress reduction than on life evaluation. Surprisingly,
however, religion provides no reduction of feelings of depression or worry.
An analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways
Well-Bei Jr">n QBei Jr">ng Index, a daily survey of 1,000 Americans,
provides a surprisingly definite answer to the most frequently asked
question in well-being research: Can money buy happiness? The
conclusion is that being poor makes one miserable, and that being rich
may enhance one’s life satisfaction, but does not (on average) improve
experienced well-being.
Severe poverty amplifies the experienced effects of other misfortunes of
life. In particular, illness is much worse for the very poor than for those who
are more comfortable. A headache increases the proportion reporting
sadness and worry from 19% to 38% for individuals in the top two-thirds of
the income distribution. The corresponding numbers for the poorest tenth
are 38% and 70%—a higher baseline level and a much larger increase.
Significant differences between the very poor and others are also found for
the effects of divorce and loneliness. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of
the weekend on experienced well-being are significantly smaller for the
very poor than for most everyone else.
The satiation level beyond which experienced well-being no longer
increases was a household income of about $75,000 in high-cost areas (it
could be less in areas where the cost of living is lower). The average
increase of experienced well-being associated with incomes beyond that
level was precisely zero. This is surprising because higher income
undoubtedly permits the purchase of many pleasures, including vacations
in interesting places and opera tickets, as well as an improved living
environment. Why do these added pleasures not show up in reports of
emotional experience? A plausible interpretation is that higher income is
associated with a reduced ability to enjoy the small pleasures of life. There
is suggestive evidence in favor of this idea: priming students with the idea
of wealth reduces the pleasure their face expresses as they eat a bar of
chocolate!
There is a clear contrast between the effects of income on experienced
well-being and on life satisfaction. Higher income brings with it higher
satisfaction, well beyond the point at which it ceases to have any positive
effect on experience. The general conclusion is as clear for well-being as it
was for colonoscopies: people’s evaluations of their lives and their actual
experience may be related, but they are also different. Life satisfaction is
not a flawed measure of their experienced well-being, as I thought some
years ago. It is something else entirely.
Speaking of Experienced Well-Being
“The objective of policy should be to reduce human suffering. We
aim for a lower U-index in society. Dealing with depression and
extreme poverty should be a priority.”
“The easiest way to increase happiness is to control your use of
time. Can you find more time to do the things you enjoy doing?”
“Beyond the satiation level of income, you can buy more
pleasurable experiences, but you will lose some of your ability to
enjoy the less expensive ones.”
