The Law of Small Numbers
A study of the incidence of kidney cancer in the 3,141 counties of the
United a>< HЉStates reveals a remarkable pattern. The counties in which
the incidence of kidney cancer is lowest are mostly rural, sparsely
populated, and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest,
the South, and the West. What do you make of this?
Your mind has been very active in the last few seconds, and it was
mainly a System 2 operation. You deliberately searched memory and
formulated hypotheses. Some effort was involved; your pupils dilated, and
your heart rate increased measurably. But System 1 was not idle: the
operation of System 2 depended on the facts and suggestions retrieved
from associative memory. You probably rejected the idea that Republican
politics provide protection against kidney cancer. Very likely, you ended up
focusing on the fact that the counties with low incidence of cancer are
mostly rural. The witty statisticians Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling,
from whom I learned this example, commented, “It is both easy and
tempting to infer that their low cancer rates are directly due to the clean
living of the rural lifestyle—no air pollution, no water pollution, access to
fresh food without additives.” This makes perfect sense.
Now consider the counties in which the incidence of kidney cancer is
highest. These ailing counties tend to be mostly rural, sparsely populated,
and located in traditionally Republican states in the Midwest, the South,
and the West. Tongue-in-cheek, Wainer and Zwerling comment: “It is easy
to infer that their high cancer rates might be directly due to the poverty of
the rural lifestyle—no access to good medical care, a high-fat diet, and too
much alcohol, too much tobacco.” Something is wrong, of course. The rural
lifestyle cannot explain both very high and very low incidence of kidney
cancer.
The key factor is not that the counties were rural or predominantly
Republican. It is that rural counties have small populations. And the main
lesson to be learned is not about epidemiology, it is about the difficult
relationship between our mind and statistics. System 1 is highly adept in
one form of thinking—it automatically and effortlessly identifies causal
connections between events, sometimes even when the connection is
spurious. When told about the high-incidence counties, you immediately
assumed that these counties are different from other counties for a reason,
that there must be a cause that explains this difference. As we shall see,
however, System 1 is inept when faced with “merely statistical” facts, which
change the probability of outcomes but do not cause them to happen.
A random event, by definition, does not lend itself to explanation, but
collections of random events do behave in a highly regular fashion.
Imagine a large urn filled with marbles. Half the marbles are red, half are
white. Next, imagine a very patient person (or a robot) who blindly draws 4
marbles from the urn, records the number of red balls in the sample, throws
the balls back into the urn, and then does it all again, many times. If you
summarize the results, you will find that the outcome “2 red, 2 white” occurs
(almost exactly) 6 times as often as the outcome “4 red” or “4 white.” This
relationship is a mathematical fact. You can predict the outcome of
repeated sampling from an urn just as confidently as you can predict what
will happen if you hit an egg with a hammer. You cannot predict every detail
of how the shell will shatter, but you can be sure of the general idea. There
is a difference: the satisfying sense of causation that you experience when
thinking of a hammer hitting an egg is altogether absent when you think
about sampling.
A related statistical fact is relevant to the cancer example. From the
same urn, two very patient marble counters thatрy dake turns. Jack draws
4 marbles on each trial, Jill draws 7. They both record each time they
observe a homogeneous sample—all white or all red. If they go on long
enough, Jack will observe such extreme outcomes more often than Jill—by
a factor of 8 (the expected percentages are 12.5% and 1.56%). Again, no
hammer, no causation, but a mathematical fact: samples of 4 marbles
yield extreme results more often than samples of 7 marbles do.
Now imagine the population of the United States as marbles in a giant
urn. Some marbles are marked KC, for kidney cancer. You draw samples
of marbles and populate each county in turn. Rural samples are smaller
than other samples. Just as in the game of Jack and Jill, extreme
outcomes (very high and/or very low cancer rates) are most likely to be
found in sparsely populated counties. This is all there is to the story.
We started from a fact that calls for a cause: the incidence of kidney
cancer varies widely across counties and the differences are systematic.
The explanation I offered is statistical: extreme outcomes (both high and
low) are more likely to be found in small than in large samples. This
explanation is not causal. The small population of a county neither causes
nor prevents cancer; it merely allows the incidence of cancer to be much
higher (or much lower) than it is in the larger population. The deeper truth is
that there is nothing to explain. The incidence of cancer is not truly lower or
higher than normal in a county with a small population, it just appears to be
so in a particular year because of an accident of sampling. If we repeat the
analysis next year, we will observe the same general pattern of extreme
results in the small samples, but the counties where cancer was common
last year will not necessarily have a high incidence this year. If this is the
case, the differences between dense and rural counties do not really count
as facts: they are what scientists call artifacts, observations that are
produced entirely by some aspect of the method of research—in this case,
by differences in sample size.
The story I have told may have surprised you, but it was not a revelation.
You have long known that the results of large samples deserve more trust
than smaller samples, and even people who are innocent of statistical
knowledge have heard about this law of large numbers. But “knowing” is
not a yes-no affair and you may find that the following statements apply to
you:
 
The feature “sparsely populated” did not immediately stand out as
relevant when you read the epidemiological story.
You were at least mildly surprised by the size of the difference
between samples of 4 and samples of 7.
Even now, you must exert some mental effort to see that the following
two statements mean exactly the same thing:
Large samples are more precise than small samples.
Small samples yield extreme results more often than large
samples do.
The first statement has a clear ring of truth, but until the second version
makes intuitive sense, you have not truly understood the first.
The bottom line: yes, you did know that the results of large samples are
more precise, but you may now realize that you did not know it very well.
You are not alone. The first study that Amos and I did together showed that
even sophisticated researchers have poor intuitions and a wobbly
understanding of sampling effects.
The Law of Small Numbers
My collaboration with Amos in the early 1970s began with a discussion of
the claim that people who have had no training in statistics are good
“intuitive statisticians.” He told my seminar and me of researchers at the
University of Michigan who were generally optimistic about intuitive
statistics. I had strong feelings about that claim, which I took personally: I
had recently discovered that I was not a good intuitive statistician, and I did
not believe that I was worse than others.
For a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a
nuisance and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every
research project into a gamble. Suppose that you wish to confirm the
hypothesis that the vocabulary of the average six-year-old girl is larger than
the vocabulary of an average boy of the same age. The hypothesis is true
in the population; the average vocabulary of girls is indeed larger. Girls and
boys vary a great deal, however, and by the luck of the draw you could
select a sample in which the difference is inconclusive, or even one in
which boys actually score higher. If you are the researcher, this outcome is
costly to you because you have wasted time and effort, and failed to
confirm a hypothesis that was in fact true. Using a sufficiently large sample
is the only way to reduce the risk. Researchers who pick too small a
sample leave themselves at the mercy of sampling luck.
The risk of error can be estimated for any given sample size by a fairly
simple procedure. Traditionally, however, psychologists do not use
calculations to decide on a sample size. They use their judgment, which is
commonly flawed. An article I had read shortly before the debate with
Amos demonstrated the mistake that researchers made (they still do) by a
dramatic observation. The author pointed out that psychologists commonly
chose samples so small that they exposed themselves to a 50% risk of
failing to confirm their true hypotheses! No researcher in his right mind
would accept such a risk. A plausible explanation was that psychologists’
decisions about sample size reflected prevalent intuitive misconceptions
of the extent of sampling variation.
The article shocked me, because it explained some troubles I had had in
my own research. Like most research psychologists, I had routinely chosen
samples that were too small and had often obtained results that made no
sense. Now I knew why: the odd results were actually artifacts of my
research method. My mistake was particularly embarrassing because I
taught statistics and knew how to compute the sample size that would
reduce the risk of failure to an acceptable level. But I had never chosen a
sample size by computation. Like my colleagues, I had trusted tradition
and my intuition in planning my experiments and had never thought
seriously about the issue. When Amos visited the seminar, I had already
reached the conclusion that my intuitions were deficient, and in the course
of the seminar we quickly agreed that the Michigan optimists were wrong.
Amos and I set out to examine whether I was the only fool or a member
of a majority of fools, by testing whether researchers selected for
mathematical expertise would make similar mistakes. We developed a
questionnaire that described realistic research situations, including
replications of successful experiments. It asked the researchers to choose
sample sizes, to assess the risks of failure to which their decisions
exposed them, and to provide advice to hypothetical graduate students
planning their research. Amos collected the responses of a group of
sophisticated participants (including authors of two statistical textbooks) at
a meetatiрp>
Amos and I called our first joint article “Belief in the Law of Small
Numbers.” We explained, tongue-in-cheek, that “intuitions about random
sampling appear to satisfy the law of small numbers, which asserts that the
law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well.” We also included
a strongly worded recommendation that researchers regard their
“statistical intuitions with proper suspicion and replace impression
formation by computation whenever possible.”
A Bias of Confidence Over Doubt
In a telephone poll of 300 seniors, 60% support the president.
If you had to summarize the message of this sentence in exactly three
words, what would they be? Almost certainly you would choose “elderly
support president.” These words provide the gist of the story. The omitted
details of the poll, that it was done on the phone with a sample of 300, are
of no interest in themselves; they provide background information that
attracts little attention. Your summary would be the same if the sample size
had been different. Of course, a completely absurd number would draw
your attention (“a telephone poll of 6 [or 60 million] elderly voters…”).
Unless you are a professional, however, you may not react very differently
to a sample of 150 and to a sample of 3,000. That is the meaning of the
statement that “people are not adequately sensitive to sample size.”
The message about the poll contains information of two kinds: the story
and the source of the story. Naturally, you focus on the story rather than on
the reliability of the results. When the reliability is obviously low, however,
the message will be discredited. If you are told that “a partisan group has
conducted a flawed and biased poll to show that the elderly support the
president…” you will of course reject the findings of the poll, and they will
not become part of what you believe. Instead, the partisan poll and its false
results will become a new story about political lies. You can choose to
disbelieve a message in such clear-cut cases. But do you discriminate
sufficiently between “I read in The New York Times…” and “I heard at the
watercooler…”? Can your System 1 distinguish degrees of belief? The
principle of WY SIATI suggests that it cannot.
As I described earlier, System 1 is not prone to doubt. It suppresses
ambiguity and spontaneously constructs stories that are as coherent as
possible. Unless the message is immediately negated, the associations
that it evokes will spread as if the message were true. System 2 is capable
of doubt, because it can maintain incompatible possibilities at the same
time. However, sustaining doubt is harder work than sliding into certainty.
The law of small numbers is a manifestation of a general bias that favors
certainty over doubt, which will turn up in many guises in following chapters.
The strong bias toward believing that small samples closely resemble
the population from which they are drawn is also part of a larger story: we
are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see.
The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few
observations is closely related to the halo effect thрhe , the sense we often
get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know
very little. System 1 runs ahead of the facts in constructing a rich image on
the basis of scraps of evidence. A machine for jumping to conclusions will
act as if it believed in the law of small numbers. More generally, it will
produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.
Cause and Chance
The associative machinery seeks causes. The difficulty we have with
statistical regularities is that they call for a different approach. Instead of
focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it
to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be
what it is—chance selected it from among its alternatives.
Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in
evaluating the randomness of truly random events. For an example, take
the sex of six babies born in sequence at a hospital. The sequence of boys
and girls is obviously random; the events are independent of each other,
and the number of boys and girls who were born in the hospital in the last
few hours has no effect whatsoever on the sex of the next baby. Now
consider three possible sequences:
BBBGGG
GGGGGG
BGBBGB
Are the sequences equally likely? The intuitive answer—“of course not!”—
is false. Because the events are independent and because the outcomes
B and G are (approximately) equally likely, then any possible sequence of
six births is as likely as any other. Even now that you know this conclusion
is true, it remains counterintuitive, because only the third sequence
appears random. As expected, BGBBGB is judged much more likely than
the other two sequences. We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent
world, in which regularities (such as a sequence of six girls) appear not by
accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone’s intention.
We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and
when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that
the process is truly random. Random processes produce many sequences
that convince people that the process is not random after all. You can see
why assuming causality could have had evolutionary advantages. It is part
of the general vigilance that we have inherited from ancestors. We are
automatically on the lookout for the possibility that the environment has
changed. Lions may appear on the plain at random times, but it would be
safer to notice and respond to an apparent increase in the rate of
appearance of prides of lions, even if it is actually due to the fluctuations of
a random process.
The widespread misunderstanding of randomness sometimes has
significant consequences. In our article on representativeness, Amos and I
cited the statistician William Feller, who illustrated the ease with which
people see patterns where none exists. During the intensive rocket
bombing of London in World War II, it was generally believed that the
bombing could not be random because a map of the hits revealed
conspicuous gaps. Some suspected that German spies were located in
the unharmed areas. A careful statistical analysis revealed that the
distribution of hits was typical of a random process—and typical as well in
evoking a strong impression that it was not random. “To the untrained eye,”
Feller remarks, “randomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster.”
I soon had an occasion to apply what I had learned frpeaрrainom Feller.
The Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973, and my only significant
contribution to the war effort was to advise high officers in the Israeli Air
Force to stop an investigation. The air war initially went quite badly for
Israel, because of the unexpectedly good performance of Egyptian ground-
to-air missiles. Losses were high, and they appeared to be unevenly
distributed. I was told of two squadrons flying from the same base, one of
which had lost four planes while the other had lost none. An inquiry was
initiated in the hope of learning what it was that the unfortunate squadron
was doing wrong. There was no prior reason to believe that one of the
squadrons was more effective than the other, and no operational
differences were found, but of course the lives of the pilots differed in many
random ways, including, as I recall, how often they went home between
missions and something about the conduct of debriefings. My advice was
that the command should accept that the different outcomes were due to
blind luck, and that the interviewing of the pilots should stop. I reasoned
that luck was the most likely answer, that a random search for a
nonobvious cause was hopeless, and that in the meantime the pilots in the
squadron that had sustained losses did not need the extra burden of being
made to feel that they and their dead friends were at fault.
Some years later, Amos and his students Tom Gilovich and Robert
Vallone caused a stir with their study of misperceptions of randomness in
basketball. The “fact” that players occasionally acquire a hot hand is
generally accepted by players, coaches, and fans. The inference is
irresistible: a player sinks three or four baskets in a row and you cannot
help forming the causal judgment that this player is now hot, with a
temporarily increased propensity to score. Players on both teams adapt to
this judgment—teammates are more likely to pass to the hot scorer and
the defense is more likely to doubleteam. Analysis of thousands of
sequences of shots led to a disappointing conclusion: there is no such
thing as a hot hand in professional basketball, either in shooting from the
field or scoring from the foul line. Of course, some players are more
accurate than others, but the sequence of successes and missed shots
satisfies all tests of randomness. The hot hand is entirely in the eye of the
beholders, who are consistently too quick to perceiv
