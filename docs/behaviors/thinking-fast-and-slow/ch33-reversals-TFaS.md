Reversals
You have the task of setting compensation for victims of violent
crimes. You consider the case of a man who lost the use of his
right arm as a result of a gunshot wound. He was shot when he
walked in on a robbery occurring in a convenience store in his
neighborhood.
Two stores were located near the victim’s home, one of which he
frequented more regularly than the other. Consider two scenarios:
(i) The burglary happened in the man’s regular store.
(ii) The man’s regular store was closed for a funeral, so he did his
shopping in the other store, where he was shot.
Should the store in which the man was shot make a difference to
his compensation?
You made your judgment in joint evaluation, where you consider two
scenarios at the same time and make a comparison. You can apply a rule.
If you think that the second scenario deserves higher compensation, you
should assign it a higher dollar value.
There is almost universal agreement on the answer: compensation
should be the same in both situations. The compensation is for the
crippling injury, so why should the location in which it occurred make any
diff Cmakerence? The joint evaluation of the two scenarios gave you a
chance to examine your moral principles about the factors that are relevant
to victim compensation. For most people, location is not one of these
factors. As in other situations that require an explicit comparison, thinking
was slow and System 2 was involved.
The psychologists Dale Miller and Cathy McFarland, who originally
designed the two scenarios, presented them to different people for single
evaluation. In their between-subjects experiment, each participant saw only
one scenario and assigned a dollar value to it. They found, as you surely
guessed, that the victim was awarded a much larger sum if he was shot in
a store he rarely visited than if he was shot in his regular store. Poignancy
(a close cousin of regret) is a counterfactual feeling, which is evoked
because the thought “if only he had shopped at his regular store…” comes
readily to mind. The familiar System 1 mechanisms of substitution and
intensity matching translate the strength of the emotional reaction to the
story onto a monetary scale, creating a large difference in dollar awards.
The comparison of the two experiments reveals a sharp contrast. Almost
everyone who sees both scenarios together (within-subject) endorses the
principle that poignancy is not a legitimate consideration. Unfortunately, the
principle becomes relevant only when the two scenarios are seen together,
and this is not how life usually works. We normally experience life in the
between-subjects mode, in which contrasting alternatives that might
change your mind are absent, and of course WYSIATI. As a consequence,
the beliefs that you endorse when you reflect about morality do not
necessarily govern your emotional reactions, and the moral intuitions that
come to your mind in different situations are not internally consistent.
The discrepancy between single and joint evaluation of the burglary
scenario belongs to a broad family of reversals of judgment and choice.
The first preference reversals were discovered in the early 1970s, and
many reversals of other kinds were reported over the years.
Challenging Economics
Preference reversals have an important place in the history of the
conversation between psychologists and economists. The reversals that
attracted attention were reported by Sarah Lichtenstein and Paul Slovic,
two psychologists who had done their graduate work at the University of
Michigan at the same time as Amos. They conducted an experiment on
preferences between bets, which I show in a slightly simplified version.
You are offered a choice between two bets, which are to be
played on a roulette wheel with 36 sectors.
Bet A: 11/36 to win $160, 25/36 to lose $15
Bet B: 35/36 to win $40, 1/36 to lose $10
You are asked to choose between a safe bet and a riskier one: an almost
certain win of a modest amount, or a small chance to win a substantially
larger amount and a high probability of losing. Safety prevails, and B is
clearly the more popular choice.
Now consider each bet separately: If you owned that bet, what is the
lowest price at which you would sell it? Remember that you are not
negotiating with anyone—your task is to determine the lowest price at
which you would truly be willing to give up the bet. Try it. You may find that
the prize that can be won is Bmaktweare notsalient in this task, and that
your evaluation of what the bet is worth is anchored on that value. The
results support this conjecture, and the selling price is higher for bet A than
for bet B. This is a preference reversal: people choose B over A, but if they
imagine owning only one of them, they set a higher value on A than on B.
As in the burglary scenarios, the preference reversal occurs because joint
evaluation focuses attention on an aspect of the situation—the fact that bet
A is much less safe than bet B—which was less salient in single
evaluation. The features that caused the difference between the judgments
of the options in single evaluation—the poignancy of the victim being in the
wrong grocery store and the anchoring on the prize—are suppressed or
irrelevant when the options are evaluated jointly. The emotional reactions
of System 1 are much more likely to determine single evaluation; the
comparison that occurs in joint evaluation always involves a more careful
and effortful assessment, which calls for System 2.
The preference reversal can be confirmed in a within-subject
experiment, in which subjects set prices on both sets as part of a long list,
and also choose between them. Participants are unaware of the
inconsistency, and their reactions when confronted with it can be
entertaining. A 1968 interview of a participant in the experiment,
conducted by Sarah Lichtenstein, is an enduring classic of the field. The
experimenter talks at length with a bewildered participant, who chooses
one bet over another but is then willing to pay money to exchange the item
he just chose for the one he just rejected, and goes through the cycle
repeatedly.
Rational Econs would surely not be susceptible to preference reversals,
and the phenomenon was therefore a challenge to the rational-agent
model and to the economic theory that is built on this model. The challenge
could have been ignored, but it was not. A few years after the preference
reversals were reported, two respected economists, David Grether and
Charles Plott, published an article in the prestigious American Economic
Review, in which they reported their own studies of the phenomenon that
Lichtenstein and Slovic had described. This was probably the first finding
by experimental psychologists that ever attracted the attention of
economists. The introductory paragraph of Grether and Plott’s article was
unusually dramatic for a scholarly paper, and their intent was clear: “A body
of data and theory has been developing within psychology which should be
of interest to economists. Taken at face value the data are simply
inconsistent with preference theory and have broad implications about
research priorities within economics…. This paper reports the results of a
series of experiments designed to discredit the psychologists’ works as
applied to economics.”
Grether and Plott listed thirteen theories that could explain the original
findings and reported carefully designed experiments that tested these
theories. One of their hypotheses, which—needless to say—psychologists
found patronizing, was that the results were due to the experiment being
carried out by psychologists! Eventually, only one hypothesis was left
standing: the psychologists were right. Grether and Plott acknowledged
that this hypothesis is the least satisfactory from the point of view of
standard preference theory, because “it allows individual choice to depend
on the context in which the choices are made”—a clear violation of the
coherence doctrine.
You might think that this surprising outcome would cause much
anguished soul-searching among economists, as a basic assumption of
their theory had been successfully challenged. But this is not the way things
work in social science, including both psychol Bmak/p>ished soogy and
economics. Theoretical beliefs are robust, and it takes much more than
one embarrassing finding for established theories to be seriously
questioned. In fact, Grether and Plott’s admirably forthright report had little
direct effect on the convictions of economists, probably including Grether
and Plott. It contributed, however, to a greater willingness of the community
of economists to take psychological research seriously and thereby greatly
advanced the conversation across the boundaries of the disciplines.
Categories
“How tall is John?” If John is 5' tall, your answer will depend on his age; he
is very tall if he is 6 years old, very short if he is 16. Your System 1
automatically retrieves the relevant norm, and the meaning of the scale of
tallness is adjusted automatically. You are also able to match intensities
across categories and answer the question, “How expensive is a
restaurant meal that matches John’s height?” Your answer will depend on
John’s age: a much less expensive meal if he is 16 than if he is 6.
But now look at this:
John is 6. He is 5' tall.
Jim is 16. He is 5'1" tall.
In single evaluations, everyone will agree that John is very tall and Jim is
not, because they are compared to different norms. If you are asked a
directly comparative question, “Is John as tall as Jim?” you will answer that
he is not. There is no surprise here and little ambiguity. In other situations,
however, the process by which objects and events recruit their own context
of comparison can lead to incoherent choices on serious matters.
You should not form the impression that single and joint evaluations are
always inconsistent, or that judgments are completely chaotic. Our world is
broken into categories for which we have norms, such as six-year-old boys
or tables. Judgments and preferences are coherent within categories but
potentially incoherent when the objects that are evaluated belong to
different categories. For an example, answer the following three questions:
Which do you like more, apples or peaches?
Which do you like more, steak or stew?
Which do you like more, apples or steak?
The first and the second questions refer to items that belong to the same
category, and you know immediately which you like more. Furthermore,
you would have recovered the same ranking from single evaluation (“How
much do you like apples?” and “How much do you like peaches?”)
because apples and peaches both evoke fruit. There will be no preference
reversal because different fruits are compared to the same norm and
implicitly compared to each other in single as well as in joint evaluation. In
contrast to the within-category questions, there is no stable answer for the
comparison of apples and steak. Unlike apples and peaches, apples and
steak are not natural substitutes and they do not fill the same need. You
sometimes want steak and sometimes an apple, but you rarely say that
either one will do just as well as the other.
Imagine receiving an e-mail from an organization that you generally trust,
requesting a Bmak
Dolphins in many breeding locations are threatened by pollution,
which is expected to result in a decline of the dolphin population.
A special fund supported by private contributions has been set up
to provide pollution-free breeding locations for dolphins.
What associations did this question evoke? Whether or not you were fully
aware of them, ideas and memories of related causes came to your mind.
Projects intended to preserve endangered species were especially likely
to be recalled. Evaluation on the GOOD–BAD dimension is an automatic
operation of System 1, and you formed a crude impression of the ranking
of the dolphin among the species that came to mind. The dolphin is much
more charming than, say, ferrets, snails, or carp—it has a highly favorable
rank in the set of species to which it is spontaneously compared.
The question you must answer is not whether you like dolphins more
than carp; you have been asked to come up with a dollar value. Of course,
you may know from the experience of previous solicitations that you never
respond to requests of this kind. For a few minutes, imagine yourself as
someone who does contribute to such appeals.
Like many other difficult questions, the assessment of dollar value can
be solved by substitution and intensity matching. The dollar question is
difficult, but an easier question is readily available. Because you like
dolphins, you will probably feel that saving them is a good cause. The next
step, which is also automatic, generates a dollar number by translating the
intensity of your liking of dolphins onto a scale of contributions. You have a
sense of your scale of previous contributions to environmental causes,
which may differ from the scale of your contributions to politics or to the
football team of your alma mater. You know what amount would be a “very
large” contribution for you and what amounts are “large,” “modest,” and
“small.” You also have scales for your attitude to species (from “like very
much” to “not at all”). You are therefore able to translate your attitude onto
the dollar scale, moving automatically from “like a lot” to “fairly large
contribution” and from there to a number of dollars.
On another occasion, you are approached with a different appeal:
Farmworkers, who are exposed to the sun for many hours, have a
higher rate of skin cancer than the general population. Frequent
medical check-ups can reduce the risk. A fund will be set up to
support medical check-ups for threatened groups.
Is this an urgent problem? Which category did it evoke as a norm when you
assessed urgency? If you automatically categorized the problem as a
public-health issue, you probably found that the threat of skin cancer in
farmworkers does not rank very high among these issues—almost
certainly lower than the rank of dolphins among endangered species. As
you translated your impression of the relative importance of the skin cancer
issue into a dollar amount, you might well have come up with a smaller
contribution than you offered to protect an endearing animal. In
experiments, the dolphins attracted somewhat larger contributions in single
evaluation than did the farmworkers.
Next, consider the two causes in joint evaluation. Which of the two,
dolphins or farmworkers, deserves a larger dollar contribution? Joint
evaluation highlights a feature that was not noticeable in si Bmakecksider
the ngle evaluation but is recognized as decisive when detected: farmers
are human, dolphins are not. You knew that, of course, but it was not
relevant to the judgment that you made in single evaluation. The fact that
dolphins are not human did not arise because all the issues that were
activated in your memory shared that feature. The fact that farmworkers
are human did not come to mind because all public-health issues involve
humans. The narrow framing of single evaluation allowed dolphins to have
a higher intensity score, leading to a high rate of contributions by intensity
matching. Joint evaluation changes the representation of the issues: the
“human vs. animal” feature becomes salient only when the two are seen
together. In joint evaluation people show a solid preference for the
farmworkers and a willingness to contribute substantially more to their
welfare than to the protection of a likable non-human species. Here again,
as in the cases of the bets and the burglary shooting, the judgments made
in single and in joint evaluation will not be consistent.
Christopher Hsee, of the University of Chicago, has contributed the
following example of preference reversal, among many others of the same
type. The objects to be evaluated are secondhand music dictionaries.
Dictionary A Dictionary B
Year of publication 1993
1993
Number of entries 10,000
20,000
Condition
Like new
Cover torn, otherwise like new
When the dictionaries are presented in single evaluation, dictionary A is
valued more highly, but of course the preference changes in joint
evaluation. The result illustrates Hsee’s evaluability hypothesis: The
number of entries is given no weight in single evaluation, because the
numbers are not “evaluable” on their own. In joint evaluation, in contrast, it
is immediately obvious that dictionary B is superior on this attribute, and it
is also apparent that the number of entries is far more important than the
condition of the cover.
Unjust Reversals
There is good reason to believe that the administration of justice is
infected by predictable incoherence in several domains. The evidence is
drawn in part from experiments, including studies of mock juries, and in
part from observation of patterns in legislation, regulation, and litigation.
In one experiment, mock jurors recruited from jury rolls in Texas were
asked to assess punitive damages in several civil cases. The cases came
in pairs, each consisting of one claim for physical injury and one for
financial loss. The mock jurors first assessed one of the scenarios and
then they were shown the case with which it was Bmak in, eac paired and
were asked to compare the two. The following are summaries of one pair
of cases:
Case 1: A child suffered moderate burns when his pajamas
caught fire as he was playing with matches. The firm that
produced the pajamas had not made them adequately fire
resistant.
Case 2: The unscrupulous dealings of a bank caused another
bank a loss of $10 million.
Half of the participants judged case 1 first (in single evaluation) before
comparing the two cases in joint evaluation. The sequence was reversed
for the other participants. In single evaluation, the jurors awarded higher
punitive damages to the defrauded bank than to the burned child,
presumably because the size of the financial loss provided a high anchor.
When the cases were considered together, however, sympathy for the
individual victim prevailed over the anchoring effect and the jurors
increased the award to the child to surpass the award to the bank.
Averaging over several such pairs of cases, awards to victims of personal
injury were more than twice as large in joint than in single evaluation. The
jurors who saw the case of the burned child on its own made an offer that
matched the intensity of their feelings. They could not anticipate that the
award to the child would appear inadequate in the context of a large award
to a financial institution. In joint evaluation, the punitive award to the bank
remained anchored on the loss it had sustained, but the award to the
burned child increased, reflecting the outrage evoked by negligence that
causes injury to a child.
As we have seen, rationality is generally served by broader and more
comprehensive frames, and joint evaluation is obviously broader than
single evaluation. Of course, you should be wary of joint evaluation when
someone who controls what you see has a vested interest in what you
choose. Salespeople quickly learn that manipulation of the context in which
customers see a good can profoundly influence preferences. Except for
such cases of deliberate manipulation, there is a presumption that the
comparative judgment, which necessarily involves System 2, is more likely
to be stable than single evaluations, which often reflect the intensity of
emotional responses of System 1. We would expect that any institution that
wishes to elicit thoughtful judgments would seek to provide the judges with
a broad context for the assessments of individual cases. I was surprised to
learn from Cass Sunstein that jurors who are to assess punitive damages
are explicitly prohibited from considering other cases. The legal system,
contrary to psychological common sense, favors single evaluation.
In another study of incoherence in the legal system, Sunstein com
