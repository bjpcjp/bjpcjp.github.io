The Associative Machine
To begin your exploration of the surprising workings of System 1, look at
the following words:
Bananas Vomit
A lot happened to you during the last second or two. You experienced
some unpleasant images and memories. Your face twisted slightly in an
expression of disgust, and you may have pushed this book imperceptibly
farther away. Your heart rate increased, the hair on your arms rose a little,
and your sweat glands were activated. In short, you responded to the
disgusting word with an attenuated version of how you would react to the
actual event. All of this was completely automatic, beyond your control.
There was no particular reason to do so, but your mind automatically
assumed a temporal sequence and a causal connection between the
words bananas and vomit, forming a sketchy scenario in which bananas
caused the sickness. As a result, you are experiencing a temporary
aversion to bananas (don’t worry, it will pass). The state of your memory
has changed in other ways: you are now unusually ready to recognize and
respond to objects and concepts associated with “vomit,” such as sick,
stink, or nausea, and words associated with “bananas,” such as yellow and
fruit, and perhaps apple and berries.
Vomiting normally occurs in specific contexts, such as hangovers and
indigestion. You would also be unusually ready to recognize words
associated with other causes of the same unfortunate outcome.
Furthermore, your System 1 noticed the fact that the juxtaposition of the
two words is uncommon; you probably never encountered it before. You
experienced mild surprise.
This complex constellation of responses occurred quickly, automatically,
and effortlessly. You did not will it and you could not stop it. It was an
operation of System 1. The events that took place as a result of your
seeing the words happened by a process called associative activation:
ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading
cascade of activity in your brain. The essential feature of this complex set
of mental events is its coherence. Each element is connected, and each
supports and strengthens the others. The word evokes memories, which
evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions and other
reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency. The
facial expression and the avoidance motion intensify the feelings to which
they are linked, and the feelings in turn reinforce compatible ideas. All this
happens quickly and all at once, yielding a self-reinforcing pattern of
cognitive, emotional, and physical responses that is both diverse and
integrated—it has been called associatively coherent.
In a second or so you accomplished, automatically and unconsciously, a
remarkable feat. Starting from a completely unexpected event, your
System 1 made as much sense as possible of the situation—two simple
words, oddly juxtaposed—by linking the words in a causal story; it
evaluated the possible threat (mild to moderate) and created a context for
future developments by preparing you for events that had just become
more likely; it also created a context for the current event by evaluating how
surprising it was. You ended up as informed about the past and as
prepared for the future as you could be.
An odd feature of what happened is that your System 1 treated the mere
conjunction of two words as representations of reality. Your body reacted in
an attenuated replica of a reaction to the real thing, and the emotional
response and physical recoil were part of the interpretation of the event. As
cognitive scientists have emphasized in recent years, cognition is
embodied; you think with your body, not only with your brain.
The mechanism that causes these mental events has been known for a
long time: it is the ass12;velyociation of ideas. We all understand from
experience that ideas follow each other in our conscious mind in a fairly
orderly way. The British philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries searched for the rules that explain such sequences. In An
Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1748, the
Scottish philosopher David Hume reduced the principles of association to
three: resemblance, contiguity in time and place, and causality. Our
concept of association has changed radically since Hume’s days, but his
three principles still provide a good start.
I will adopt an expansive view of what an idea is. It can be concrete or
abstract, and it can be expressed in many ways: as a verb, as a noun, as
an adjective, or as a clenched fist. Psychologists think of ideas as nodes in
a vast network, called associative memory, in which each idea is linked to
many others. There are different types of links: causes are linked to their
effects (virus 
 cold); things to their properties (lime 
 green); things to
the categories to which they belong (banana 
 fruit). One way we have
advanced beyond Hume is that we no longer think of the mind as going
through a sequence of conscious ideas, one at a time. In the current view
of how associative memory works, a great deal happens at once. An idea
that has been activated does not merely evoke one other idea. It activates
many ideas, which in turn activate others. Furthermore, only a few of the
activated ideas will register in consciousness; most of the work of
associative thinking is silent, hidden from our conscious selves. The notion
that we have limited access to the workings of our minds is difficult to
accept because, naturally, it is alien to our experience, but it is true: you
know far less about yourself than you feel you do.
The Marvels of Priming
As is common in science, the first big breakthrough in our understanding of
the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of
measurement. Until a few decades ago, the only way to study associations
was to ask many people questions such as, “What is the first word that
comes to your mind when you hear the word DAY?” The researchers tallied
the frequency of responses, such as “night,” “sunny,” or “long.” In the 1980s,
psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and
measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be
evoked. If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are
temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP
than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen
WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes
the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.
Priming effects take many forms. If the idea of EAT is currently on your
mind (whether or not you are conscious of it), you will be quicker than usual
to recognize the word SOUP when it is spoken in a whisper or presented
in a blurry font. And of course you are primed not only for the idea of soup
but also for a multitude of food-related ideas, including fork, hungry, fat,
diet, and cookie. If for your most recent meal you sat at a wobbly restaurant
table, you will be primed for wobbly as well. Furthermore, the primed ideas
have some ability to prime other ideas, although more weakly. Like ripples
on a pond, activation spreads through a small part of the vast network of
associated ideas. The mapping of these ripples is now one of the most
exciting pursuits in psychological research.
Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the
discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot
know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the
alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of
which you are not even aware. In an experiment that became an instant
classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students
at New York University—most aged eighteen to twenty-two—to assemble
four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it
yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences
contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful,
bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young
participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the
hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers
unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the
corridor to the other. As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had
fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the
hallway significantly more slowly than the others.
The “Florida effect” involves two stages of priming. First, the set of
words primes thoughts of old age, though the word old is never mentioned;
second, these thoughts prime a behavior, walking slowly, which is
associated with old age. All this happens without any awareness. When
they were questioned afterward, none of the students reported noticing that
the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they
did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words they
had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious
awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless. This remarkable
priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known
as the ideomotor effect. Although you surely were not aware of it, reading
this paragraph primed you as well. If you had needed to stand up to get a
glass of water, you would have been slightly slower than usual to rise from
your chair—unless you happen to dislike the elderly, in which case
research suggests that you might have been slightly faster than usual!
The ideomotor link also works in reverse. A study conducted in a
German university was the mirror image of the early experiment that Bargh
and his colleagues had carried out in New York. Students were asked to
walk around a room for 5 minutes at a rate of 30 steps per minute, which
was about one-third their normal pace. After this brief experience, the
participants were much quicker to recognize words related to old age,
such as forgetful, old, and lonely. Reciprocal priming effects tend to
produce a coherent reaction: if you were primed to think of old age, you
would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.
Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. For example,
being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you
feel amused. Go ahead and take a pencil, and hold it between your teeth
for a few seconds with the eraser pointing to your right and the point to your
left. Now hold the pencil so the point is aimed straight in front of you, by
pursing your lips around the eraser end. You were probably unaware that
one of these actions forced your face into a frown and the other into a
smile. College students were asked to rate the humor of cartoons from
Gary Larson’s The Far Side while holding a pencil in their mouth. Those
who were “smiling” (without any awareness of doing so) found the cartoons
rri221; (withfunnier than did those who were “frowning.” In another
experiment, people whose face was shaped into a frown (by squeezing
their eyebrows together) reported an enhanced emotional response to
upsetting pictures—starving children, people arguing, maimed accident
victims.
Simple, common gestures can also unconsciously influence our thoughts
and feelings. In one demonstration, people were asked to listen to
messages through new headphones. They were told that the purpose of
the experiment was to test the quality of the audio equipment and were
instructed to move their heads repeatedly to check for any distortions of
sound. Half the participants were told to nod their head up and down while
others were told to shake it side to side. The messages they heard were
radio editorials. Those who nodded (a yes gesture) tended to accept the
message they heard, but those who shook their head tended to reject it.
Again, there was no awareness, just a habitual connection between an
attitude of rejection or acceptance and its common physical expression.
You can see why the common admonition to “act calm and kind regardless
of how you feel” is very good advice: you are likely to be rewarded by
actually feeling calm and kind.
Primes That Guide Us
Studies of priming effects have yielded discoveries that threaten our self-
image as conscious and autonomous authors of our judgments and our
choices. For instance, most of us think of voting as a deliberate act that
reflects our values and our assessments of policies and is not influenced
by irrelevancies. Our vote should not be affected by the location of the
polling station, for example, but it is. A study of voting patterns in precincts
of Arizona in 2000 showed that the support for propositions to increase the
funding of schools was significantly greater when the polling station was in
a school than when it was in a nearby location. A separate experiment
showed that exposing people to images of classrooms and school lockers
also increased the tendency of participants to support a school initiative.
The effect of the images was larger than the difference between parents
and other voters! The study of priming has come some way from the initial
demonstrations that reminding people of old age makes them walk more
slowly. We now know that the effects of priming can reach into every corner
of our lives.
Reminders of money produce some troubling effects. Participants in one
experiment were shown a list of five words from which they were required
to construct a four-word phrase that had a money theme (“high a salary
desk paying” became “a high-paying salary”). Other primes were much
more subtle, including the presence of an irrelevant money-related object
in the background, such as a stack of Monopoly money on a table, or a
computer with a screen saver of dollar bills floating in water.
Money-primed people become more independent than they would be
without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in
trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter
for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed
people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time
helping another student who pretended to be confused about an
experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of
pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their
mind picked up fewer pencils. In another experiment in the series,
participants were told that they would shortly have a get-acquainted
conversation with another person and were asked to set up two chairs
while the experimenter left to retrieve that person. Participants primed by
money chose in the exto stay much farther apart than their nonprimed
peers (118 vs. 80 centimeters). Money-primed undergraduates also
showed a greater preference for being alone.
The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes
individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others,
or to accept demands from others. The psychologist who has done this
remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs, has been laudably restrained in
discussing the implications of her findings, leaving the task to her readers.
Her experiments are profound—her findings suggest that living in a culture
that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and
our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not
be proud. Some cultures provide frequent reminders of respect, others
constantly remind their members of God, and some societies prime
obedience by large images of the Dear Leader. Can there be any doubt
that the ubiquitous portraits of the national leader in dictatorial societies
not only convey the feeling that “Big Brother Is Watching” but also lead to
an actual reduction in spontaneous thought and independent action?
The evidence of priming studies suggests that reminding people of their
mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become
reassuring in the context of the terror of death. Other experiments have
confirmed Freudian insights about the role of symbols and metaphors in
unconscious associations. For example, consider the ambiguous word
fragments W_ _ H and S_ _ P. People who were recently asked to think of
an action of which they are ashamed are more likely to complete those
fragments as WASH and SOAP and less likely to see WISH and SOUP.
Furthermore, merely thinking about stabbing a coworker in the back leaves
people more inclined to buy soap, disinfectant, or detergent than batteries,
juice, or candy bars. Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a
desire to cleanse one’s body, an impulse that has been dubbed the “Lady
Macbeth effect.”
The cleansing is highly specific to the body parts involved in a sin.
Participants in an experiment were induced to “lie” to an imaginary person,
either on the phone or in e-mail. In a subsequent test of the desirability of
various products, people who had lied on the phone preferred mouthwash
over soap, and those who had lied in e-mail preferred soap to mouthwash.
When I describe priming studies to audiences, the reaction is often
disbelief. This is not a surprise: System 2 believes that it is in charge and
that it knows the reasons for its choices. Questions are probably cropping
up in your mind as well: How is it possible for such trivial manipulations of
the context to have such large effects? Do these experiments demonstrate
that we are completely at the mercy of whatever primes the environment
provides at any moment? Of course not. The effects of the primes are
robust but not necessarily large. Among a hundred voters, only a few
whose initial preferences were uncertain will vote differently about a school
issue if their precinct is located in a school rather than in a church—but a
few percent could tip an election.
The idea you should focus on, however, is that disbelief is not an option.
The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no
choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.
More important, you must accept that they are true about you. If you had
been exposed to a screen saver of floating dollar bills, you too would likely
have picked up fewer pencils to help a clumsy stranger. You do not believe
that these results apply to you because they correspond to nothing in your
subjective experience. But your subjective expefteelief. Trience consists
largely of the story that your System 2 tells itself about what is going on.
Priming phenomena arise in System 1, and you have no conscious access
to them.
I conclude with a perfect demonstration of a priming effect, which was
conducted in an office kitchen at a British university. For many years
members of that office had paid for the tea or coffee to which they helped
themselves during the day by dropping money into an “honesty box.” A list
of suggested prices was posted. One day a banner poster was displayed
just above the price list, with no warning or explanation. For a period of ten
weeks a new image was presented each week, either flowers or eyes that
appeared to be looking directly at the observer. No one commented on the
new decorations, but the contributions to the honesty box changed
significantly. The posters and the amounts that people put into the cash
box (relative to the amount they consumed) are shown in figure 4. They
deserve a close look.
Figure 4
On the first week of the experiment (which you can see at the bottom of the
figure), two wide-open eyes stare at the coffee or tea drinkers, whose
average contribution was 70 pence per liter of milk. On week 2, the poster
shows flowers and average contributions drop to about 15 pence. The
trend continues. On average, the users of the kitchen contributed almost
three times as much in “eye weeks” as they did in “flower weeks.”
Evidently, a purely symbolic reminder of being watched prodded people
into improved behavior. As we expect at this p
