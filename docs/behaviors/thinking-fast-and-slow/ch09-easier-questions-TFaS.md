Answering an Easier Question
A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped.
True, you occasionally face a question such as 17 × 24 = ? to which no
answer comes immediately to mind, but these dumbfounded moments are
rare. The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and
opinions about almost everything that comes your way. You like or dislike
people long before you know much about them; you trust or distrust
strangers without knowing why; you feel that an enterprise is bound to
succeed without analyzing it. Whether you state them or not, you often have
answers to questions that you do not completely understand, relying on
evidence that you can neither explain nor defend.
Substituting Questions
I propose a simple account of how we generate intuitive opinions on
complex matters. If a satisfactory answer to a hard question isebr ques D
not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and
will answer it. I call the operation of answering one question in place of
another substitution. I also adopt the following terms:
The target question is the assessment you intend to produce.
The heuristic question is the simpler question that you answer instead.
The technical definition of heuristic is a simple procedure that helps find
adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions. The word
comes from the same root as eureka.
The idea of substitution came up early in my work with Amos, and it was
the core of what became the heuristics and biases approach. We asked
ourselves how people manage to make judgments of probability without
knowing precisely what probability is. We concluded that people must
somehow simplify that impossible task, and we set out to find how they do
it. Our answer was that when called upon to judge probability, people
actually judge something else and believe they have judged probability.
System 1 often makes this move when faced with difficult target questions,
if the answer to a related and easier heuristic question comes readily to
mind.
Substituting one question for another can be a good strategy for solving
difficult problems, and George Pólya included substitution in his classic
How to Solve It: “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier
problem you can solve: find it.” Pólya’s heuristics are strategic procedures
that are deliberately implemented by System 2. But the heuristics that I
discuss in this chapter are not chosen; they are a consequence of the
mental shotgun, the imprecise control we have over targeting our
responses to questions.
Consider the questions listed in the left-hand column of table 1. These
are difficult questions, and before you can produce a reasoned answer to
any of them you must deal with other difficult issues. What is the meaning
of happiness? What are the likely political developments in the next six
months? What are the standard sentences for other financial crimes? How
strong is the competition that the candidate faces? What other
environmental or other causes should be considered? Dealing with these
questions seriously is completely impractical. But you are not limited to
perfectly reasoned answers to questions. There is a heuristic alternative to
careful reasoning, which sometimes works fairly well and sometimes leads
to serious errors.
Target Question
Heuristic Question
How much would you contribute to
save an endangered species?
How much emotion do I feel when
I think of dying dolphins?
How happy are you with your life
these days?
What is my mood right now?
How popular is the president right
now?
How popular will the president be
six months from now?
How should financial advisers who
prey on the elderly be punished?
How much anger do I feel when I
think of financial predators?
This woman is running for the primary.
How far will she go in politics?
Does this woman look like a
political winner?
Table 1
The mental shotgun makes it easy to generate quick answers to difficult
questions without imposing much hard work on your lazy System 2. The
right-hand counterpart of each of the left-hand questions is very likely to be
evoked and very easily answered. Your feelings about dolphins and
financial crooks, your current mood, your impressions of the political skill of
the primary candidate, or the current standing of the president will readily
come to mind. The heuristic questions provide an off-the-shelf answer to
each of the difficult target questions.
Something is still missing from this story: the answers need to be fitted
to the original questions. For example, my feelings about dying dolphins
must be expressed in dollars. Another capability of System 1, intensity
matching, is available to solve that problem. Recall that both feelings and
contribution dollars are intensity scales. I can feel more or less strongly
about dolphins and there is a contribution that matches the intensity of my
feelings. The dollar amount that will come to my mind is the matching
amount. Similar intensity matches are possible for all the questions. For
example, the political skills of a candidate can range from pathetic to
extraordinarily impressive, and the scale of political success can range
from the low of “She will be defeated in the primary” to a high of “She will
someday be president of the United States.”
The automatic processes of the mental shotgun and intensity matching
often make available one or more answers to easy questions that could be
mapped onto the target question. On some occasions, substitution will
occur and a heuristic answer will be endorsed by System 2. Of course,
System 2 has the opportunity to reject this intuitive answer, or to modify it
by incorporating other information. However, a lazy System 2 often follows
the path of least effort and endorses a heuristic answer without much
scrutiny of whether it is truly appropriate. You will not be stumped, you will
not have to work very her р wheard, and you may not even notice that you
did not answer the question you were asked. Furthermore, you may not
realize that the target question was difficult, because an intuitive answer to
it came readily to mind.
The 3-D Heuristic
Have a look at the picture of the three men and answer the question that
follows.
Figure 9
As printed on the page, is the figure on the right larger than the
figure on the left?
The obvious answer comes quickly to mind: the figure on the right is
larger. If you take a ruler to the two figures, however, you will discover that
in fact the figures are exactly the same size. Your impression of their
relative size is dominated by a powerful illusion, which neatly illustrates the
process of substitution.
The corridor in which the figures are seen is drawn in perspective and
appears to go into the depth plane. Your perceptual system automatically
interprets the picture as a three-dimensional scene, not as an image
printed on a flat paper surface. In the 3-D interpretation, the person on the
right is both much farther away and much larger than the person on the left.
For most of us, this impression of 3-D size is overwhelming. Only visual
artists and experienced photographers have developed the skill of seeing
the drawing as an object on the page. For the rest of us, substitution
occurs: the dominant impression of 3-D size dictates the judgment of 2-D
size. The illusion is due to a 3-D heuristic.
What happens here is a true illusion, not a misunderstanding of the
question. You knew that the question was about the size of the figures in
the picture, as printed on the page. If you had been asked to estimate the
size of the figures, we know from experiments that your answer would have
been in inches, not feet. You were not confused about the question, but you
were influenced by the answer to a question that you were not asked: “How
tall are the three people?”
The essential step in the heuristic—the substitution of three-dimensional
for two-dimensional size—occurred automatically. The picture contains
cues that suggest a 3-D interpretation. These cues are irrelevant to the
task at hand—the judgment of size of the figure on the page—and you
should have ignored them, but you could not. The bias associated with the
heuristic is that objects that appear to be more distant also appear to be
larger on the page. As this example illustrates, a judgment that is based on
substitution will inevitably be biased in predictable ways. In this case, it
happens so deep in the perceptual system that you simply cannot help it.
The Mood Heuristic for Happiness
A survey of German students is one of the best examples of substitution.
The survey that the young participants completed included the following
two questions:
How happy are you these days?
How many dates did you have last month?
< stрr to a p height="0%" width="0%">The experimenters were interested
in the correlation between the two answers. Would the students who
reported many dates say that they were happier than those with fewer
dates? Surprisingly, no: the correlation between the answers was about
zero. Evidently, dating was not what came first to the students’ minds when
they were asked to assess their happiness. Another group of students saw
the same two questions, but in reverse order:
How many dates did you have last month?
How happy are you these days?
The results this time were completely different. In this sequence, the
correlation between the number of dates and reported happiness was
about as high as correlations between psychological measures can get.
What happened?
The explanation is straightforward, and it is a good example of
substitution. Dating was apparently not the center of these students’ life (in
the first survey, happiness and dating were uncorrelated), but when they
were asked to think about their romantic life, they certainly had an
emotional reaction. The students who had many dates were reminded of a
happy aspect of their life, while those who had none were reminded of
loneliness and rejection. The emotion aroused by the dating question was
still on everyone’s mind when the query about general happiness came up.
The psychology of what happened is precisely analogous to the
psychology of the size illusion in figure 9. “Happiness these days” is not a
natural or an easy assessment. A good answer requires a fair amount of
thinking. However, the students who had just been asked about their dating
did not need to think hard because they already had in their mind an
answer to a related question: how happy they were with their love life. They
substituted the question to which they had a readymade answer for the
question they were asked.
Here again, as we did for the illusion, we can ask: Are the students
confused? Do they really think that the two questions—the one they were
asked and the one they answer—are synonymous? Of course not. The
students do not temporarily lose their ability to distinguish romantic life
from life as a whole. If asked about the two concepts, they would say they
are different. But they were not asked whether the concepts are different.
They were asked how happy they were, and System 1 has a ready answer.
Dating is not unique. The same pattern is found if a question about the
students’ relations with their parents or about their finances immediately
precedes the question about general happiness. In both cases,
satisfaction in the particular domain dominates happiness reports. Any
emotionally significant question that alters a person’s mood will have the
same effect. WYSIATI. The present state of mind looms very large when
people evaluate their happiness.
The Affect Heuristic
The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where
emotions are involved. The psychologist Paul Slovic has proposed an
affect heuristic in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their
beliefs about the world. Your political preference determines the
arguments that you find compelling. If you like the current health policy, you
believe its benefits are substantial and its costs more manageable than
the costs of alternatives. If you are a hawk in your attitude toward other
nations, you probabltheр"0%y think they are relatively weak and likely to
submit to your country’s will. If you are a dove, you probably think they are
strong and will not be easily coerced. Your emotional attitude to such
things as irradiated food, red meat, nuclear power, tattoos, or motorcycles
drives your beliefs about their benefits and their risks. If you dislike any of
these things, you probably believe that its risks are high and its benefits
negligible.
The primacy of conclusions does not mean that your mind is completely
closed and that your opinions are wholly immune to information and
sensible reasoning. Your beliefs, and even your emotional attitude, may
change (at least a little) when you learn that the risk of an activity you
disliked is smaller than you thought. However, the information about lower
risks will also change your view of the benefits (for the better) even if
nothing was said about benefits in the information you received.
We see here a new side of the “personality” of System 2. Until now I
have mostly described it as a more or less acquiescent monitor, which
allows considerable leeway to System 1. I have also presented System 2
as active in deliberate memory search, complex computations,
comparisons, planning, and choice. In the bat-and-ball problem and in
many other examples of the interplay between the two systems, it
appeared that System 2 is ultimately in charge, with the ability to resist the
suggestions of System 1, slow things down, and impose logical analysis.
Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2. In the context of attitudes,
however, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1
than a critic of those emotions—an endorser rather than an enforcer. Its
search for information and arguments is mostly constrained to information
that is consistent with existing beliefs, not with an intention to examine
them. An active, coherence-seeking System 1 suggests solutions to an
undemanding System 2.
Speaking of Substitution and Heuristics
“Do we still remember the question we are trying to answer? Or
have we substituted an easier one?”
“The question we face is whether this candidate can succeed.
The question we seem to answer is whether she interviews well.
Let’s not substitute.”
“He likes the project, so he thinks its costs are low and its
benefits are high. Nice example of the affect heuristic.”
“We are using last year’s performance as a heuristic to predict
the value of the firm several years from now. Is this heuristic good
enough? What other information do we need?”
The table below contains a list of features and activities that have been
attributed to System 1. Each of the active sentences replaces a statement,
technically more accurate but harder to understand, to the effect that a
mental event occurs automatically and fast. My hope is that the list of traits
will help you develop an intuitive sense of the “personality” of the fictitious
System 1. As happens with other characters you know, you will have
hunches about what System 1 would do under different circumstances, and
most of your hunches will be correct.
