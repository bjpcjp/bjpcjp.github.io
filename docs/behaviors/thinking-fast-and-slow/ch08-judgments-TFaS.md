How Judgments Happen
There is no limit to the number of questions you can answer, whether they
are questions someone else asks or questions you ask yourself. Nor is
there a limit to the number of attributes you can evaluate. You are capable
of counting the number of capital letters on this page, comparing the height
of the windows of your house to the one across the street, and assessing
the political prospects of your senator on a scale from excellent to
disastrous. The questions are addressed to System 2, which will direct
attention and search memory to find the answers. System 2 receives
questions or generates them: in either case it directs attention and
searches memory to find the answers. System 1 operates differently. It
continuously monitors what is going on outside and inside the mind, and
continuously generates assessments of various aspects of the situation
without specific intention and with little or no effort. These basic
assessments play an important role in intuitive judgment, because they are
easily substituted for more difficult questions—this is the essential idea of
the heuristics and biases approach. Two other features of System 1 also
support the substitution of one judgment for another. One is the ability to
translate values across dimensions, which you do in answering a question
that most people find easy: “If Sam were as tall as he is intelligent, how tall
would he be?” Finally, there is the mental shotgun. An intention of System 2
to answer a specific question or evaluate a particular attribute of the
situation automatically triggers other computations, including basic
assessments.
Basic Assessments
System 1 has been shaped by evolution to provide a continuous
assessment of the main problems that an organism must solve to survive:
How are things going? Is there a threat or a major opportunity? Is
everything normal? Should I approach or avoid? The questions are
perhaps less urgent for a human in a city environment than for a gazelle on
the savannah, aalenc and e: How , but we have inherited the neural
mechanisms that evolved to provide ongoing assessments of threat level,
and they have not been turned off. Situations are constantly evaluated as
good or bad, requiring escape or permitting approach. Good mood and
cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and
familiarity.
For a specific example of a basic assessment, consider the ability to
discriminate friend from foe at a glance. This contributes to one’s chances
of survival in a dangerous world, and such a specialized capability has
indeed evolved. Alex Todorov, my colleague at Princeton, has explored the
biological roots of the rapid judgments of how safe it is to interact with a
stranger. He showed that we are endowed with an ability to evaluate, in a
single glance at a stranger’s face, two potentially crucial facts about that
person: how dominant (and therefore potentially threatening) he is, and
how trustworthy he is, whether his intentions are more likely to be friendly or
hostile. The shape of the face provides the cues for assessing dominance:
a “strong” square chin is one such cue. Facial expression (smile or frown)
provides the cues for assessing the stranger’s intentions. The combination
of a square chin with a turned-down mouth may spell trouble. The accuracy
of face reading is far from perfect: round chins are not a reliable indicator
of meekness, and smiles can (to some extent) be faked. Still, even an
imperfect ability to assess strangers confers a survival advantage.
This ancient mechanism is put to a novel use in the modern world: it has
some influence on how people vote. Todorov showed his students pictures
of men’s faces, sometimes for as little as one-tenth of a second, and
asked them to rate the faces on various attributes, including likability and
competence. Observers agreed quite well on those ratings. The faces that
Todorov showed were not a random set: they were the campaign portraits
of politicians competing for elective office. Todorov then compared the
results of the electoral races to the ratings of competence that Princeton
students had made, based on brief exposure to photographs and without
any political context. In about 70% of the races for senator, congressman,
and governor, the election winner was the candidate whose face had
earned a higher rating of competence. This striking result was quickly
confirmed in national elections in Finland, in zoning board elections in
England, and in various electoral contests in Australia, Germany, and
Mexico. Surprisingly (at least to me), ratings of competence were far more
predictive of voting outcomes in Todorov’s study than ratings of likability.
Todorov has found that people judge competence by combining the two
dimensions of strength and trustworthiness. The faces that exude
competence combine a strong chin with a slight confident-appearing
smile. There is no evidence that these facial features actually predict how
well politicians will perform in office. But studies of the brain’s response to
winning and losing candidates show that we are biologically predisposed
to reject candidates who lack the attributes we value—in this research,
losers evoked stronger indications of (negative) emotional response. This
is an example of what I will call a judgment heuristic in the following
chapters. Voters are attempting to form an impression of how good a
candidate will be in office, and they fall back on a simpler assessment that
is made quickly and automatically and is available when System 2 must

make its decision.
Political scientists followed up on Todorov’s initial research by
identifying a category of voters for whom the automatic preferences of
System 1 are particularly likely to play a large role. They found what they
were looking for among politicalr m="5%">Todoly uninformed voters who
watch a great deal of television. As expected, the effect of facial
competence on voting is about three times larger for information-poor and
TV-prone voters than for others who are better informed and watch less
television. Evidently, the relative importance of System 1 in determining
voting choices is not the same for all people. We will encounter other
examples of such individual differences.
System 1 understands language, of course, and understanding depends
on the basic assessments that are routinely carried out as part of the
perception of events and the comprehension of messages. These
assessments include computations of similarity and representativeness,
attributions of causality, and evaluations of the availability of associations
and exemplars. They are performed even in the absence of a specific task
set, although the results are used to meet task demands as they arise.
The list of basic assessments is long, but not every possible attribute is
assessed. For an example, look briefly at figure 7.
A glance provides an immediate impression of many features of the
display. You know that the two towers are equally tall and that they are
more similar to each other than the tower on the left is to the array of blocks
in the middle. However, you do not immediately know that the number of
blocks in the left-hand tower is the same as the number of blocks arrayed
on the floor, and you have no impression of the height of the tower that you
could build from them. To confirm that the numbers are the same, you
would need to count the two sets of blocks and compare the results, an
activity that only System 2 can carry out.
Figure 7
Sets and Prototypes
For another example, consider the question: What is the average length of
the lines in figure 8?
Figure 8
This question is easy and System 1 answers it without prompting.
Experiments have shown that a fraction of a second is sufficient for people
to register the average length of an array of lines with considerable
precision. Furthermore, the accuracy of these judgments is not impaired
when the observer is cognitively busy with a memory task. They do not
necessarily know how to describe the average in inches or centimeters,
but they will be very accurate in adjusting the length of another line to match
the average. System 2 is not needed to form an impression of the norm of
length for an array. System 1 does it, automatically and effortlessly, just as
it registers the color of the lines and the fact that they are not parallel. We
also can form an immediate impression of the number of objects in an
array—precisely if there are four or fewer objects, crudely if there are
more.
Now to another question: What is the total length of the lines in figure 8?
This is a different experience, because System 1 has no suggestions to
offer. The only way you can answer this question is by activating System 2,
which will laboriously estimate the average, estimate or count the lines,
and multiply average length by the number of lines.
estimaight="0%">
The failure of System 1 to compute the total length of a set of lines at a
glance may look obvious to you; you never thought you could do it. It is in
fact an instance of an important limitation of that system. Because System
1 represents categories by a prototype or a set of typical exemplars, it
deals well with averages but poorly with sums. The size of the category, the
number of instances it contains, tends to be ignored in judgments of what I
will call sum-like variables.
Participants in one of the numerous experiments that were prompted by
the litigation following the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill were asked
their willingness to pay for nets to cover oil ponds in which migratory birds
often drown. Different groups of participants stated their willingness to pay
to save 2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds. If saving birds is an economic
good it should be a sum-like variable: saving 200,000 birds should be
worth much more than saving 2,000 birds. In fact, the average contributions
of the three groups were $80, $78, and $88 respectively. The number of
birds made very little difference. What the participants reacted to, in all
three groups, was a prototype—the awful image of a helpless bird
drowning, its feathers soaked in thick oil. The almost complete neglect of
quantity in such emotional contexts has been confirmed many times.
Intensity Matching
Questions about your happiness, the president’s popularity, the proper
punishment of financial evildoers, and the future prospects of a politician
share an important characteristic: they all refer to an underlying dimension
of intensity or amount, which permits the use of the word more: more
happy, more popular, more severe, or more powerful (for a politician). For
example, a candidate’s political future can range from the low of “She will
be defeated in the primary” to a high of “She will someday be president of
the United States.”
Here we encounter a new aptitude of System 1. An underlying scale of
intensity allows matching across diverse dimensions. If crimes were
colors, murder would be a deeper shade of red than theft. If crimes were
expressed as music, mass murder would be played fortissimo while
accumulating unpaid parking tickets would be a faint pianissimo. And of
course you have similar feelings about the intensity of punishments. In
classic experiments, people adjusted the loudness of a sound to the
severity of crimes; other people adjusted loudness to the severity of legal
punishments. If you heard two notes, one for the crime and one for the
punishment, you would feel a sense of injustice if one tone was much
louder than the other.
Consider an example that we will encounter again later:
Julie read fluently when she was four years old.
Now match Julie’s reading prowess as a child to the following intensity
scales:
How tall is a man who is as tall as Julie was precocious?
What do you think of 6 feet? Obviously too little. What about 7 feet?
Probably too much. You are looking for a height that is as remarkable as
the achievement of reading at age four. Fairly remarkable, but not
extraordinary. Reading at fifteen months would be extraordinary, perhaps
like a man who is 7'8".
What level of income in your profession matches Julie’s reading
achievement?
Which crime is as severe as Julie was precocious?
Which graduating GPA in an Ivy League college matches Julie’s
reading?
Not very hard, was it? Furthermore, you can be assured that your matches
will be quite close to those of other people in your cultural milieu. We will
see that when people are asked to predict Julie’s GPA from the
information about the age at which she learned to read, they answer by
translating from one scale to another and pick the matching GPA. And we
will also see why this mode of prediction by matching is statistically wrong
—although it is perfectly natural to System 1, and for most people except
statisticians it is also acceptable to System 2.
The Mental Shotgun
System 1 carries out many computations at any one time. Some of these
are routine assessments that go on continuously. Whenever your eyes are
open, your brain computes a three-dimensional representation of what is in
your field of vision, complete with the shape of objects, their position in
space, and their identity. No intention is needed to trigger this operation or
the continuous monitoring for violated expectations. In contrast to these
routine assessments, other computations are undertaken only when
needed: you do not maintain a continuous evaluation of how happy or
wealthy you are, and even if you are a political addict you do not
continuously assess the president’s prospects. The occasional judgments
are voluntary. They occur only when you intend them to do so.
You do not automatically count the number of syllables of every word you
read, but you can do it if you so choose. However, the control over
intended computations is far from precise: we often compute much more
than we want or need. I call this excess computation the mental shotgun. It
p
g
is impossible to aim at a single point with a shotgun because it shoots
pellets that scatter, and it seems almost equally difficult for System 1 not to
do more than System 2 charges it to do. Two experiments that I read long
ago suggested this image.
Participants in one experiment listened to pairs of words, with the
instruction to press a key as quickly as possible whenever they detected
that the words rhymed. The words rhyme in both these pairs:
VOTE—NOTE
VOTE—GOAT
The difference is obvious to you because you see the two pairs. VOTE and
GOAT rhyme, but they are spelled differently. The participants only heard
the words, but they were also influenced by the spelling. They were
distinctly slower to recognize the words as rhyming if their spelling was
discrepant. Although the instructions required only a comparison of
sounds, the participants also compared their spelling, and the mismatch
on the irrelevant dimension slowed them down. An intention to answer one
question evoked another, which was not only superfluous but actually
detrimental to the main task.
In another study, people listened to a series of sentences, with the
instruction to press one key as quickly as post="lly desible to indicate if the
sentence was literally true, and another key if the sentence was not literally
true. What are the correct responses for the following sentences?
Some roads are snakes.
Some jobs are snakes.
Some jobs are jails.
All three sentences are literally false. However, you probably noticed that
the second sentence is more obviously false than the other two—the
reaction times collected in the experiment confirmed a substantial
difference. The reason for the difference is that the two difficult sentences
can be metaphorically true. Here again, the intention to perform one
computation evoked another. And here again, the correct answer prevailed
in the conflict, but the conflict with the irrelevant answer disrupted
performance. In the next chapter we will see that the combination of a
mental shotgun with intensity matching explains why we have intuitive
judgments about many things that we know little about.
Speaking of Judgment
“Evaluating people as attractive or not is a basic assessment.
You do that automatically whether or not you want to, and it
influences you.”
“There are circuits in the brain that evaluate dominance from the
shape of the face. He looks the part for a leadership role.”
“The punishment won’t feel just unless its intensity matches the
crime. Just like you can match the loudness of a sound to the
brightness of a light.”
“This was a clear instance of a mental shotgun. He was asked
whether he thought the company was financially sound, but he
couldn’t forget that he likes their product.”
