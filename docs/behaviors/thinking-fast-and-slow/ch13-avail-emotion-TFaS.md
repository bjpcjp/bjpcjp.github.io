Availability, Emotion, and Risk
Students of risk were quick to see that the idea of availability was relevant
to their concerns. Even before our work was published, the economist
Howard Kunreuther, who was then in the early stages of a career that he
has devoted to the study of risk and insurance, noticed that availability
effects help explain the pattern of insurance purchase and protective action
after disasters. Victims and near victims are very concerned after a
disaster. After each significant earthquake, Californians are for a while
diligent in purchasing insurance and adopting measures of protection and
mitigation. They tie down their boiler to reduce quake damage, seal their
basement doors against floods, and maintain emergency supplies in good
order. However, the memories of the disaster dim over time, and so do
worry and diligence. The dynamics of memory help explain the recurrent
cycles of disaster, concern, and growing complacency that are familiar to
students of large-scale emergencies.
Kunreuther also observed that protective actions, whether by individuals
or governments, are usually designed to be adequate to the worst disaster
actually experienced. As long ago as pharaonic Egypt, societies have
tracked the high-water mark of rivers that periodically flood—and have
always prepared accordingly, apparently assuming that floods will not rise
higher than the existing high-water mark. Images of a worse disaster do
not come easily to mind.
Availability and Affect
The most influential studies of availability biases were carried out by our
friends in Eugene, where Paul Slovic and his longtime collaborator Sarah
Lichtenstein were joined by our former student Baruch Fischhoff. They
carried out groundbreaking research on public perceptions of risks,
including a survey that has become the standard example of an availability
bias. They asked participants in their survey to siIs th t#consider pairs of
causes of death: diabetes and asthma, or stroke and accidents. For each
pair, the subjects indicated the more frequent cause and estimated the
ratio of the two frequencies. The judgments were compared to health
statistics of the time. Here’s a sample of their findings:
 
Strokes cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents
combined, but 80% of respondents judged accidental death to be
more likely.
Tornadoes were seen as more frequent killers than asthma, although
the latter cause 20 times more deaths.
Death by lightning was judged less likely than death from botulism
even though it is 52 times more frequent.
Death by disease is 18 times as likely as accidental death, but the
two were judged about equally likely.
Death by accidents was judged to be more than 300 times more
likely than death by diabetes, but the true ratio is 1:4.
The lesson is clear: estimates of causes of death are warped by media
coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The
media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are
shaped by it. Editors cannot ignore the public’s demands that certain
topics and viewpoints receive extensive coverage. Unusual events (such
as botulism) attract disproportionate attention and are consequently
perceived as less unusual than they really are. The world in our heads is
not a precise replica of reality; our expectations about the frequency of
events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the
messages to which we are exposed.
The estimates of causes of death are an almost direct representation of
the activation of ideas in associative memory, and are a good example of
substitution. But Slovic and his colleagues were led to a deeper insight:
they saw that the ease with which ideas of various risks come to mind and
the emotional reactions to these risks are inextricably linked. Frightening
thoughts and images occur to us with particular ease, and thoughts of
danger that are fluent and vivid exacerbate fear.
As mentioned earlier, Slovic eventually developed the notion of an affect
heuristic, in which people make judgments and decisions by consulting
their emotions: Do I like it? Do I hate it? How strongly do I feel about it? In
many domains of life, Slovic said, people form opinions and make choices
that directly express their feelings and their basic tendency to approach or
avoid, often without knowing that they are doing so. The affect heuristic is
an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How
do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What
do I think about it?). Slovic and his colleagues related their views to the
work of the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, who had proposed that
people’s emotional evaluations of outcomes, and the bodily states and the
approach and avoidance tendencies associated with them, all play a
central role in guiding decision making. Damasio and his colleagues have
observed that people who do not display the appropriate emotions before
they decide, sometimes because of brain damage, also have an impaired
ability to make good decisions. An inability to be guided by a “healthy fear”
of bad consequences is a disastrous flaw.
In a compelling demonstration of the workings of the affect heuristic,
Slovic’s research team surveyed opinions about various technologies,
including water fluoridation, chemical plants, food preservatives, and cars,
and asked their respondents to list both the benefits >
The best part of the experiment came next. After completing the initial
survey, the respondents read brief passages with arguments in favor of
various technologies. Some were given arguments that focused on the
numerous benefits of a technology; others, arguments that stressed the low
risks. These messages were effective in changing the emotional appeal of
the technologies. The striking finding was that people who had received a
message extolling the benefits of a technology also changed their beliefs
about its risks. Although they had received no relevant evidence, the
technology they now liked more than before was also perceived as less
risky. Similarly, respondents who were told only that the risks of a
technology were mild developed a more favorable view of its benefits. The
implication is clear: as the psychologist Jonathan Haidt said in another
context, “The emotional tail wags the rational dog.” The affect heuristic
simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality. Good
technologies have few costs in the imaginary world we inhabit, bad
technologies have no benefits, and all decisions are easy. In the real world,
of course, we often face painful tradeoffs between benefits and costs.
The Public and the Experts
Paul Slovic probably knows more about the peculiarities of human
judgment of risk than any other individual. His work offers a picture of Mr.
and Ms. Citizen that is far from flattering: guided by emotion rather than by
reason, easily swayed by trivial details, and inadequately sensitive to
differences between low and negligibly low probabilities. Slovic has also
studied experts, who are clearly superior in dealing with numbers and
amounts. Experts show many of the same biases as the rest of us in
attenuated form, but often their judgments and preferences about risks
diverge from those of other people.
Differences between experts and the public are explained in part by
biases in lay judgments, but Slovic draws attention to situations in which
the differences reflect a genuine conflict of values. He points out that
experts often measure risks by the number of lives (or life-years) lost, while
the public draws finer distinctions, for example between “good deaths” and
“bad deaths,” or between random accidental fatalities and deaths that
occur in the course of voluntary activities such as skiing. These legitimate
distinctions are often ignored in statistics that merely count cases. Slovic
argues from such observations that the public has a richer conception of
risks than the experts do. Consequently, he strongly resists the view that
the experts should rule, and that their opinions should be accepted without
question when they conflict with the opinions and wishes of other citizens.
When experts and the public disagree on their priorities, he says, “Each
side muiesst respect the insights and intelligence of the other.”
In his desire to wrest sole control of risk policy from experts, Slovic has
challenged the foundation of their expertise: the idea that risk is objective.
“Risk” does not exist “out there,” independent of our minds and
culture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the
concept of “risk” to help them understand and cope with the
dangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are
real, there is no such thing as “real risk” or “objective risk.”
To illustrate his claim, Slovic lists nine ways of defining the mortality risk
associated with the release of a toxic material into the air, ranging from
“death per million people” to “death per million dollars of product
produced.” His point is that the evaluation of the risk depends on the
choice of a measure—with the obvious possibility that the choice may
have been guided by a preference for one outcome or another. He goes
on to conclude that “defining risk is thus an exercise in power.” You might
not have guessed that one can get to such thorny policy issues from
experimental studies of the psychology of judgment! However, policy is
ultimately about people, what they want and what is best for them. Every
policy question involves assumptions about human nature, in particular
about the choices that people may make and the consequences of their
choices for themselves and for society.
Another scholar and friend whom I greatly admire, Cass Sunstein,
disagrees sharply with Slovic’s stance on the different views of experts and
citizens, and defends the role of experts as a bulwark against “populist”
excesses. Sunstein is one of the foremost legal scholars in the United
States, and shares with other leaders of his profession the attribute of
intellectual fearlessness. He knows he can master any body of knowledge
quickly and thoroughly, and he has mastered many, including both the
psychology of judgment and choice and issues of regulation and risk
policy. His view is that the existing system of regulation in the United
States displays a very poor setting of priorities, which reflects reaction to
public pressures more than careful objective analysis. He starts from the
position that risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks
should be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the
natural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved (or perhaps the
number of life-years saved, which gives more weight to saving the young)
and the dollar cost to the economy. Poor regulation is wasteful of lives and
money, both of which can be measured objectively. Sunstein has not been
persuaded by Slovic’s argument that risk and its measurement is
subjective. Many aspects of risk assessment are debatable, but he has
faith in the objectivity that may be achieved by science, expertise, and
careful deliberation.
Sunstein came to believe that biased reactions to risks are an important
source of erratic and misplaced priorities in public policy. Lawmakers and
regulators may be overly responsive to the irrational concerns of citizens,
both because of political sensitivity and because they are prone to the
same cognitive biases as other citizens.
Sunstein and a collaborator, the jurist Timur Kuran, invented a name for
the mechanism through which biases flow into policy: the availability
cascade. They comment that in the social context, “all heuristics are equal,
but availability is more equal than the others.” They have in mind an expand
Uned notion of the heuristic, in which availability provides a heuristic for
judgments other than frequency. In particular, the importance of an idea is
often judged by the fluency (and emotional charge) with which that idea
comes to mind.
An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may
start from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public
panic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media
story about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which
becomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story
in itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn
produces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped
along deliberately by “availability entrepreneurs,” individuals or
organizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. The
danger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attention-
grabbing headlines. Scientists and others who try to dampen the
increasing fear and revulsion attract little attention, most of it hostile:
anyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of
association with a “heinous cover-up.” The issue becomes politically
important because it is on everyone’s mind, and the response of the
political system is guided by the intensity of public sentiment. The
availability cascade has now reset priorities. Other risks, and other ways
that resources could be applied for the public good, all have faded into the
background.
Kuran and Sunstein focused on two examples that are still controversial:
the Love Canal affair and the so-called Alar scare. In Love Canal, buried
toxic waste was exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing
contamination of the water well beyond standard limits, as well as a foul
smell. The residents of the community were angry and frightened, and one
of them, Lois Gibbs, was particularly active in an attempt to sustain interest
in the problem. The availability cascade unfolded according to the
standard script. At its peak there were daily stories about Love Canal,
scientists attempting to claim that the dangers were overstated were
ignored or shouted down, ABC News aired a program titled The Killing
Ground, and empty baby-size coffins were paraded in front of the
legislature. A large number of residents were relocated at government
expense, and the control of toxic waste became the major environmental
issue of the 1980s. The legislation that mandated the cleanup of toxic
sites, called CERCLA, established a Superfund and is considered a
significant achievement of environmental legislation. It was also expensive,
and some have claimed that the same amount of money could have saved
many more lives if it had been directed to other priorities. Opinions about
what actually happened at Love Canal are still sharply divided, and claims
of actual damage to health appear not to have been substantiated. Kuran
and Sunstein wrote up the Love Canal story almost as a pseudo-event,
while on the other side of the debate, environmentalists still speak of the
“Love Canal disaster.”
Opinions are also divided on the second example Kuran and Sunstein
used to illustrate their concept of an availability cascade, the Alar incident,
known to detractors of environmental concerns as the “Alar scare” of 1989.
Alar is a chemical that was sprayed on apples to regulate their growth and
improve their appearance. The scare began with press stories that the
chemical, when consumed in gigantic doses, caused cancerous tumors in
rats and mice. The stories understandably frightened the public, and those
fears encouraged more media coverage, the basic mechanism of an
availability cascade. The topic dominated the news and produced
dramatic media events such as the testimony of the actress Meryl Streep
before Congress. The apple industry su ofstained large losses as apples
and apple products became objects of fear. Kuran and Sunstein quote a
citizen who called in to ask “whether it was safer to pour apple juice down
the drain or to take it to a toxic waste dump.” The manufacturer withdrew
the product and the FDA banned it. Subsequent research confirmed that
the substance might pose a very small risk as a possible carcinogen, but
the Alar incident was certainly an enormous overreaction to a minor
problem. The net effect of the incident on public health was probably
detrimental because fewer good apples were consumed.
The Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal
with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much
weight—nothing in between. Every parent who has stayed up waiting for a
teenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize the feeling. You
may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but you
cannot help images of disaster from coming to mind. As Slovic has
argued, the amount of concern is not adequately sensitive to the probability
of harm; you are imagining the numerator—the tragic story you saw on the
news—and not thinking about the denominator. Sunstein has coined the
phrase “probability neglect” to describe the pattern. The combination of
probability neglect with the social mechanisms of availability cascades
inevitably leads to gross exaggeration of minor threats, sometimes with
important consequences.
In today’s world, terrorists are the most significant practitioners of the art
of inducing availability cascades. With a few horrible exceptions such as
9/11, the number of casualties from terror attacks is very small relative to
other causes of death. Even in countries that have been targets of
intensive terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties
almost never came close to the number of traffic deaths. The difference is
in the availability of the two risks, the ease and the frequency with which
they come to mind. Gruesome images, endlessly repeated in the media,
cause everyone to be on edge. As I know from experience, it is difficult to
reason oneself into a state of complete calm. Terrorism speaks directly to
System 1.
Where do I come down in the debate between my friends? Availability
cascades are real and they undoubtedly distort priorities in the allocation
of public resources. Cass Sunstein would seek mechanisms that insulate
decision makers from public pressures, letting the allocation of resources
be determined by impartial experts who have a broad view of all risks and
of the resources available to reduce them. Paul Slovic trusts the experts
much less and the public somewhat more than Sunstein does, and he
points out that insulating the experts from the emotions of the public
produces policies that the public will reject—an impossible situation in a
democracy. Both are eminently sensible, and I agree with both.
I share Sunstein’s discomfort with the influence of irrational fears and
availability cascades on public policy in the domain of risk. However, I also
share Slovic’s belief that widespread fears, even if they are unreasonable,
should not be ignored by policy makers. Rational or not, fear is painful and
debilitating, and policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from
fear, not only from real dangers.
Slovic rightly stresses the resistance of the public to the idea of
decisions being made by unelected and unaccountable experts.
Furthermore, availability cascades may have a long-term benefit by calling
attention to classes of risks and by increasing the overall size of the risk-
reduction budget. The Love Canal incident may have caused excessive
resources to be allocated to the management of toxic betwaste, but it also
had a more general effect in raising the priority level of environmental
concerns. Democracy is inevitably messy, in part because the availability
and affect heuristics that guide citizens’ beliefs and attitudes are inevitably
biased, even if they generally point in the right direction. Psychology should
inform the design of risk policies that combine the experts’ knowledge with
the public’s emotions and intuitions.
