The Characters of the Story
To observe your mind in automatic mode, glance at the image below.
Figure 1
Your experience as you look at the woman’s face seamlessly combines
what we normally call seeing and intuitive thinking. As surely and quickly as
you saw that the young woman’s hair is dark, you knew she is angry.
Furthermore, what you saw extended into the future. You sensed that this
woman is about to say some very unkind words, probably in a loud and
strident voice. A premonition of what she was going to do next came to
mind automatically and effortlessly. You did not intend to assess her mood
or to anticipate what she might do, and your reaction to the picture did not
have the feel of something you did. It just happened to you. It was an
instance of fast thinking.
Now look at the following problem:
17 × 24
You knew immediately that this is a multiplication problem, and probably
knew that you could solve it, with paper and pencil, if not without. You also
had some vague intuitive knowledge of the range of possible results. You
would be quick to recognize that both 12,609 and 123 are implausible.
Without spending some time on the problem, however, you would not be
certain that the answer is not 568. A precise solution did not come to mind,
and you felt that you could choose whether or not to engage in the
computation. If you have not done so yet, you should attempt the
multiplication problem now, completing at least part of it.
You experienced slow thinking as you proceeded through a sequence of
steps. You first retrieved from memory the cognitive program for
multiplication that you learned in school, then you implemented it. Carrying
out the computation was a strain. You felt the burden of holding much
material in memory, as you needed to keep track of where you were and of
where you were going, while holding on to the intermediate result. The
process was mental work: deliberate, effortful, and orderly—a prototype of
slow thinking. The computation was not only an event in your mind; your
body was also involved. Your muscles tensed up, your blood pressure
rose, and your heart rate increased. Someone looking closely at your eyes
while you tackled this problem would have seen your pupils dilate. Your
pupils contracted back to normal size as soon as you ended your work—
when you found the answer (which is 408, by the way) or when you gave
up.
Two Systems
Psychologists have been intensely interested for several decades in the
two modagee fi Pn="cees of thinking evoked by the picture of the angry
woman and by the multiplication problem, and have offered many labels for
them. I adopt terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith
Stanovich and Richard West, and will refer to two systems in the mind,
System 1 and System 2.
 
System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort
and no sense of voluntary control.
System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that
demand it, including complex computations. The operations of
System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of
agency, choice, and concentration.
The labels of System 1 and System 2 are widely used in psychology, but I
go further than most in this book, which you can read as a psychodrama
with two characters.
When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2, the conscious,
reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think
about and what to do. Although System 2 believes itself to be where the
action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book. I describe
System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the
main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2.
The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex
patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an
orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2
takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of
System 1. You will be invited to think of the two systems as agents with
their individual abilities, limitations, and functions.
In rough order of complexity, here are some examples of the automatic
activities that are attributed to System 1:
 
Detect that one object is more distant than another.
Orient to the source of a sudden sound.
Complete the phrase “bread and…”
Make a “disgust face” when shown a horrible picture.
Detect hostility in a voice.
Answer to 2 + 2 = ?
Read words on large billboards.
Drive a car on an empty road.
Find a strong move in chess (if you are a chess master).
Understand simple sentences.
Recognize that a “meek and tidy soul with a passion for detail”
resembles an occupational stereotype.
All these mental events belong with the angry woman—they occur
automatically and require little or no effort. The capabilities of System 1
include innate skills that we share with other animals. We are born
prepared to perceive the world around us, recognize objects, orient
attention, avoid losses, and fear spiders. Other mental activities become
fast and automatic through prolonged practice. System 1 has learned
associations between ideas (the capital of France?); it has also learned
skills such as reading and understanding nuances of social situations.
Some skills, such as finding strong chess moves, are acquired only by
specialized experts. Others are widely shared. Detecting the similarity of a
personality sketch to an occupatiohein occupatnal stereotype requires
broad knowledge of the language and the culture, which most of us
possess. The knowledge is stored in memory and accessed without
intention and without effort.
Several of the mental actions in the list are completely involuntary. You
cannot refrain from understanding simple sentences in your own language
or from orienting to a loud unexpected sound, nor can you prevent yourself
from knowing that 2 + 2 = 4 or from thinking of Paris when the capital of
France is mentioned. Other activities, such as chewing, are susceptible to
voluntary control but normally run on automatic pilot. The control of attention
is shared by the two systems. Orienting to a loud sound is normally an
involuntary operation of System 1, which immediately mobilizes the
voluntary attention of System 2. You may be able to resist turning toward
the source of a loud and offensive comment at a crowded party, but even if
your head does not move, your attention is initially directed to it, at least for
a while. However, attention can be moved away from an unwanted focus,
primarily by focusing intently on another target.
The highly diverse operations of System 2 have one feature in common:
they require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away.
Here are some examples:
 
Brace for the starter gun in a race.
Focus attention on the clowns in the circus.
Focus on the voice of a particular person in a crowded and noisy
room.
Look for a woman with white hair.
Search memory to identify a surprising sound.
Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you.
Monitor the appropriateness of your behavior in a social situation.
Count the occurrences of the letter a in a page of text.
Tell someone your phone number.
Park in a narrow space (for most people except garage attendants).
Compare two washing machines for overall value.
Fill out a tax form.
Check the validity of a complex logical argument.
In all these situations you must pay attention, and you will perform less well,
or not at all, if you are not ready or if your attention is directed
inappropriately. System 2 has some ability to change the way System 1
works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and
memory. When waiting for a relative at a busy train station, for example,
you can set yourself at will to look for a white-haired woman or a bearded
man, and thereby increase the likelihood of detecting your relative from a
distance. You can set your memory to search for capital cities that start
with N or for French existentialist novels. And when you rent a car at
London’s Heathrow Airport, the attendant will probably remind you that “we
drive on the left side of the road over here.” In all these cases, you are
asked to do something that does not come naturally, and you will find that
the consistent maintenance of a set requires continuous exertion of at least
some effort.
The often-used phrase “pay attention” is apt: you dispose of a limited
budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to
i>Cyou try tgo beyond your budget, you will fail. It is the mark of effortful
activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or
impossible to conduct several at once. You could not compute the product
of 17 × 24 while making a left turn into dense traffic, and you certainly
should not try. You can do several things at once, but only if they are easy
and undemanding. You are probably safe carrying on a conversation with a
passenger while driving on an empty highway, and many parents have
discovered, perhaps with some guilt, that they can read a story to a child
while thinking of something else.
Everyone has some awareness of the limited capacity of attention, and
our social behavior makes allowances for these limitations. When the
driver of a car is overtaking a truck on a narrow road, for example, adult
passengers quite sensibly stop talking. They know that distracting the
driver is not a good idea, and they also suspect that he is temporarily deaf
and will not hear what they say.
Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to
stimuli that normally attract attention. The most dramatic demonstration
was offered by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons in their book The
Invisible Gorilla. They constructed a short film of two teams passing
basketballs, one team wearing white shirts, the other wearing black. The
viewers of the film are instructed to count the number of passes made by
the white team, ignoring the black players. This task is difficult and
completely absorbing. Halfway through the video, a woman wearing a
gorilla suit appears, crosses the court, thumps her chest, and moves on.
The gorilla is in view for 9 seconds. Many thousands of people have seen
the video, and about half of them do not notice anything unusual. It is the
counting task—and especially the instruction to ignore one of the teams—
that causes the blindness. No one who watches the video without that task
would miss the gorilla. Seeing and orienting are automatic functions of
System 1, but they depend on the allocation of some attention to the
relevant stimulus. The authors note that the most remarkable observation
of their study is that people find its results very surprising. Indeed, the
viewers who fail to see the gorilla are initially sure that it was not there—
they cannot imagine missing such a striking event. The gorilla study
illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the
obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.
Plot Synopsis
The interaction of the two systems is a recurrent theme of the book, and a
brief synopsis of the plot is in order. In the story I will tell, Systems 1 and 2
are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and
System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a
fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates
suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings.
If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and
impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most
of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no
modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your
desires, and that is fine—usually.
When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more
detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the
moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1
does not offer an answer, as probably happened to you when you
encountered the multiplication problem 17 × 24. You can also feel a surge
of conscious attention whenever you are surprised. System 2 is activ">< 2
is actated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world
that System 1 maintains. In that world, lamps do not jump, cats do not bark,
and gorillas do not cross basketball courts. The gorilla experiment
demonstrates that some attention is needed for the surprising stimulus to
be detected. Surprise then activates and orients your attention: you will
stare, and you will search your memory for a story that makes sense of the
surprising event. System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring
of your own behavior—the control that keeps you polite when you are
angry, and alert when you are driving at night. System 2 is mobilized to
increased effort when it detects an error about to be made. Remember a
time when you almost blurted out an offensive remark and note how hard
you worked to restore control. In summary, most of what you (your System
2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when
things get difficult, and it normally has the last word.
The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient:
it minimizes effort and optimizes performance. The arrangement works
well most of the time because System 1 is generally very good at what it
does: its models of familiar situations are accurate, its short-term
predictions are usually accurate as well, and its initial reactions to
challenges are swift and generally appropriate. System 1 has biases,
however, systematic errors that it is prone to make in specified
circumstances. As we shall see, it sometimes answers easier questions
than the one it was asked, and it has little understanding of logic and
statistics. One further limitation of System 1 is that it cannot be turned off. If
you are shown a word on the screen in a language you know, you will read
it—unless your attention is totally focused elsewhere.
Conflict
Figure 2 is a variant of a classic experiment that produces a conflict
between the two systems. You should try the exercise before reading on.
Figure 2
You were almost certainly successful in saying the correct words in both
tasks, and you surely discovered that some parts of each task were much
easier than others. When you identified upper- and lowercase, the left-
hand column was easy and the right-hand column caused you to slow down
y
g
y
and perhaps to stammer or stumble. When you named the position of
words, the left-hand column was difficult and the right-hand column was
much easier.
These tasks engage System 2, because saying “upper/lower” or
“right/left” is not what you routinely do when looking down a column of
words. One of the things you did to set yourself for the task was to program
your memory so that the relevant words (upper and lower for the first task)
were “on the tip of your tongue.” The prioritizing of the chosen words is
effective and the mild temptation to read other words was fairly easy to
resist when you went through the first column. But the second column was
different, because it contained words for which you were set, and you could
not ignore them. You were mostly able to respond correctly, but
overcoming the competing response was a strain, and it slowed you down.
You experienced a conflict between a task that you intended to carry out
and an automatic response that interfered with it.
Conflict between an automatic reaction and an intention to conWhetion
to ctrol it is common in our lives. We are all familiar with the experience of
trying not to stare at the oddly dressed couple at the neighboring table in a
restaurant. We also know what it is like to force our attention on a boring
book, when we constantly find ourselves returning to the point at which the
reading lost its meaning. Where winters are hard, many drivers have
memories of their car skidding out of control on the ice and of the struggle
to follow well-rehearsed instructions that negate what they would naturally
do: “Steer into the skid, and whatever you do, do not touch the brakes!”
And every human being has had the experience of not telling someone to
go to hell. One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of
System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control.
Illusions
To appreciate the autonomy of System 1, as well as the distinction
between impressions and beliefs, take a good look at figure 3.
This picture is unremarkable: two horizontal lines of different lengths,
with fins appended, pointing in different directions. The bottom line is
obviously longer than the one above it. That is what we all see, and we
naturally believe what we see. If you have already encountered this image,
however, you recognize it as the famous Müller-Lyer illusion. As you can
easily confirm by measuring them with a ruler, the horizontal lines are in
fact identical in length.
Figure 3
Now that you have measured the lines, you—your System 2, the
conscious being you call “I”—have a new belief: you know that the lines are
equally long. If asked about their length, you will say what you know. But you
still see the bottom line as longer. You have chosen to believe the
measurement, but you cannot prevent System 1 from doing its thing; you
cannot decide to see the lines as equal, although you know they are. To
resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do: you must learn to
mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to
them. To implement that rule, you must be able to recognize the illusory
pattern and recall what you know about it. If you can do this, you will never
again be fooled by the Müller-Lyer illusion. But you will still see one line as
longer than the other.
Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call
cognitive illusions. As a graduate student, I attended some courses on the
art and science of psychotherapy. During one of these lectures, our
teacher imparted a morsel of clinical wisdom. This is what he told us: “You
will from time to time meet a patient who shares a disturbing tale of
multiple mistakes in his previous treatment. He has been seen by several
clinicians, and all failed him. The patient can lucidly describe how his
therapists misunderstood him, but he has quickly perceived that you are
different. You share the same feeling, are convinced that you understand
him, and will be able to help.” At this point my teacher raised his voice as
he said, “Do not even think of taking on this patient! Throw him out of the
office! He is most likely a psychopath and you will not be able to help him.”
Many years later I learned that the teacher had warned us against
psychopathic charm, and the leading authority in the strn y in the udy of
psychopathy confirmed that the teacher’s advice was sound. The analogy
to the Müller-Lyer illusion is close. What we were being taught was not how
to feel about that patient. Our teacher took it for granted that the sympathy
we would feel for the patient would not be under our control; it would arise
from System 1. Furthermore, we were not being taught to be generally
suspicious of our feelings about patients. We were told that a strong
attraction to a patient with a repeated history of failed treatment is a
danger sign—like the fins on the parallel lines. It is an illusion—a cognitive
illusion—and I (System 2) was taught how to recognize it and advised not
to believe it or act on it.
The question that is most often asked about cognitive illusions is
whether they can be overcome. The message of these examples is not
encouraging. Because System 1 operates automatically and cannot be
turned off at will, errors of intuitive thought are often difficult to prevent.
Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to
the error. Even when cues to likely errors are availabl
