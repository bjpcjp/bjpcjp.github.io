Appendix B: Choices, Values, And Frames*
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky
ABSTRACT: We discuss the cognitive and the psychophysical
determinants of choice in risky and riskless contexts. The psychophysics
of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in
the domain of losses. The psychophysics of chance induce
overweighting of sure things and of improbable events, relative to events
of moderate probability. Decision problems can be described or framed
in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the
invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting,
in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some
anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an
option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost
or as an uncompensated loss. The relation between decision values and
experience values is discussed.
Making decisions is like speaking prose—people do it all the time,
knowingly or unknowingly. It is hardly surprising, then, that the topic of
decision making is shared by many disciplines, from mathematics and
statistics, through economics and political science, to sociology and
psychology. The study of decisions addresses both normative and
descriptive questions. The normative analysis is concerned with the nature
of rationality and the logic of decision making. The descriptive analysis, in
contrast, is concerned with people’s beliefs and preferences as they are,
not as they should be. The tension between normative and descriptive
considerations characterizes much of the study of judgment and choice.
Analyses of decision making commonly distinguish risky and riskless
choices. The paradigmatic example of decision un ^v>
Risky Choice
Risky choices, such as whether or not to take an umbrella and whether or
not to go to war, are made without advance knowledge of their
consequences. Because the consequences of such actions depend on
uncertain events such as the weather or the opponent’s resolve, the choice
of an act may be construed as the acceptance of a gamble that can yield
various outcomes with different probabilities. It is therefore natural that the
study of decision making under risk has focused on choices between
simple gambles with monetary outcomes and specified probabilities, in
the hope that these simple problems will reveal basic attitudes toward risk
and value.
We shall sketch an approach to risky choice that derives many of its
hypotheses from a psychophysical analysis of responses to money and to
probability. The psychophysical approach to decision making can be
traced to a remarkable essay that Daniel Bernoulli published in 1738
(Bernoulli 1954) in which he attempted to explain why people are generally
averse to risk and why risk aversion decreases with increasing wealth. To
illustrate risk aversion and Bernoulli’s analysis, consider the choice
between a prospect that offers an 85% chance to win $1,000 (with a 15%
chance to win nothing) and the alternative of receiving $800 for sure. A
large majority of people prefer the sure thing over the gamble, although the
gamble has higher (mathematical) expectation. The expectation of a
monetary gamble is a weighted average, where each possible outcome is
weighted by its probability of occurrence. The expectation of the gamble in
this example is .85 × $1,000 + .15 × $0 = $850, which exceeds the
expectation of $800 associated with the sure thing. The preference for the
sure gain is an instance of risk aversion. In general, a preference for a sure
outcome over a gamble that has higher or equal expectation is called risk
averse, and the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or
equal expectation is called risk seeking.
Bernoulli suggested that people do not evaluate prospects by the
expectation of their monetary outcomes, but rather by the expectation of
the subjective value of these outcomes. The subjective value of a gamble
is again a weighted average, but now it is the subjective value of each
outcome that is weighted by its probability. To explain risk aversion within
this framework, Bernoulli proposed that subjective value, or utility, is a
concave function of money. In such a function, the difference between the
utilities of $200 and $100, for example, is greater than the utility difference
between $1,200 and $1,100. It follows from concavity that the subjective
value attached to a gain of $800 is more than 80% of the value of a gain of
$1,000. Consequently, the concavity of the utility function entails a risk
averse preference for a sure gain of $800 over an 80% chance to win
$1,000, although the two prospects have the same monetary expectation.
It is customary in decision analysis to describe the outcomes of
decisions in terms of total wealth. For example, an offer to bet $20 on the
toss of a fair coin is represented as a choice between an individual’s
current wealth W and an even chance to move to W + $20 or to Wn
indispan> – $20. This representation appears psychologically unrealistic:
People do not normally think of relatively small outcomes in terms of states
of wealth but rather in terms of gains, losses, and neutral outcomes (such
as the maintenance of the status quo). If the effective carriers of subjective
value are changes of wealth rather than ultimate states of wealth, as we
propose, the psychophysical analysis of outcomes should be applied to
gains and losses rather than to total assets. This assumption plays a
central role in a treatment of risky choice that we called prospect theory
(Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Introspection as well as psychophysical
measurements suggest that subjective value is a concave function of the
size of a gain. The same generalization applies to losses as well. The
difference in subjective value between a loss of $200 and a loss of $100
appears greater than the difference in subjective value between a loss of
$1,200 and a loss of $1,100. When the value functions for gains and for
losses are pieced together, we obtain an S-shaped function of the type
displayed in Figure 1.
Figure 1. A Hypothetical Value Function
The value function shown in Figure 1 is (a) defined on gains and losses
rather than on total wealth, (b) concave in the domain of gains and convex
in the domain of losses, and (c) considerably steeper for losses than for
gains. The last property, which we label loss aversion, expresses the
intuition that a loss of $X is more aversive than a gain of $X is attractive.
Loss aversion explains people’s reluctance to bet on a fair coin for equal
stakes: The attractiveness of the possible gain is not nearly sufficient to
compensate for the aversiveness of the possible loss. For example, most
respondents in a sample of undergraduates refused to stake $10 on the
toss of a coin if they stood to win less than $30.
The assumption of risk aversion has played a central role in economic
theory. However, just as the concavity of the value of gains entails risk
aversion, the convexity of the value of losses entails risk seeking. Indeed,
risk seeking in losses is a robust effect, particularly when the probabilities
of loss are substantial. Consider, for example, a situation in which an
individual is forced to choose between an 85% chance to lose $1,000
(with a 15% chance to lose nothing) and a sure loss of $800. A large
majority of people express a preference for the gamble over the sure loss.
This is a risk seeking choice because the expectation of the gamble (–
$850) is inferior to the expectation of the sure loss (–$800). Risk seeking
in the domain of losses has been confirmed by several investigators
(Fishburn and Kochenberger 1979; Hershey and Schoemaker 1980;
Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum 1980; Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein
1982). It has also been observed with nonmonetary outcomes, such as
hours of pain (Eraker and Sox 1981) and loss of human lives (Fischhoff
1983; Tversky 1977; Tversky and Kahneman 1981). Is it wrong to be risk
averse in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses?
These preferences conform to compelling intuitions about the subjective
value of gains and losses, and the presumption is that people should be
entitled to their own values. However, we shall see that an S-shaped value
function has implications that are normatively unacceptable.
To address the normative issue we turn from psychology to decision
theory. Modern decision theory can be said to begin with the pioneering
work of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947), who laid down several
qualitative principles, or axioms, that should g ctha211;$850)overn the
preferences of a rational decision maker. Their axioms included transitivity
(if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C),
and substitution (if A is preferred to B, then an even chance to get A or C is
preferred to an even chance to get B or C), along with other conditions of a
more technical nature. The normative and the descriptive status of the
axioms of rational choice have been the subject of extensive discussions.
In particular, there is convincing evidence that people do not always obey
the substitution axiom, and considerable disagreement exists about the
normative merit of this axiom (e.g., Allais and Hagen 1979). However, all
analyses of rational choice incorporate two principles: dominance and
invariance. Dominance demands that if prospect A is at least as good as
prospect B in every respect and better than B in at least one respect, then
A should be preferred to B. Invariance requires that the preference order
between prospects should not depend on the manner in which they are
described. In particular, two versions of a choice problem that are
recognized to be equivalent when shown together should elicit the same
preference even when shown separately. We now show that the
requirement of invariance, however elementary and innocuous it may
seem, cannot generally be satisfied.
Framing of Outcomes
Risky prospects are characterized by their possible outcomes and by the
probabilities of these outcomes. The same option, however, can be
framed or described in different ways (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). For
example, the possible outcomes of a gamble can be framed either as
gains and losses relative to the status quo or as asset positions that
incorporate initial wealth. Invariance requires that such changes in the
description of outcomes should not alter the preference order. The
following pair of problems illustrates a violation of this requirement. The
total number of respondents in each problem is denoted by N, and the
percentage who chose each option is indicated in parentheses.
Problem 1 (N = 152): Imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the
outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill
600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease
have been proposed. Assume that the exact scientific estimates
of the consequences of the programs are as follows:
If Program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved. (72%)
If Program B is adopted, there is a one-third probability that
600 people will be saved and a two-thirds probability that no
people will be saved. (28%)
Which of the two programs would you favor?
The formulation of Problem 1 implicitly adopts as a reference point a
state of affairs in which the disease is allowed to take its toll of 600 lives.
The outcomes of the programs include the reference state and two
possible gains, measured by the number of lives saved. As expected,
preferences are risk averse: A clear majority of respondents prefer saving
200 lives for sure over a gamble that offers a one-third chance of saving
600 lives. Now consider another problem in which the same cover story is
followed by a different description of the prospects associated with the two
programs:
Problem 2 (N = 155):
If Program C is adopted, 400 people will die. (22%)
If Program D is adopted, there is a one-third probability that
nobody will die and a two-thirds probability that 600 people will
die. (78%)
It is easy to verify that options C and D in Problem 2 are
undistinguishable in real terms from options A and B in Problem 1,
respectively. The second version, however, assumes a reference state in
which no one dies of the disease. The best outcome is the maintenance of
this state and the alternatives are losses measured by the number of
people that will die of the disease. People who evaluate options in these
terms are expected to show a risk seeking preference for the gamble
(option D) over the sure loss of 400 lives. Indeed, there is more risk
seeking in the second version of the problem than there is risk aversion in
the first.
The failure of invariance is both pervasive and robust. It is as common
among sophisticated respondents as among naive ones, and it is not
eliminated even when the same respondents answer both questions within
a few minutes. Respondents confronted with their conflicting answers are
typically puzzled. Even after rereading the problems, they still wish to be
risk averse in the “lives saved” version; they wish to be risk seeking in the
“lives lost” version; and they also wish to obey invariance and give
consistent answers in the two versions. In their stubborn appeal, framing
effects resemble perceptual illusions more than computational errors.
The following pair of problems elicits preferences that violate the
dominance requirement of rational choice.
Problem 3 (N = 86): Choose between:
E. 25% chance to win $240 and 75% chance to lose $760 (0%)
F. 25% chance to win $250 and 75% chance to lose $750 (100%)
It is easy to see that F dominates E. Indeed, all respondents chose
accordingly.
Problem 4 (N = 150): Imagine that you face the following pair of
concurrent decisions.
First examine both decisions, then indicate the options you
prefer.
Decision (i) Choose between:
A. a sure gain of $240 (84%)
B. 25% chance to gain $1,000 and 75% chance to gain nothing (16%)
Decision (ii) Choose between:
C. a sure loss of $750 (13%)
D. 75% chance to lose $1,000 and 25% chance to lose nothing (87%)
As expected from the previous analysis, a large majority of subjects
made a risk averse choice for the sure gain over the positive gamble in the
first decision, and an even larger majority of subjects made a risk seeking
choice for the gamble over the sure loss in the second decision. In fact,
73% of the respondents chose A and D and only 3% chose B and C. The
same cd Cce f pattern of results was observed in a modified version of the
problem, with reduced stakes, in which undergraduates selected gambles
that they would actually play.
Because the subjects considered the two decisions in Problem 4
simultaneously, they expressed in effect a preference for A and D over B
and C. The preferred conjunction, however, is actually dominated by the
rejected one. Adding the sure gain of $240 (option A) to option D yields a
25% chance to win $240 and a 75% chance to lose $760. This is precisely
option E in Problem 3. Similarly, adding the sure loss of $750 (option C) to
option B yields a 25% chance to win $250 and a 75% chance to lose
$750. This is precisely option F in Problem 3. Thus, the susceptibility to
framing and the S-shaped value function produce a violation of dominance
in a set of concurrent decisions.
The moral of these results is disturbing: Invariance is normatively
essential, intuitively compelling, and psychologically unfeasible. Indeed, we
conceive only two ways of guaranteeing invariance. The first is to adopt a
procedure that will transform equivalent versions of any problem into the
same canonical representation. This is the rationale for the standard
admonition to students of business, that they should consider each
decision problem in terms of total assets rather than in terms of gains or
losses (Schlaifer 1959). Such a representation would avoid the violations
of invariance illustrated in the previous problems, but the advice is easier
to give than to follow. Except in the context of possible ruin, it is more
natural to consider financial outcomes as gains and losses rather than as
states of wealth. Furthermore, a canonical representation of risky
prospects requires a compounding of all outcomes of concurrent decisions
(e.g., Problem 4) that exceeds the capabilities of intuitive computation
even in simple problems. Achieving a canonical representation is even
more difficult in other contexts such as safety, health, or quality of life.
Should we advise people to evaluate the consequence of a public health
policy (e.g., Problems 1 and 2) in terms of overall mortality, mortality due to
diseases, or the number of deaths associated with the particular disease
under study?
Another approach that could guarantee invariance is the evaluation of
options in terms of their actuarial rather than their psychological
consequences. The actuarial criterion has some appeal in the context of
human lives, but it is clearly inadequate for financial choices, as has been
generally recognized at least since Bernoulli, and it is entirely inapplicable
to outcomes that lack an objective metric. We conclude that frame
invariance cannot be expected to hold and that a sense of confidence in a
particular choice does not ensure that the same choice would be made in
another frame. It is therefore good practice to test the robustness of
preferences by deliberate attempts to frame a decision problem in more
than one way (Fischhoff, Slovic, and Lichtenstein 1980).
The Psychophysics of Chances
Our discussion so far has assumed a Bernoullian expectation rule
according to which the value, or utility, of an uncertain prospect is obtained
by adding the utilities of the possible outcomes, each weighted by its
probability. To examine this assumption, let us again consult
psychophysical intuitions. Setting the value of the status quo at zero,
imagine a cash gift, say of $300, and assign it a value of one. Now
imagine that you are only given a ticket to a lottery that has a single prize of
$300. How does the value of the ticket vary as a function of the probability
of winning the prize? Barring utility for gambling, the value of such a
prospect must vary between zero (when the chance of winning is nil
cinntric. We) and one (when winning $300 is a certainty).
Intuition suggests that the value of the ticket is not a linear function of the
probability of winning, as entailed by the expectation rule. In particular, an
increase from 0% to 5% appears to have a larger effect than an increase
from 30% to 35%, which also appears smaller than an increase from 95%
to 100%. These considerations suggest a category-boundary effect: A
change from impossibility to possibility or from possibility to certainty has a
bigger impact than a comparable change in the middle of the scale. This
hypothesis is incorporated into the curve displayed in Figure 2, which plots
the weight attached to an event as a function of its stated numerical
probability. The most salient feature of Figure 2 is that decision weights
are regressive with respect to stated probabilities. Except near the
endpoints, an increase of .05 in the probability of winning increases the
value of the prospect by less than 5% of the value of the prize. We next
investigate the implications of these psychophysical hypotheses for
preferences among risky options.
Figure 2. A Hypothetical Weighting Function
In Figure 2, decision weights are lower than the corresponding
probabilities over most of the range. Underweighting of moderate and high
probabilities relative to sure things contributes to risk aversion in gains by
reducing the attractiveness of positive gambles. The same effect also
contributes to risk seeking in losses by attenuating the aversiveness of
negative gambles. Low probabilities, however, are overweighted, and very
low probabilities are either overweighted quite grossly or neglected
altogether, making the decision weights highly unstable in that region. The
overweighting of lo
