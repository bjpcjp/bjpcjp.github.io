Life as a Story
Early in the days of my work on the measurement of experience, I saw
Verdi’s opera La Traviata. Known for its gorgeous music, it is also a
moving story of the love between a young aristocrat and Violetta, a woman
of the demimonde. The young man’s father approaches Violetta and
convinces her to give up her lover, to protect the honor of the family and the
marriage prospects of the young man’s sister. In an act of supreme self-
sacrifice, Violetta pretends to reject the man she adores. She soon
relapses into consumption (the nineteenth-century term for tuberculosis). In
the final act, Violetta lies dying, surrounded by a few friends. Her beloved
has been alerted and is rushing to Paris to see her. H Kto earing the news,
she is transformed with hope and joy, but she is also deteriorating quickly.
No matter how many times you have seen the opera, you are gripped by
the tension and fear of the moment: Will the young lover arrive in time?
There is a sense that it is immensely important for him to join his beloved
before she dies. He does, of course, some marvelous love duets are sung,
and after 10 minutes of glorious music Violetta dies.
On my way home from the opera, I wondered: Why do we care so much
about those last 10 minutes? I quickly realized that I did not care at all
about the length of Violetta’s life. If I had been told that she died at age 27,
not age 28 as I believed, the news that she had missed a year of happy life
would not have moved me at all, but the possibility of missing the last 10
minutes mattered a great deal. Furthermore, the emotion I felt about the
lovers’ reunion would not have changed if I had learned that they actually
had a week together, rather than 10 minutes. If the lover had come too late,
however, La Traviata would have been an altogether different story. A story
is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time
passing. Duration neglect is normal in a story, and the ending often defines
its character. The same core features appear in the rules of narratives and
in the memories of colonoscopies, vacations, and films. This is how the
remembering self works: it composes stories and keeps them for future
reference.
It is not only at the opera that we think of life as a story and wish it to end
well. When we hear about the death of a woman who had been estranged
from her daughter for many years, we want to know whether they were
reconciled as death approached. We do not care only about the
daughter’s feelings—it is the narrative of the mother’s life that we wish to
improve. Caring for people often takes the form of concern for the quality of
their stories, not for their feelings. Indeed, we can be deeply moved even
by events that change the stories of people who are already dead. We feel
pity for a man who died believing in his wife’s love for him, when we hear
that she had a lover for many years and stayed with her husband only for
his money. We pity the husband although he had lived a happy life. We feel
the humiliation of a scientist who made an important discovery that was
proved false after she died, although she did not experience the
humiliation. Most important, of course, we all care intensely for the
narrative of our own life and very much want it to be a good story, with a
decent hero.
The psychologist Ed Diener and his students wondered whether
duration neglect and the peak-end rule would govern evaluations of entire
lives. They used a short description of the life of a fictitious character called
Jen, a never-married woman with no children, who died instantly and
painlessly in an automobile accident. In one version of Jen’s story, she was
extremely happy throughout her life (which lasted either 30 or 60 years),
enjoying her work, taking vacations, spending time with her friends and on
her hobbies. Another version added 5 extra years to Jen’s life, who now
died either when she was 35 or 65. The extra years were described as
pleasant but less so than before. After reading a schematic biography of
Jen, each participant answered two questions: “Taking her life as a whole,
how desirable do you think Jen’s life was?” and “How much total
happiness or unhappiness would you say that Jen experienced in her life?”
The results provided clear evidence of both duration neglect and a peak-
end effect. In a between-subjects experiment (different participants saw
different forms), doubling the duration of Jen’s life had Jto Aad Jto no
effect whatsoever on the desirability of her life, or on judgments of the total
happiness that Jen experienced. Clearly, her life was represented by a
prototypical slice of time, not as a sequence of time slices. As a
consequence, her “total happiness” was the happiness of a typical period
in her lifetime, not the sum (or integral) of happiness over the duration of
her life.
As expected from this idea, Diener and his students also found a less-
is-more effect, a strong indication that an average (prototype) has been
substituted for a sum. Adding 5 “slightly happy” years to a very happy life
caused a substantial drop in evaluations of the total happiness of that life.
At my urging, they also collected data on the effect of the extra 5 years in
a within-subject experiment; each participant made both judgments in
immediate succession. In spite of my long experience with judgment
errors, I did not believe that reasonable people could say that adding 5
slightly happy years to a life would make it substantially worse. I was
wrong. The intuition that the disappointing extra 5 years made the whole
life worse was overwhelming.
The pattern of judgments seemed so absurd that Diener and his
students initially thought that it represented the folly of the young people
who participated in their experiments. However, the pattern did not change
when the parents and older friends of students answered the same
questions. In intuitive evaluation of entire lives as well as brief episodes,
peaks and ends matter but duration does not.
The pains of labor and the benefits of vacations always come up as
objections to the idea of duration neglect: we all share the intuition that it is
much worse for labor to last 24 than 6 hours, and that 6 days at a good
resort is better than 3. Duration appears to matter in these situations, but
this is only because the quality of the end changes with the length of the
episode. The mother is more depleted and helpless after 24 hours than
after 6, and the vacationer is more refreshed and rested after 6 days than
after 3. What truly matters when we intuitively assess such episodes is the
progressive deterioration or improvement of the ongoing experience, and
how the person feels at the end.
Amnesic Vacations
Consider the choice of a vacation. Do you prefer to enjoy a relaxing week
at the familiar beach to which you went last year? Or do you hope to enrich
your store of memories? Distinct industries have developed to cater to
these alternatives: resorts offer restorative relaxation; tourism is about
helping people construct stories and collect memories. The frenetic picture
taking of many tourists suggests that storing memories is often an
important goal, which shapes both the plans for the vacation and the
experience of it. The photographer does not view the scene as a moment
to be savored but as a future memory to be designed. Pictures may be
useful to the remembering self—though we rarely look at them for very
long, or as often as we expected, or even at all—but picture taking is not
necessarily the best way for the tourist’s experiencing self to enjoy a view.
In many cases we evaluate touristic vacations by the story and the
memories that we expect to store. The word memorable is often used to
describe vacation highlights, explicitly revealing the goal of the experience.
In other situations—love comes to mind—the declaration that the present
moment will never be forgotten, though not always accurate, changes the
character of the moment. A self-consciously memorable experience gains
a weight and a significance Jto Ace Jto that it would not otherwise have.
Ed Diener and his team provided evidence that it is the remembering
self that chooses vacations. They asked students to maintain daily diaries
and record a daily evaluation of their experiences during spring break. The
students also provided a global rating of the vacation when it had ended.
Finally, they indicated whether or not they intended to repeat or not to
repeat the vacation they had just had. Statistical analysis established that
the intentions for future vacations were entirely determined by the final
evaluation—even when that score did not accurately represent the quality
of the experience that was described in the diaries. As in the cold-hand
experiment, right or wrong, people choose by memory when they decide
whether or not to repeat an experience.
A thought experiment about your next vacation will allow you to observe
your attitude to your experiencing self.
At the end of the vacation, all pictures and videos will be
destroyed. Furthermore, you will swallow a potion that will wipe
out all your memories of the vacation.
How would this prospect affect your vacation plans? How much
would you be willing to pay for it, relative to a normally memorable
vacation?
While I have not formally studied the reactions to this scenario, my
impression from discussing it with people is that the elimination of
memories greatly reduces the value of the experience. In some cases,
people treat themselves as they would treat another amnesic, choosing to
maximize overall pleasure by returning to a place where they have been
happy in the past. However, some people say that they would not bother to
go at all, revealing that they care only about their remembering self, and
care less about their amnesic experiencing self than about an amnesic
stranger. Many point out that they would not send either themselves or
another amnesic to climb mountains or trek through the jungle—because
these experiences are mostly painful in real time and gain value from the
expectation that both the pain and the joy of reaching the goal will be
memorable.
For another thought experiment, imagine you face a painful operation
during which you will remain conscious. You are told you will scream in
pain and beg the surgeon to stop. However, you are promised an
amnesia-inducing drug that will completely wipe out any memory of the
episode. How do you feel about such a prospect? Here again, my informal
observation is that most people are remarkably indifferent to the pains of
their experiencing self. Some say they don’t care at all. Others share my
feeling, which is that I feel pity for my suffering self but not more than I would
feel for a stranger in pain. Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self,
and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.
Speaking of Life as a Story
“He is desperately trying to protect the narrative of a life of
integrity, which is endangered by the latest episode.”
“The length to which he was willing to go for a one-night encounter
is a sign of total duration neglect.”
“You seem to be devoting your entire vacation to the construction
of memories. Perhaps you should put away the camera and enjoy
the moment, even if it is not very memorable?”
“She is an Alzheimer’s patient. She no longer maintains a
narrative of her life, but her experiencing self is still sensitive to
beauty and gentleness.”
