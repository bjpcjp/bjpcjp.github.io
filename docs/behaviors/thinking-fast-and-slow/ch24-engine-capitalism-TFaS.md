The Engine of Capitalism
The planning fallacy is only one of the manifestations of a pervasive
optimistic bias. sid to adtions of aMost of us view the world as more
benign than it really is, our own attributes as more favorable than they truly
are, and the goals we adopt as more achievable than they are likely to be.
We also tend to exaggerate our ability to forecast the future, which fosters
optimistic overconfidence. In terms of its consequences for decisions, the
optimistic bias may well be the most significant of the cognitive biases.
Because optimistic bias can be both a blessing and a risk, you should be
both happy and wary if you are temperamentally optimistic.
Optimists
Optimism is normal, but some fortunate people are more optimistic than
the rest of us. If you are genetically endowed with an optimistic bias, you
hardly need to be told that you are a lucky person—you already feel
fortunate. An optimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it is part of a
general disposition for well-being, which may also include a preference for
seeing the bright side of everything. If you were allowed one wish for your
child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are
normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in
adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are
reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their
health, they feel healthier than others and are in fact likely to live longer. A
study of people who exaggerate their expected life span beyond actuarial
predictions showed that they work longer hours, are more optimistic about
their future income, are more likely to remarry after divorce (the classic
“triumph of hope over experience”), and are more prone to bet on
individual stocks. Of course, the blessings of optimism are offered only to
individuals who are only mildly biased and who are able to “accentuate the
positive” without losing track of reality.
Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping our lives.
Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the
entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders—not average people. They
got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They are
talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than they
acknowledge. They are probably optimistic by temperament; a survey of
founders of small businesses concluded that entrepreneurs are more
sanguine than midlevel managers about life in general. Their experiences
of success have confirmed their faith in their judgment and in their ability to
control events. Their self-confidence is reinforced by the admiration of
others. This reasoning leads to a hypothesis: the people who have the
greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and
overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize.
The evidence suggests that an optimistic bias plays a role—sometimes
the dominant role—whenever individuals or institutions voluntarily take on
significant risks. More often than not, risk takers underestimate the odds
they face, and do invest sufficient effort to find out what the odds are.
Because they misread the risks, optimistic entrepreneurs often believe
they are prudent, even when they are not. Their confidence in their future
success sustains a positive mood that helps them obtain resources from
others, raise the morale of their employees, and enhance their prospects
of prevailing. When action is needed, optimism, even of the mildly
delusional variety, may be a good thing.
Entrepreneurial Delusions
The chances that a small business will thesurvive for five years in the
United States are about 35%. But the individuals who open such
businesses do not believe that the statistics apply to them. A survey found
that American entrepreneurs tend to believe they are in a promising line of
business: their average estimate of the chances of success for “any
business like yours” was 60%—almost double the true value. The bias was
more glaring when people assessed the odds of their own venture. Fully
81% of the entrepreneurs put their personal odds of success at 7 out of 10
or higher, and 33% said their chance of failing was zero.
The direction of the bias is not surprising. If you interviewed someone
who recently opened an Italian restaurant, you would not expect her to have
underestimated her prospects for success or to have a poor view of her
ability as a restaurateur. But you must wonder: Would she still have
invested money and time if she had made a reasonable effort to learn the
odds—or, if she did learn the odds (60% of new restaurants are out of
business after three years), paid attention to them? The idea of adopting
the outside view probably didn’t occur to her.
One of the benefits of an optimistic temperament is that it encourages
persistence in the face of obstacles. But persistence can be costly. An
impressive series of studies by Thomas Åstebro sheds light on what
happens when optimists receive bad news. He drew his data from a
Canadian organization—the Inventor’s Assistance Program—which
collects a small fee to provide inventors with an objective assessment of
the commercial prospects of their idea. The evaluations rely on careful
ratings of each invention on 37 criteria, including need for the product, cost
of production, and estimated trend of demand. The analysts summarize
their ratings by a letter grade, where D and E predict failure—a prediction
made for over 70% of the inventions they review. The forecasts of failure
are remarkably accurate: only 5 of 411 projects that were given the lowest
grade reached commercialization, and none was successful.
Discouraging news led about half of the inventors to quit after receiving
a grade that unequivocally predicted failure. However, 47% of them
continued development efforts even after being told that their project was
hopeless, and on average these persistent (or obstinate) individuals
doubled their initial losses before giving up. Significantly, persistence after
discouraging advice was relatively common among inventors who had a
high score on a personality measure of optimism—on which inventors
generally scored higher than the general population. Overall, the return on
private invention was small, “lower than the return on private equity and on
high-risk securities.” More generally, the financial benefits of self-
employment are mediocre: given the same qualifications, people achieve
higher average returns by selling their skills to employers than by setting
out on their own. The evidence suggests that optimism is widespread,
stubborn, and costly.
Psychologists have confirmed that most people genuinely believe that
they are superior to most others on most desirable traits—they are willing
to bet small amounts of money on these beliefs in the laboratory. In the
market, of course, beliefs in one’s superiority have significant
consequences. Leaders of large businesses sometimes make huge bets
in expensive mergers and acquisitions, acting on the mistaken belief that
they can manage the assets of another company better than its current
owners do. The stock market commonly responds by downgrading the
value of the acquiring firm, because experience has shown that efforts to
integrate large firms fail more often than they succeed. The misguided
acquisitions have been explained by a “hubris hypothesis”: the eiv
xecutives of the acquiring firm are simply less competent than they think
they are.
The economists Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate identified
optimistic CEOs by the amount of company stock that they owned
personally and observed that highly optimistic leaders took excessive
risks. They assumed debt rather than issue equity and were more likely
than others to “overpay for target companies and undertake value-
destroying mergers.” Remarkably, the stock of the acquiring company
suffered substantially more in mergers if the CEO was overly optimistic by
the authors’ measure. The stock market is apparently able to identify
overconfident CEOs. This observation exonerates the CEOs from one
accusation even as it convicts them of another: the leaders of enterprises
who make unsound bets do not do so because they are betting with other
people’s money. On the contrary, they take greater risks when they
personally have more at stake. The damage caused by overconfident
CEOs is compounded when the business press anoints them as
celebrities; the evidence indicates that prestigious press awards to the
CEO are costly to stockholders. The authors write, “We find that firms with
award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform, in terms both of stock
and of operating performance. At the same time, CEO compensation
increases, CEOs spend more time on activities outside the company such
as writing books and sitting on outside boards, and they are more likely to
engage in earnings management.”
Many years ago, my wife and I were on vacation on Vancouver Island,
looking for a place to stay. We found an attractive but deserted motel on a
little-traveled road in the middle of a forest. The owners were a charming
young couple who needed little prompting to tell us their story. They had
been schoolteachers in the province of Alberta; they had decided to
change their life and used their life savings to buy this motel, which had
been built a dozen years earlier. They told us without irony or self-
consciousness that they had been able to buy it cheap, “because six or
seven previous owners had failed to make a go of it.” They also told us
about plans to seek a loan to make the establishment more attractive by
building a restaurant next to it. They felt no need to explain why they
expected to succeed where six or seven others had failed. A common
thread of boldness and optimism links businesspeople, from motel owners
to superstar CEOs.
The optimistic risk taking of entrepreneurs surely contributes to the
economic dynamism of a capitalistic society, even if most risk takers end
up disappointed. However, Marta Coelho of the London School of
Economics has pointed out the difficult policy issues that arise when
founders of small businesses ask the government to support them in
decisions that are most likely to end badly. Should the government provide
loans to would-be entrepreneurs who probably will bankrupt themselves in
a few years? Many behavioral economists are comfortable with the
“libertarian paternalistic” procedures that help people increase their
savings rate beyond what they would do on their own. The question of
whether and how government should support small business does not have
an equally satisfying answer.
Competition Neglect
It is tempting to explain entrepreneurial optimism by wishful thinking, but
emotion is only part of the story. Cognitive biases play an important role,
notably the System 1 feature WYSIATI.
 
We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base
rates, exposing ourselves to tnesehe planning fallacy.
We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans
and skills of others.
Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on
the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore
prone to an illusion of control.
We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which
makes us overly confident in our beliefs.
The observation that “90% of drivers believe they are better than
average” is a well-established psychological finding that has become part
of the culture, and it often comes up as a prime example of a more general
above-average effect. However, the interpretation of the finding has
changed in recent years, from self-aggrandizement to a cognitive bias.
Consider these two questions:
Are you a good driver?
Are you better than average as a driver?
The first question is easy and the answer comes quickly: most drivers say
yes. The second question is much harder and for most respondents almost
impossible to answer seriously and correctly, because it requires an
assessment of the average quality of drivers. At this point in the book it
comes as no surprise that people respond to a difficult question by
answering an easier one. They compare themselves to the average
without ever thinking about the average. The evidence for the cognitive
interpretation of the above-average effect is that when people are asked
about a task they find difficult (for many of us this could be “Are you better
than average in starting conversations with strangers?”), they readily rate
themselves as below average. The upshot is that people tend to be overly
optimistic about their relative standing on any activity in which they do
moderately well.
I have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in
innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your
effort depend on what you do in your firm? This is evidently an easy
question; the answer comes quickly and in my small sample it has never
been less than 80%. Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these
bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They are
surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the
achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its
own efforts. However, WY SIATI plays its part, and entrepreneurs naturally
focus on what they know best—their plans and actions and the most
immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding.
They know less about their competitors and therefore find it natural to
imagine a future in which the competition plays little part.
Colin Camerer and Dan Lovallo, who coined the concept of competition
neglect, illustrated it with a quote from the then chairman of Disney
Studios. Asked why so many expensive big-budget movies are released
on the same days (such as Memorial Day and Independence Day), he
replied:
Hubris. Hubris. If you only think about your own business, you
think, “I’ve got a good story department, I’ve got a good
marketing department, we’re going to go out and do this.” And
you don’t think that everybody else is thinking the same way. In a
given weekend in a year you’ll have five movies open, and there’s
certainly not enough people to go around. re
The candid answer refers to hubris, but it displays no arrogance, no
conceit of superiority to competing studios. The competition is simply not
part of the decision, in which a difficult question has again been replaced
by an easier one. The question that needs an answer is this: Considering
what others will do, how many people will see our film? The question the
studio executives considered is simpler and refers to knowledge that is
most easily available to them: Do we have a good film and a good
organization to market it? The familiar System 1 processes of WY SIATI
and substitution produce both competition neglect and the above-average
effect. The consequence of competition neglect is excess entry: more
competitors enter the market than the market can profitably sustain, so
their average outcome is a loss. The outcome is disappointing for the
typical entrant in the market, but the effect on the economy as a whole
could well be positive. In fact, Giovanni Dosi and Dan Lovallo call
entrepreneurial firms that fail but signal new markets to more qualified
competitors “optimistic martyrs”—good for the economy but bad for their
investors.
Overconfidence
For a number of years, professors at Duke University conducted a survey
in which the chief financial officers of large corporations estimated the
returns of the Standard & Poor’s index over the following year. The Duke
scholars collected 11,600 such forecasts and examined their accuracy.
The conclusion was straightforward: financial officers of large corporations
had no clue about the short-term future of the stock market; the correlation
between their estimates and the true value was slightly less than zero!
When they said the market would go down, it was slightly more likely than
not that it would go up. These findings are not surprising. The truly bad
news is that the CFOs did not appear to know that their forecasts were
worthless.
In addition to their best guess about S&P returns, the participants
provided two other estimates: a value that they were 90% sure would be
too high, and one that they were 90% sure would be too low. The range
between the two values is called an “80% confidence interval” and
outcomes that fall outside the interval are labeled “surprises.” An individual
who sets confidence intervals on multiple occasions expects about 20% of
the outcomes to be surprises. As frequently happens in such exercises,
there were far too many surprises; their incidence was 67%, more than 3
times higher than expected. This shows that CFOs were grossly
overconfident about their ability to forecast the market. Overconfidence is
another manifestation of WYSIATI: when we estimate a quantity, we rely on
information that comes to mind and construct a coherent story in which the
estimate makes sense. Allowing for the information that does not come to
mind—perhaps because one never knew it—is impossible.
The authors calculated the confidence intervals that would have reduced
the incidence of surprises to 20%. The results were striking. To maintain
the rate of surprises at the desired level, the CFOs should have said, year
after year, “There is an 80% chance that the S&P return next year will be
between –10% and +30%.” The confidence interval that properly reflects
the CFOs’ knowledge (more precisely, their ignorance) is more than 4
times wider than the intervals they actually stated.
Social psychology comes into the picture here, because the answer that
a truthful CFO would offer is plainly ridiculous. A CFO who informs his
colleagues that “th%">iere is a good chance that the S&P returns will be
between –10% and +30%” can expect to be laughed out of the room. The
wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance, which is not socially
acceptable for someone who is paid to be knowledgeable in financial
matters. Even if they knew how little they know, the executives would be
penalized for admitting it. President Truman famously asked for a “one-
armed economist” who would take a clear stand; he was sick and tired of
economists who kept saying, “On the other hand…”
Organizations that take the word of overconfident experts can expect
costly consequences. The study of CFOs showed that those who were
most confident and optimistic about the S&P index were also
overconfident and optimistic about the prospects of their own firm, which
went on to take more risk than others. As Nassim Taleb has argued,
inadequate appreciation of the uncertainty of the environment inevitably
leads economic agents to take risks they should avoid. However, optimism
is highly valued, socially and in the market; people and firms reward the
providers of dangerously misleading information more than they reward
truth tellers. One of the lessons of the financial crisis that led to the Great
Recession is that there are periods in which competition, among experts
and among organizations, creates powerful forces that favor a collective
blindness to risk and uncertainty.
The social and economic pressures that favor overconfidence are not
restricted to financial forecasting. Other professionals must deal with the
fact that an expert worthy of the name is expected to display high
confidence. Philip Tetlock observed that the most overconfident experts
were the most likely to be invited to strut their stuff in news shows.
Overconfidence also appears to be endemic in medicine. A study of
patients who died in the ICU compared autopsy results with the diagnosis
that physicians had provided while the patients were still alive. Physicians
also reported their confidence. The result: “clinicians who were ‘completely
certain’ of the diagnosis antemortem were wrong 40% of the time.” Here
again, expert overconfidence is e
