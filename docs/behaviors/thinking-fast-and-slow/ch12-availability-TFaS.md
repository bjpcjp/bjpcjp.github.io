The Science of Availability
Amos and I had our most productive year in 1971–72, which we spent in
Eugene, Oregon. We were the guests of the Oregon Research Institute,
which housed several future stars of all the fields in which we worked—
judgment, decision making, and intuitive prediction. Our main host was
Paul Slovic, who had been Amos’s classmate at Ann Arbor and remained
a lifelong friend. Paul was on his way to becoming the leading psychologist
among scholars of risk, a position he has held for decades, collecting
many honors along the way. Paul and his wife, Roz, introduced us to life in
Eugene, and soon we were doing what people in Eugene do—jogging,
barbecuing, and taking children to basketball games. We also worked very
hard, running dozens of experiments and writing our articles on judgment
heuristics. At night I wrote Attention and Effort. It was a busy year.
One of our projects was the study of what we called the availability
heuristic. We thought of that heuristic when we asked ourselves what
people actually do when they wish to estimate the frequency of a category,
such as “people who divorce after the age of 60” or “dangerous plants.”
The answer was straightforward: instances of the class will be retrieved
from memory, and if retrieval is easy and fluent, the category will be judged
to be large. We defined the availability heuristic as the process of judging
frequency by “the ease with which instances come to mind.” The statement
seemed clear when we formulated it, but the concept of availability has
been refined since then. The two-system approach had not yet been
developed when we studied availability, and we did not attempt to
determine whether this heuristic is a deliberate problem-solving strategy or
an automatic operation. We now know that both systems are involved.
A question we considered early was how many instances must be
retrieved to get an impression of the ease with which they come to mind.
We now know the answer: none. For an example, think of the number of
words that can be constructed from the two sets of letters below.

You knew almost immediately, without generating any instances, that one
set offers far more possibilities than the other, probably by a factor of 10 or
more. Similarly, you do not need to retrieve specific news stories to have a
good idea of the relative frequency with which different countries have
appeared in the news during the past year (Belgium, China, France,
Congo, Nicaragua, Romania…).
The availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, substitutes
one question for another: you wish to estimate the size se ost c d of a
category or the frequency of an event, but you report an impression of the
ease with which instances come to mind. Substitution of questions
inevitably produces systematic errors. You can discover how the heuristic
leads to biases by following a simple procedure: list factors other than
frequency that make it easy to come up with instances. Each factor in your
list will be a potential source of bias. Here are some examples:
 
A salient event that attracts your attention will be easily retrieved from
memory. Divorces among Hollywood celebrities and sex scandals
among politicians attract much attention, and instances will come
easily to mind. You are therefore likely to exaggerate the frequency of
both Hollywood divorces and political sex scandals.
A dramatic event temporarily increases the availability of its
category. A plane crash that attracts media coverage will temporarily
alter your feelings about the safety of flying. Accidents are on your
mind, for a while, after you see a car burning at the side of the road,
and the world is for a while a more dangerous place.
Personal experiences, pictures, and vivid examples are more
available than incidents that happened to others, or mere words, or
statistics. A judicial error that affects you will undermine your faith in
the justice system more than a similar incident you read about in a
newspaper.
Resisting this large collection of potential availability biases is possible,
but tiresome. You must make the effort to reconsider your impressions and
intuitions by asking such questions as, “Is our belief that theft s by
teenagers are a major problem due to a few recent instances in our
neighborhood?” or “Could it be that I feel no need to get a flu shot because
none of my acquaintances got the flu last year?” Maintaining one’s
vigilance against biases is a chore—but the chance to avoid a costly
mistake is sometimes worth the effort.
One of the best-known studies of availability suggests that awareness of
your own biases can contribute to peace in marriages, and probably in
other joint projects. In a famous study, spouses were asked, “How large
was your personal contribution to keeping the place tidy, in percentages?”
They also answered similar questions about “taking out the garbage,”
“initiating social engagements,” etc. Would the self-estimated contributions
add up to 100%, or more, or less? As expected, the self-assessed
contributions added up to more than 100%. The explanation is a simple
availability bias: both spouses remember their own individual efforts and
contributions much more clearly than those of the other, and the difference
in availability leads to a difference in judged frequency. The bias is not
necessarily self-serving: spouses also overestimated their contribution to
causing quarrels, although to a smaller extent than their contributions to
more desirable outcomes. The same bias contributes to the common
observation that many members of a collaborative team feel they have
done more than their share and also feel that the others are not adequately
grateful for their individual contributions.
I am generally not optimistic about the potential for personal control of
biases, but this is an exception. The opportunity for successful debiasing
exists because the circumstances in which issues of credit allocation
come up are easy to identify, the more so because tensions often arise
when several people at once feel that their efforts are not adequately
recognized. The mere observation that there is usually more than 100%
credit to go around is sometimes sufficient to defuse the situation. In any
eve#82ght=nt, it is a good thing for every individual to remember. You will
occasionally do more than your share, but it is useful to know that you are
likely to have that feeling even when each member of the team feels the
same way.
The Psychology of Availability
A major advance in the understanding of the availability heuristic occurred
in the early 1990s, when a group of German psychologists led by Norbert
Schwarz raised an intriguing question: How will people’s impressions of
the frequency of a category be affected by a requirement to list a specified
number of instances? Imagine yourself a subject in that experiment:
First, list six instances in which you behaved assertively.
Next, evaluate how assertive you are.
Imagine that you had been asked for twelve instances of assertive
behavior (a number most people find difficult). Would your view of your own
assertiveness be different?
Schwarz and his colleagues observed that the task of listing instances
may enhance the judgments of the trait by two different routes:
 
the number of instances retrieved
the ease with which they come to mind
The request to list twelve instances pits the two determinants against each
other. On the one hand, you have just retrieved an impressive number of
cases in which you were assertive. On the other hand, while the first three
or four instances of your own assertiveness probably came easily to you,
you almost certainly struggled to come up with the last few to complete a
set of twelve; fluency was low. Which will count more—the amount retrieved
or the ease and fluency of the retrieval?
The contest yielded a clear-cut winner: people who had just listed twelve
instances rated themselves as less assertive than people who had listed
only six. Furthermore, participants who had been asked to list twelve cases
in which they had not behaved assertively ended up thinking of themselves
as quite assertive! If you cannot easily come up with instances of meek
behavior, you are likely to conclude that you are not meek at all. Self-
ratings were dominated by the ease with which examples had come to
mind. The experience of fluent retrieval of instances trumped the number
retrieved.
An even more direct demonstration of the role of fluency was offered by
other psychologists in the same group. All the participants in their
experiment listed six instances of assertive (or nonassertive) behavior,
while maintaining a specified facial expression. “Smilers” were instructed
to contract the zygomaticus muscle, which produces a light smile;
“frowners” were required to furrow their brow. As you already know,
frowning normally accompanies cognitive strain and the effect is
symmetric: when people are instructed to frown while doing a task, they
actually try harder and experience greater cognitive strain. The
researchers anticipated that the frowners would have more difficulty
retrieving examples of assertive behavior and would therefore rate
themselves as relatively lacking in assertiveness. And so it was.
Psychologists enjoy experiments that yield paradoxical results, and they
have appliserv heighted Schwarz’s discovery with gusto. For example,
people:
 
believe that they use their bicycles less often after recalling many
rather than few instances
are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more
arguments to support it
are less confident that an event was avoidable after listing more
ways it could have been avoided
are less impressed by a car after listing many of its advantages
A professor at UCLA found an ingenious way to exploit the availability
bias. He asked different groups of students to list ways to improve the
course, and he varied the required number of improvements. As expected,
the students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher!
Perhaps the most interesting finding of this paradoxical research is that
the paradox is not always found: people sometimes go by content rather
than by ease of retrieval. The proof that you truly understand a pattern of
behavior is that you know how to reverse it. Schwarz and his colleagues
took on this challenge of discovering the conditions under which this
reversal would take place.
The ease with which instances of assertiveness come to the subject’s
mind changes during the task. The first few instances are easy, but
retrieval soon becomes much harder. Of course, the subject also expects
fluency to drop gradually, but the drop of fluency between six and twelve
instances appears to be steeper than the participant expected. The results
suggest that the participants make an inference: if I am having so much
more trouble than expected coming up with instances of my assertiveness,
then I can’t be very assertive. Note that this inference rests on a surprise—
fluency being worse than expected. The availability heuristic that the
subjects apply is better described as an “unexplained unavailability”
heuristic.
Schwarz and his colleagues reasoned that they could disrupt the
heuristic by providing the subjects with an explanation for the fluency of
retrieval that they experienced. They told the participants they would hear
background music while recalling instances and that the music would affect
performance in the memory task. Some subjects were told that the music
would help, others were told to expect diminished fluency. As predicted,
participants whose experience of fluency was “explained” did not use it as
a heuristic; the subjects who were told that music would make retrieval
more difficult rated themselves as equally assertive when they retrieved
twelve instances as when they retrieved six. Other cover stories have been
used with the same result: judgments are no longer influenced by ease of
retrieval when the experience of fluency is given a spurious explanation by
the presence of curved or straight text boxes, by the background color of
the screen, or by other irrelevant factors that the experimenters dreamed
up.
As I have described it, the process that leads to judgment by availability
appears to involve a complex chain of reasoning. The subjects have an
experience of diminishing fluency as they produce instances. They
evidently have expectations about the rate at which fluency decreases, and
those expectations are wrong: the difficulty of coming up with new
instances increases more rapidly than they expect. It is the unexpectedly
low fluency that causes people who were asked for twelve instances to
describe themselves as unassertive. When the surprise is eliminated, low
fluency no longer influences the judgment. The process appears to consist
of a sophisticatedriethe subj set of inferences. Is the automatic System 1
capable of it?
The answer is that in fact no complex reasoning is needed. Among the
basic features of System 1 is its ability to set expectations and to be
surprised when these expectations are violated. The system also retrieves
possible causes of a surprise, usually by finding a possible cause among
recent surprises. Furthermore, System 2 can reset the expectations of
System 1 on the fly, so that an event that would normally be surprising is
now almost normal. Suppose you are told that the three-year-old boy who
lives next door frequently wears a top hat in his stroller. You will be far less
surprised when you actually see him with his top hat than you would have
been without the warning. In Schwarz’s experiment, the background music
has been mentioned as a possible cause of retrieval problems. The
difficulty of retrieving twelve instances is no longer a surprise and therefore
is less likely to be evoked by the task of judging assertiveness.
Schwarz and his colleagues discovered that people who are personally
involved in the judgment are more likely to consider the number of
instances they retrieve from memory and less likely to go by fluency. They
recruited two groups of students for a study of risks to cardiac health. Half
the students had a family history of cardiac disease and were expected to
take the task more seriously than the others, who had no such history. All
were asked to recall either three or eight behaviors in their routine that
could affect their cardiac health (some were asked for risky behaviors,
others for protective behaviors). Students with no family history of heart
disease were casual about the task and followed the availability heuristic.
Students who found it difficult to find eight instances of risky behavior felt
themselves relatively safe, and those who struggled to retrieve examples of
safe behaviors felt themselves at risk. The students with a family history of
heart disease showed the opposite pattern—they felt safer when they
retrieved many instances of safe behavior and felt greater danger when
they retrieved many instances of risky behavior. They were also more likely
to feel that their future behavior would be affected by the experience of
evaluating their risk.
The conclusion is that the ease with which instances come to mind is a
System 1 heuristic, which is replaced by a focus on content when System 2
is more engaged. Multiple lines of evidence converge on the conclusion
that people who let themselves be guided by System 1 are more strongly
susceptible to availability biases than others who are in a state of higher
vigilance. The following are some conditions in which people “go with the
flow” and are affected more strongly by ease of retrieval than by the content
they retrieved:
 
when they are engaged in another effortful task at the same time
when they are in a good mood because they just thought of a happy
episode in their life
if they score low on a depression scale
if they are knowledgeable novices on the topic of the task, in contrast
to true experts
when they score high on a scale of faith in intuition
if they are (or are made to feel) powerful
I find the last finding particularly intriguing. The authors introduce their
article with a famous quote: “I don’t spend a lot of time taking polls around
the world to tell me what I think is the right way to act. I’ve just got to know
how I feel” (Georgee e the w W. Bush, November 2002). They go on to
show that reliance on intuition is only in part a personality trait. Merely
reminding people of a time when they had power increases their apparent
trust in their own intuition.
Speaking of Availability
“Because of the coincidence of two planes crashing last month,
she now prefers to take the train. That’s silly. The risk hasn’t really
changed; it is an availability bias.”
“He underestimates the risks of indoor pollution because there
are few media stories on them. That’s an availability effect. He
should look at the statistics.”
“She has been watching too many spy movies recently, so she’s
seeing conspiracies everywhere.”
“The CEO has had several successes in a row, so failure doesn’t
come easily to her mind. The availability bias is making her
overconfident.”
