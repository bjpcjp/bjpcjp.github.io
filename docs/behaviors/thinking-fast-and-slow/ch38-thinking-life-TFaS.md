Thinking About Life
Figure 16 is taken from an analysis by Andrew Clark, Ed Diener, and
Yannis Georgellis of the German Socio-Economic Panel, in which the
same respondents were asked every year about their satisfaction with
their life. Respondents also reported major changes that had occurred in
their circumstances during the preceding year. The graph shows the level
of satisfaction reported by people around the time they got married.
Figure 16
The graph reliably evokes nervous laughter from audiences, and the
nervousness is easy to understand: after all, people who decide to get
married do so either because they expect it will make them happier or
because they hope that making a tie permanent will maintain the present
state of bliss. In the useful term introduced by Daniel Gilbert and Timothy
Wilson, the decision to get married reflects, for many people, a massive
error of affective forecasting. On their wedding day, the bride and the
groom know that the rate of divorce is high and that the incidence of
marital disappointment is even higher, but they do not believe that these
statistics apply to them.
The startling news of figure 16 is the steep decline of life satisfaction.
The graph is commonly interpreted as tracing a process of adaptation, in
which the early joys of marriage quickly disappear as the experiences
become routine. However, another approach is possible, which focuses on
heuristics of judgment. Here we ask what happens in people’s minds when
j

they are asked to evaluate their life. The questions “How satisfied are you
with your life as a whole?” and “How happy are you these days?” are not as
simple as “What is your telephone number?” How do survey participants
manage to answer such questions in a few seconds, as all do? It will help
to think of this as another judgment. As is also the case for other questions,
some people may have a ready-made answer, which they had produced
on another occasion in which they evaluated their life. Others, probably the
majority, do not quickly find a response to the exact question they were
asked, and automatically make their task easier by substituting the answer
to another question. System 1 is at work. When we look at figure 16 in this
light, it takes on a different meaning.
The answers to many simple questions can be substituted for a global
evaluation of life. You remember the study in which students who had just
been asked how many dates they had in the previous month reported their
“happiness these days” as if dating was the only significant fact in their life.
In another well-known experiment in the same vein, Norbert Schwarz and
his colleagues invited subjects to the lab to complete a questionnaire on
life satisfaction. Before they began that task, however, he asked them to
photocopy a sheet of paper for him. Half the respondents found a dime on
the copying machine, planted there by the experimenter. The minor lucky
incident caused a marked improvement in subjects’ reported satisfaction
with their life as a whole! A mood heuristic is one way to answer life-
satisfaction questions.
The 
dating 
survey 
and 
the 
coin-on-the-machine 
experiment
demonstrated, as intended, that the responses to global well-being
questions should be taken with a grain of salt. But of course your current
mood is not the only thing that comes to mind when you are asked to
evaluate your life. You are likely to be reminded of significant events in your
recent past or near future; of recurrent concerns, such as the health JghtA5
alth Jght of a spouse or the bad company that your teenager keeps; of
important achievements and painful failures. A few ideas that are relevant
to the question will occur to you; many others will not. Even when it is not
influenced by completely irrelevant accidents such as the coin on the
machine, the score that you quickly assign to your life is determined by a
small sample of highly available ideas, not by a careful weighting of the
domains of your life.
People who recently married, or are expecting to marry in the near
future, are likely to retrieve that fact when asked a general question about
their life. Because marriage is almost always voluntary in the United
States, almost everyone who is reminded of his or her recent or
forthcoming marriage will be happy with the idea. Attention is the key to the
puzzle. Figure 16 can be read as a graph of the likelihood that people will
think of their recent or forthcoming marriage when asked about their life.
The salience of this thought is bound to diminish with the passage of time,
as its novelty wanes.
The figure shows an unusually high level of life satisfaction that lasts two
or three years around the event of marriage. However, if this apparent
surge reflects the time course of a heuristic for answering the question,
there is little we can learn from it about either happiness or about the
process of adaptation to marriage. We cannot infer from it that a tide of
raised happiness lasts for several years and gradually recedes. Even
people who are happy to be reminded of their marriage when asked a
question about their life are not necessarily happier the rest of the time.
Unless they think happy thoughts about their marriage during much of their
day, it will not directly influence their happiness. Even newlyweds who are
lucky enough to enjoy a state of happy preoccupation with their love will
eventually return to earth, and their experienced well-being will again
depend, as it does for the rest of us, on the environment and activities of
the present moment.
In the DRM studies, there was no overall difference in experienced well-
being between women who lived with a mate and women who did not. The
details of how the two groups used their time explained the finding.
Women who have a mate spend less time alone, but also much less time
with friends. They spend more time making love, which is wonderful, but
also more time doing housework, preparing food, and caring for children,
all relatively unpopular activities. And of course, the large amount of time
married women spend with their husband is much more pleasant for some
than for others. Experienced well-being is on average unaffected by
marriage, not because marriage makes no difference to happiness but
because it changes some aspects of life for the better and others for the
worse.
One reason for the low correlations between individuals’ circumstances
and their satisfaction with life is that both experienced happiness and life
satisfaction are largely determined by the genetics of temperament. A
disposition for well-being is as heritable as height or intelligence, as
demonstrated by studies of twins separated at birth. People who appear
equally fortunate vary greatly in how happy they are. In some instances, as
in the case of marriage, the correlations with well-being are low because of
balancing effects. The same situation may be good for some people and
bad for others, and new circumstances have both benefits and costs. In
other cases, such as high income, the effects on life satisfaction are
generally positive, but the picture is complicated by the fact that some
people care much more about money than others do.
A large-scale study of the impact of higher education, which was
conducted for JghtA5 aor Jghtanother purpose, revealed striking evidence
of the lifelong effects of the goals that young people set for themselves.
The relevant data were drawn from questionnaires collected in 1995–1997
from approximately 12,000 people who had started their higher education
in elite schools in 1976. When they were 17 or 18, the participants had
filled out a questionnaire in which they rated the goal of “being very well-off
financially” on a 4-point scale ranging from “not important” to “essential.”
The questionnaire they completed twenty years later included measures of
their income in 1995, as well as a global measure of life satisfaction.
Goals make a large difference. Nineteen years after they stated their
financial aspirations, many of the people who wanted a high income had
achieved it. Among the 597 physicians and other medical professionals in
the sample, for example, each additional point on the money-importance
scale was associated with an increment of over $14,000 of job income in
1995 dollars! Nonworking married women were also likely to have
satisfied their financial ambitions. Each point on the scale translated into
more than $12,000 of added household income for these women, evidently
through the earnings of their spouse.
The importance that people attached to income at age 18 also
anticipated their satisfaction with their income as adults. We compared life
satisfaction in a high-income group (more than $200,000 household
income) to a low- to moderate-income group (less than $50,000). The
effect of income on life satisfaction was larger for those who had listed
being well-off financially as an essential goal: .57 point on a 5-point scale.
The corresponding difference for those who had indicated that money was
not important was only .12. The people who wanted money and got it were
significantly more satisfied than average; those who wanted money and
didn’t get it were significantly more dissatisfied. The same principle
applies to other goals—one recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting
goals that are especially difficult to attain. Measured by life satisfaction 20
years later, the least promising goal that a young person could have was
“becoming accomplished in a performing art.” Teenagers’ goals influence
what happens to them, where they end up, and how satisfied they are.
In part because of these findings I have changed my mind about the
definition of well-being. The goals that people set for themselves are so
important to what they do and how they feel about it that an exclusive focus
on experienced well-being is not tenable. We cannot hold a concept of
well-being that ignores what people want. On the other hand, it is also true
that a concept of well-being that ignores how people feel as they live and
focuses only on how they feel when they think about their life is also
untenable. We must accept the complexities of a hybrid view, in which the
well-being of both selves is considered.
The Focusing Illusion
We can infer from the speed with which people respond to questions about
their life, and from the effects of current mood on their responses, that they
do not engage in a careful examination when they evaluate their life. They
must be using heuristics, which are examples of both substitution and
WYSIATI. Although their view of their life was influenced by a question
about dating or by a coin on the copying machine, the participants in these
studies did not forget that there is more to life than dating or feeling lucky.
The concept of happiness is not suddenly changed by finding a dime, but
System 1 readily substitutes a small part of it for the whole of it. Any aspect
of life to which attention is directed will loom JghtA5 aoom Jght large in a
global evaluation. This is the essence of the focusing illusion, which can
be described in a single sentence:
Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are
thinking about it.
The origin of this idea was a family debate about moving from California to
Princeton, in which my wife claimed that people are happier in California
than on the East Coast. I argued that climate is demonstrably not an
important determinant of well-being—the Scandinavian countries are
probably the happiest in the world. I observed that permanent life
circumstances have little effect on well-being and tried in vain to convince
my wife that her intuitions about the happiness of Californians were an
error of affective forecasting.
A short time later, with this debate still on my mind, I participated in a
workshop about the social science of global warming. A colleague made
an argument that was based on his view of the well-being of the population
of planet Earth in the next century. I argued that it was preposterous to
forecast what it would be like to live on a warmer planet when we did not
even know what it is like to live in California. Soon after that exchange, my
colleague David Schkade and I were granted research funds to study two
questions: Are people who live in California happier than others? and
What are the popular beliefs about the relative happiness of Californians?
We recruited large samples of students at major state universities in
California, Ohio, and Michigan. From some of them we obtained a
,
,
g
detailed report of their satisfaction with various aspects of their lives. From
others we obtained a prediction of how someone “with your interests and
values” who lived elsewhere would complete the same questionnaire.
As we analyzed the data, it became obvious that I had won the family
argument. As expected, the students in the two regions differed greatly in
their attitude to their climate: the Californians enjoyed their climate and the
Midwesterners despised theirs. But climate was not an important
determinant of well-being. Indeed, there was no difference whatsoever
between the life satisfaction of students in California and in the Midwest.
We also found that my wife was not alone in her belief that Californians
enjoy greater well-being than others. The students in both regions shared
the same mistaken view, and we were able to trace their error to an
exaggerated belief in the importance of climate. We described the error as
a focusing illusion.
The essence of the focusing illusion is WYSIATI, giving too much weight
to the climate, too little to all the other determinants of well-being. To
appreciate how strong this illusion is, take a few seconds to consider the
question:
How much pleasure do you get from your car?
An answer came to your mind immediately; you know how much you like
and enjoy your car. Now examine a different question: “When do you get
pleasure from your car?” The answer to this question may surprise you, but
it is straightforward: you get pleasure (or displeasure) from your car when
you think about your car, which is probably not very often. Under normal
circumstances, you do not spend much time thinking about your car when
you are driving it. You think of other things as you drive, and your mood is
determined by whatever you think about. Here again, when you tried to rate
how much you enjoyed your car, you actually answered JghtA5 aed Jghta
much narrower question: “How much pleasure do you get from your car
when you think about it?” The substitution caused you to ignore the fact
that you rarely think about your car, a form of duration neglect. The upshot
is a focusing illusion. If you like your car, you are likely to exaggerate the
pleasure you derive from it, which will mislead you when you think of the
virtues of your current vehicle as well as when you contemplate buying a
new one.
A similar bias distorts judgments of the happiness of Californians. When
asked about the happiness of Californians, you probably conjure an image
of someone attending to a distinctive aspect of the California experience,
such as hiking in the summer or admiring the mild winter weather. The
focusing illusion arises because Californians actually spend little time
attending to these aspects of their life. Moreover, long-term Californians
are unlikely to be reminded of the climate when asked for a global
evaluation of their life. If you have been there all your life and do not travel
much, living in California is like having ten toes: nice, but not something
one thinks much about. Thoughts of any aspect of life are more likely to be
salient if a contrasting alternative is highly available.
People who recently moved to California will respond differently.
Consider an enterprising soul who moved from Ohio to seek happiness in
a better climate. For a few years following the move, a question about his
satisfaction with life will probably remind him of the move and also evoke
thoughts of the contrasting climates in the two states. The comparison will
surely favor California, and the attention to that aspect of life may distort its
true weight in experience. However, the focusing illusion can also bring
comfort. Whether or not the individual is actually happier after the move, he
will report himself happier, because thoughts of the climate will make him
believe that he is. The focusing illusion can cause people to be wrong
about their present state of well-being as well as about the happiness of
others, and about their own happiness in the future.
What proportion of the day do paraplegics spend in a bad
mood?
This question almost certainly made you think of a paraplegic who is
currently thinking about some aspect of his condition. Your guess about a
paraplegic’s mood is therefore likely to be accurate in the early days after
a crippling accident; for some time after the event, accident victims think of
little else. But over time, with few exceptions, attention is withdrawn from a
new situation as it becomes more familiar. The main exceptions are
chronic pain, constant exposure to loud noise, and severe depression.
Pain and noise are biologically set to be signals that attract attention, and
depression involves a self-reinforcing cycle of miserable thoughts. There is
therefore no adaptation to these conditions. Paraplegia, however, is not
one of the exceptions: detailed observations show that paraplegics are in
a fairly good mood more than half of the time as early as one month
following their accident—though their mood is certainly somber when they
think about their situation. Most of the time, however, paraplegics work,
read, enjoy jokes and friends, and get angry when they read about politics
in the newspaper. When they are involved in any of these activities, they
are not much different from anyone else, and we can expect the
experienced well-being of paraplegics to be near normal much of the time.
Adaptation to a new situation, whether good or bad, consists in large part
of thinking less and less about it. In that sense, most long-term
circumstances of life, including paraplegia and marriage, are part-time
states that one inhabits only when one at JghtA5 a at Jghttends to them.
One of the privileges of teaching at Princeton is the opportunity to guide
bright undergraduates through a research thesis. And one of my favorite
experiences in this vein was a project in which Beruria Cohn collected and
analyzed data from a survey firm that asked respondents to estimate the
proportion of time that paraplegics spend in a bad mood. She split her
respondents into two groups: some were told that the crippling accident
had occurred a month earlier, some a year earlier. In addition, each
respondent indicated whether he or she knew a paraplegic personally. The
two groups agreed closely in their judgment about the recent paraplegics:
those who knew a paraplegic estimated 75% bad mood; those who had to
imagine a paraplegic said 70%. In contrast, the two groups differed
sharply in their estimates of the mood of paraplegics a year after the
accidents: those who knew a paraplegic offered 41% as their estimate of
the time in that bad mood. The estimates of those who were not personally
acquainted with a paraplegic averaged 68%. Evidently, those who knew a
paraplegic had observed the gradual withdrawal of attention from the
condition, but others did not forecast that this adaptation would occur.
Judgments about the mood of lottery winners one month and one year after
the event showed exactly the same pattern.
We can expect the life satisfaction of paraplegics and those afflicted by
other chronic and burdensome conditions to be low relative to their
experienced well-being, because the request to evaluate their lives will
inevitably remind them of the life of others and of the life they used to lead.
Consistent with this idea, recent studies of colostomy patients have
produced dramatic inconsistencies between the patients’ ex
