The Endowment Effect
You have probably seen figure 11 or a close cousin of it even if you never
had a class in economics. The graph displays an individual’s “indifference
map” for two goods.
Figure 11
Students learn in introductory economics classes that each point on the
map specifies a particular combination of income and vacation days. Each
“indifference curve” connects the combinations of the two goods that are
equally desirable—they have the same utility. The curves would turn into
parallel straight lines if people were willing to “sell” vacation days for extra
income at the same price regardless of how much income and how much
vacation time they have. The convex shape indicates diminishing marginal
utility: the more leisure you have, the less you care for an extra day of it,
and each added day is worth less than the one before. Similarly, the more
income you have, the less you care for an extra dollar, and the amount you
are willing to give up for an extra day of leisure increases.
All locations on an indifference curve are equally attractive. This is
literally what indifference means: you don’t care where you are on an
indifference curve. So if A and B are on the same indifference curve for
you, you are indifferent between them and will need no incentive to move
from one to the other, or back. Some version of this figure has appeared in
every economics textbook written in the last hundred years, and many
millions of students have stared at it. Few have noticed what is missing.
Here again, the power and elegance of a theoretical model have blinded
students and scholars to a serious deficiency.
What is missing from the figure is an indication of the individual’s current
income and leisure. If you are a salaried employee, the terms of your
employment specify a salary and a number of vacation days, which is a
point on the map. This is your reference point, your status quo, but the
figure does not show it. By failing to display it, the theorists who draw this
figure invite you to believe that the reference point does not matter, but by
now you know that of course it does. This is Bernoulli’s error all over again.
The representation of indifference curves implicitly assumes that your utility
at any given moment is determined entirely by your present situation, that
the past is irrelevant, and that your evaluation of a possible job does not
depend on the terms of your current job. These assumptions are
completely unrealistic in this case and in many others.
The omission of the ref Con serence point from the indifference map is a
surprising case of theory-induced blindness, because we so often
encounter cases in which the reference point obviously matters. In labor
negotiations, it is well understood by both sides that the reference point is
the existing contract and that the negotiations will focus on mutual
demands for concessions relative to that reference point. The role of loss
aversion in bargaining is also well understood: making concessions hurts.
You have much personal experience of the role of reference point. If you
changed jobs or locations, or even considered such a change, you surely
remember that the features of the new place were coded as pluses or
minuses relative to where you were. You may also have noticed that
disadvantages loomed larger than advantages in this evaluation—loss
aversion was at work. It is difficult to accept changes for the worse. For
example, the minimal wage that unemployed workers would accept for new
employment averages 90% of their previous wage, and it drops by less
than 10% over a period of one year.
To appreciate the power that the reference point exerts on choices,
consider Albert and Ben, “hedonic twins” who have identical tastes and
currently hold identical starting jobs, with little income and little leisure time.
Their current circumstances correspond to the point marked 1 in figure 11.
The firm offers them two improved positions, A and B, and lets them
decide who will get a raise of $10,000 (position A) and who will get an
extra day of paid vacation each month (position B). As they are both
indifferent, they toss a coin. Albert gets the raise, Ben gets the extra
leisure. Some time passes as the twins get accustomed to their positions.
Now the company suggests they may switch jobs if they wish.
The standard theory represented in the figure assumes that preferences
are stable over time. Positions A and B are equally attractive for both twins
and they will need little or no incentive to switch. In sharp contrast, prospect
theory asserts that both twins will definitely prefer to remain as they are.
This preference for the status quo is a consequence of loss aversion.
Let us focus on Albert. He was initially in position 1 on the graph, and
from that reference point he found these two alternatives equally attractive:
Go to A: a raise of $10,000
OR
Go to B: 12 extra days of vacation
Taking position A changes Albert’s reference point, and when he
considers switching to B, his choice has a new structure:
Stay at A: no gain and no loss
OR
Move to B: 12 extra days of vacation and a $10,000 salary cut
You just had the subjective experience of loss aversion. You could feel it: a
salary cut of $10,000 is very bad news. Even if a gain of 12 vacation days
was as impressive as a gain of $10,000, the same improvement of leisure
is not sufficient to compensate for a loss of $10,000. Albert will stay at A
because the disadvantage of moving outweighs the advantage. The same
reasoning applies to Ben, who will also want to keep his present job
because the loss of now-precious leisure outweighs the benefit of the extra
income.
This example highlights two aspects of choice that the st Bon s Ae st
Bonandard model of indifference curves does not predict. First, tastes are
not fixed; they vary with the reference point. Second, the disadvantages of
a change loom larger than its advantages, inducing a bias that favors the
status quo. Of course, loss aversion does not imply that you never prefer to
change your situation; the benefits of an opportunity may exceed even
overweighted losses. Loss aversion implies only that choices are strongly
biased in favor of the reference situation (and generally biased to favor
small rather than large changes).
Conventional indifference maps and Bernoulli’s representation of
outcomes as states of wealth share a mistaken assumption: that your utility
for a state of affairs depends only on that state and is not affected by your
history. Correcting that mistake has been one of the achievements of
behavioral economics.
The Endowment Effect
The question of when an approach or a movement got its start is often
difficult to answer, but the origin of what is now known as behavioral
economics can be specified precisely. In the early 1970s, Richard Thaler,
then a graduate student in the very conservative economics department of
the University of Rochester, began having heretical thoughts. Thaler always
had a sharp wit and an ironic bent, and as a student he amused himself by
collecting observations of behavior that the model of rational economic
behavior could not explain. He took special pleasure in evidence of
economic irrationality among his professors, and he found one that was
particularly striking.
Professor R (now revealed to be Richard Rosett, who went on to
become the dean of the University of Chicago Graduate School of
Business) was a firm believer in standard economic theory as well as a
sophisticated wine lover. Thaler observed that Professor R was very
reluctant to sell a bottle from his collection—even at the high price of $100
(in 1975 dollars!). Professor R bought wine at auctions, but would never
pay more than $35 for a bottle of that quality. At prices between $35 and
$100, he would neither buy nor sell. The large gap is inconsistent with
economic theory, in which the professor is expected to have a single value
for the bottle. If a particular bottle is worth $50 to him, then he should be
willing to sell it for any amount in excess of $50. If he did not own the bottle,
he should be willing to pay any amount up to $50 for it. The just-acceptable
selling price and the just-acceptable buying price should have been
identical, but in fact the minimum price to sell ($100) was much higher than
the maximum buying price of $35. Owning the good appeared to increase
its value.
Richard Thaler found many examples of what he called the endowment
effect, especially for goods that are not regularly traded. You can easily
imagine yourself in a similar situation. Suppose you hold a ticket to a sold-
out concert by a popular band, which you bought at the regular price of
$200. You are an avid fan and would have been willing to pay up to $500
for the ticket. Now you have your ticket and you learn on the Internet that
richer or more desperate fans are offering $3,000. Would you sell? If you
resemble most of the audience at sold-out events you do not sell. Your
lowest selling price is above $3,000 and your maximum buying price is
$500. This is an example of an endowment effect, and a believer in
standard economic theory would be puzzled by it. Thaler was looking for an
account that could explain puzzles of this kind.
Chance intervened when Thaler met one of our former students at a
conference and obtained an early draft of prospect theory. He reports that
he read the manuscript with considerable Bon s Able Bonexcitement,
because he quickly realized that the loss-averse value function of prospect
theory could explain the endowment effect and some other puzzles in his
collection. The solution was to abandon the standard idea that Professor R
had a unique utility for the state of having a particular bottle. Prospect
theory suggested that the willingness to buy or sell the bottle depends on
the reference point—whether or not the professor owns the bottle now. If he
owns it, he considers the pain of giving up the bottle. If he does not own it,
he considers the pleasure of getting the bottle. The values were unequal
because of loss aversion: giving up a bottle of nice wine is more painful
than getting an equally good bottle is pleasurable. Remember the graph of
losses and gains in the previous chapter. The slope of the function is
steeper in the negative domain; the response to a loss is stronger than the
response to a corresponding gain. This was the explanation of the
endowment effect that Thaler had been searching for. And the first
application of prospect theory to an economic puzzle now appears to have
been a significant milestone in the development of behavioral economics.
Thaler arranged to spend a year at Stanford when he knew that Amos
and I would be there. During this productive period, we learned much from
each other and became friends. Seven years later, he and I had another
opportunity to spend a year together and to continue the conversation
between psychology and economics. The Russell Sage Foundation, which
was for a long time the main sponsor of behavioral economics, gave one
of its first grants to Thaler for the purpose of spending a year with me in
Vancouver. During that year, we worked closely with a local economist,
Jack Knetsch, with whom we shared intense interest in the endowment
effect, the rules of economic fairness, and spicy Chinese food.
The starting point for our investigation was that the endowment effect is
not universal. If someone asks you to change a $5 bill for five singles, you
hand over the five ones without any sense of loss. Nor is there much loss
aversion when you shop for shoes. The merchant who gives up the shoes
in exchange for money certainly feels no loss. Indeed, the shoes that he
hands over have always been, from his point of view, a cumbersome proxy
for money that he was hoping to collect from some consumer. Furthermore,
you probably do not experience paying the merchant as a loss, because
you were effectively holding money as a proxy for the shoes you intended
to buy. These cases of routine trading are not essentially different from the
exchange of a $5 bill for five singles. There is no loss aversion on either
side of routine commercial exchanges.
What distinguishes these market transactions from Professor R’s
reluctance to sell his wine, or the reluctance of Super Bowl ticket holders to
sell even at a very high price? The distinctive feature is that both the shoes
the merchant sells you and the money you spend from your budget for
shoes are held “for exchange.” They are intended to be traded for other
goods. Other goods, such as wine and Super Bowl tickets, are held “for
use,” to be consumed or otherwise enjoyed. Your leisure time and the
standard of living that your income supports are also not intended for sale
or exchange.
Knetsch, Thaler, and I set out to design an experiment that would
highlight the contrast between goods that are held for use and for
exchange. We borrowed one aspect of the design of our experiment from
Vernon Smith, the founder of experimental economics, with whom I would
share a Nobel Prize many years later. In this method, a limited number of
tokens are distributed to the participants in a “market.” Any participants
who own a token at the end Bon s A end Bon of the experiment can
redeem it for cash. The redemption values differ for different individuals, to
represent the fact that the goods traded in markets are more valuable to
some people than to others. The same token may be worth $10 to you and
$20 to me, and an exchange at any price between these values will be
advantageous to both of us.
Smith created vivid demonstrations of how well the basic mechanisms
of supply and demand work. Individuals would make successive public
offers to buy or sell a token, and others would respond publicly to the offer.
Everyone watches these exchanges and sees the price at which the
tokens change hands. The results are as regular as those of a
demonstration in physics. As inevitably as water flows downhill, those who
own a token that is of little value to them (because their redemption values
are low) end up selling their token at a profit to someone who values it
more. When trading ends, the tokens are in the hands of those who can get
the most money for them from the experimenter. The magic of the markets
has worked! Furthermore, economic theory correctly predicts both the final
price at which the market will settle and the number of tokens that will
change hands. If half the participants in the market were randomly
assigned tokens, the theory predicts that half of the tokens will change
hands.
We used a variation on Smith’s method for our experiment. Each
session began with several rounds of trades for tokens, which perfectly
replicated Smith’s finding. The estimated number of trades was typically
very close or identical to the amount predicted by the standard theory. The
tokens, of course, had value only because they could be exchanged for the
experimenter’s cash; they had no value for use. Then we conducted a
similar market for an object that we expected people to value for use: an
attractive coffee mug, decorated with the university insignia of wherever we
were conducting the experiments. The mug was then worth about $6 (and
would be worth about double that amount today). Mugs were distributed
randomly to half the participants. The Sellers had their mug in front of them,
and the Buyers were invited to look at their neighbor’s mug; all indicated
the price at which they would trade. The Buyers had to use their own
money to acquire a mug. The results were dramatic: the average selling
price was about double the average buying price, and the estimated
number of trades was less than half of the number predicted by standard
theory. The magic of the market did not work for a good that the owners
expected to use.
We conducted a series of experiments using variants of the same
procedure, always with the same results. My favorite is one in which we
added to the Sellers and Buyers a third group—Choosers. Unlike the
Buyers, who had to spend their own money to acquire the good, the
Choosers could receive either a mug or a sum of money, and they
indicated the amount of money that was as desirable as receiving the
good. These were the results:
Sellers
$7.12
Choosers $3.12
Buyers
$2.87
The gap between Sellers and Choosers is remarkable, because they
actually face the same choice! If you are a Seller you can go home with
either a m Bon s A a m Bonug or money, and if you are a Chooser you
have exactly the same two options. The long-term effects of the decision
are identical for the two groups. The only difference is in the emotion of the
moment. The high price that Sellers set reflects the reluctance to give up
an object that they already own, a reluctance that can be seen in babies
who hold on fiercely to a toy and show great agitation when it is taken
away. Loss aversion is built into the automatic evaluations of System 1.
Buyers and Choosers set similar cash values, although the Buyers have
to pay for the mug, which is free for the Choosers. This is what we would
expect if Buyers do not experience spending money on the mug as a loss.
Evidence from brain imaging confirms the difference. Selling goods that
one would normally use activates regions of the brain that are associated
with disgust and pain. Buying also activates these areas, but only when the
prices are perceived as too high—when you feel that a seller is taking
money that exceeds the exchange value. Brain recordings also indicate
that buying at especially low prices is a pleasurable event.
The cash value that the Sellers set on the mug is a bit more than twice
as high as the value set by Choosers and Buyers. The ratio is very close to
the loss aversion coefficient in risky choice, as we might expect if the
same value function for gains and losses of money is applied to both
riskless and risky decisions. A ratio of about 2:1 has appeared in studies
of diverse economic domains, including the response of households to
price changes. As economists would predict, customers tend to increase
their purchases of eggs, orange juice, or fish when prices drop and to
reduce their purchases when prices rise; however, in contrast to the
predictions of economic theory, the effect of price increases (losses
relative to the reference price) is about twice as large as the effect of
gains.
The mugs experiment has remained the standard demonstration of the
endowment effect, along with an even simpler experiment that Jack
Knetsch reported at about the same time. Knetsch asked two classes to fill
out a questionnaire and rewarded them with a gift that remained in front of
them for the duration of the experiment. In one session, the prize was an
expensive pen; in another, a bar of Swiss chocolate. At the end of the
class, the experimenter showed the alternative gift and allowed everyone
to trade his or her gift for another. Only about 10% of the participants opted
to exchange their gift. Most of those who had received the pen stayed with
the pen, and those who had received the chocolate did not budge either.
Thinking Like a Trader
The fundamental ideas of prospect theory are that reference points exist,
and that losses loom larger than corresponding gains. Observations in real
markets collected over the years illustrate the power of these concepts. A
study of the market for condo apartments in Boston during a downturn
yielded particularly clear results. The authors of that study compared the
behavior of owners of similar units who had bought their dwellings at
different prices. For a rational agent, the buying price is irrelevant history—
the current market value is all that matters. Not so for Humans in a down
market for housing. Owners who have a high reference point and thus face
higher losses set a higher price on their dwelling, spend a longer time
trying to sell their home, and eventually receive more money.
The original demonstration of an asymmetry between selling prices and
buying pri
