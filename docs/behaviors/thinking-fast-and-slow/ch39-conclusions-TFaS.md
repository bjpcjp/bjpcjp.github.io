Conclusions
I began this book by introducing two fictitious characters, spent some time
discussing two species, and ended with two selves. The two characters
were the intuitive System 1, which does JghtA5 ` J5 the fast thinking, and
the effortful and slower System 2, which does the slow thinking, monitors
System 1, and maintains control as best it can within its limited resources.
The two species were the fictitious Econs, who live in the land of theory,
and the Humans, who act in the real world. The two selves are the
experiencing self, which does the living, and the remembering self, which
keeps score and makes the choices. In this final chapter I consider some
applications of the three distinctions, taking them in reverse order.
Two Selves
The possibility of conflicts between the remembering self and the interests
of the experiencing self turned out to be a harder problem than I initially
thought. In an early experiment, the cold-hand study, the combination of
duration neglect and the peak-end rule led to choices that were manifestly
absurd. Why would people willingly expose themselves to unnecessary
pain? Our subjects left the choice to their remembering self, preferring to
repeat the trial that left the better memory, although it involved more pain.
Choosing by the quality of the memory may be justified in extreme cases,
for example when post-traumatic stress is a possibility, but the cold-hand
experience was not traumatic. An objective observer making the choice for
someone else would undoubtedly choose the short exposure, favoring the
sufferer’s experiencing self. The choices that people made on their own
behalf are fairly described as mistakes. Duration neglect and the peak-end
rule in the evaluation of stories, both at the opera and in judgments of Jen’s
life, are equally indefensible. It does not make sense to evaluate an entire
life by its last moments, or to give no weight to duration in deciding which
life is more desirable.
The remembering self is a construction of System 2. However, the
distinctive features of the way it evaluates episodes and lives are
characteristics of our memory. Duration neglect and the peak-end rule
originate in System 1 and do not necessarily correspond to the values of
System 2. We believe that duration is important, but our memory tells us it
is not. The rules that govern the evaluation of the past are poor guides for
decision making, because time does matter. The central fact of our
g,
existence is that time is the ultimate finite resource, but the remembering
self ignores that reality. The neglect of duration combined with the peak-
end rule causes a bias that favors a short period of intense joy over a long
period of moderate happiness. The mirror image of the same bias makes
us fear a short period of intense but tolerable suffering more than we fear a
much longer period of moderate pain. Duration neglect also makes us
prone to accept a long period of mild unpleasantness because the end will
be better, and it favors giving up an opportunity for a long happy period if it
is likely to have a poor ending. To drive the same idea to the point of
discomfort, consider the common admonition, “Don’t do it, you will regret
it.” The advice sounds wise because anticipated regret is the verdict of the
remembering self and we are inclined to accept such judgments as final
and conclusive. We should not forget, however, that the perspective of the
remembering self is not always correct. An objective observer of the
hedonimeter profile, with the interests of the experiencing self in mind,
might well offer different advice. The remembering self’s neglect of
duration, its exaggerated emphasis on peaks and ends, and its
susceptibility to hindsight combine to yield distorted reflections of our
actual experience.
In contrast, the duration-weighted conception of well-being treats all
moments of life alike, memorable or not. Some moments end up weighted
more than others, either because they are memorable Sareeva or
because they are important. The time that people spend dwelling on a
memorable moment should be included in its duration, adding to its
weight. A moment can also gain importance by altering the experience of
subsequent moments. For example, an hour spent practicing the violin may
enhance the experience of many hours of playing or listening to music
years later. Similarly, a brief awful event that causes PTSD should be
weighted by the total duration of the long-term misery it causes. In the
duration-weighted perspective, we can determine only after the fact that a
moment is memorable or meaningful. The statements “I will always
remember…” or “this is a meaningful moment” should be taken as
promises or predictions, which can be false—and often are—even when
uttered with complete sincerity. It is a good bet that many of the things we
say we will always remember will be long forgotten ten years later.
The logic of duration weighting is compelling, but it cannot be
considered a complete theory of well-being because individuals identify
with their remembering self and care about their story. A theory of well-
being that ignores what people want cannot be sustained. On the other
hand, a theory that ignores what actually happens in people’s lives and
focuses exclusively on what they think about their life is not tenable either.
The remembering self and the experiencing self must both be considered,
because their interests do not always coincide. Philosophers could
struggle with these questions for a long time.
The issue of which of the two selves matters more is not a question only
for philosophers; it has implications for policies in several domains,
notably medicine and welfare. Consider the investment that should be
made in the treatment of various medical conditions, including blindness,
deafness, or kidney failure. Should the investments be determined by how
much people fear these conditions? Should investments be guided by the
suffering that patients actually experience? Or should they follow the
intensity of the patients’ desire to be relieved from their condition and by
the sacrifices that they would be willing to make to achieve that relief? The
ranking of blindness and deafness, or of colostomy and dialysis, might well
be different depending on which measure of the severity of suffering is
used. No easy solution is in sight, but the issue is too important to be
ignored.
The possibility of using measures of well-being as indicators to guide
government policies has attracted considerable recent interest, both
among academics and in several governments in Europe. It is now
conceivable, as it was not even a few years ago, that an index of the
amount of suffering in society will someday be included in national
statistics, along with measures of unemployment, physical disability, and
income. This project has come a long way.
Econs and Humans
In everyday speech, we call people reasonable if it is possible to reason
with them, if their beliefs are generally in tune with reality, and if their
preferences are in line with their interests and their values. The word
rational conveys an image of greater deliberation, more calculation, and
less warmth, but in common language a rational person is certainly
reasonable. For economists and decision theorists, the adjective has an
altogether different meaning. The only test of rationality is not whether a
person’s beliefs and preferences are reasonable, but whether they are
internally consistent. A rational person can believe in ghosts so long as all
her other beliefs are consistent with the existence of ghosts. A rational
person can prefer being hated over being loved, so long as hi Sso as alls
preferences are consistent. Rationality is logical coherence—reasonable
or not. Econs are rational by this definition, but there is overwhelming
evidence that Humans cannot be. An Econ would not be susceptible to
priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, the inside view, or preference
reversals, which Humans cannot consistently avoid.
The definition of rationality as coherence is impossibly restrictive; it
demands adherence to rules of logic that a finite mind is not able to
implement. Reasonable people cannot be rational by that definition, but
they should not be branded as irrational for that reason. Irrational is a
strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn
resistance to reasonable argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos
is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in
fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the
rational-agent model.
Although Humans are not irrational, they often need help to make more
accurate judgments and better decisions, and in some cases policies and
institutions can provide that help. These claims may seem innocuous, but
they are in fact quite controversial. As interpreted by the important Chicago
school of economics, faith in human rationality is closely linked to an
ideology in which it is unnecessary and even immoral to protect people
against their choices. Rational people should be free, and they should be
responsible for taking care of themselves. Milton Friedman, the leading
figure in that school, expressed this view in the title of one of his popular
books: Free to Choose.
The assumption that agents are rational provides the intellectual
foundation for the libertarian approach to public policy: do not interfere with
the individual’s right to choose, unless the choices harm others. Libertarian
policies are further bolstered by admiration for the efficiency of markets in
allocating goods to the people who are willing to pay the most for them. A
famous example of the Chicago approach is titled A Theory of Rational
Addiction; it explains how a rational agent with a strong preference for
intense and immediate gratification may make the rational decision to
accept future addiction as a consequence. I once heard Gary Becker, one
of the authors of that article, who is also a Nobel laureate of the Chicago
school, argue in a lighter vein, but not entirely as a joke, that we should
consider the possibility of explaining the so-called obesity epidemic by
people’s belief that a cure for diabetes will soon become available. He
was making a valuable point: when we observe people acting in ways that
seem odd, we should first examine the possibility that they have a good
reason to do what they do. Psychological interpretations should only be
invoked when the reasons become implausible—which Becker’s
explanation of obesity probably is.
In a nation of Econs, government should keep out of the way, allowing
the Econs to act as they choose, so long as they do not harm others. If a
motorcycle rider chooses to ride without a helmet, a libertarian will support
his right to do so. Citizens know what they are doing, even when they
choose not to save for their old age, or when they expose themselves to
addictive substances. There is sometimes a hard edge to this position:
elderly people who did not save enough for retirement get little more
sympathy than someone who complains about the bill after consuming a
large meal at a restaurant. Much is therefore at stake in the debate
between the Chicago school and the behavioral economists, who reject
the extreme form of the rational-agent model. Freedom is not a contested
value; all the participants in the debate are in favor of it. But life is more
complex for behavioral economists than for tru S th17;e believers in human
rationality. No behavioral economist favors a state that will force its citizens
to eat a balanced diet and to watch only television programs that are good
for the soul. For behavioral economists, however, freedom has a cost,
which is borne by individuals who make bad choices, and by a society that
feels obligated to help them. The decision of whether or not to protect
individuals against their mistakes therefore presents a dilemma for
behavioral economists. The economists of the Chicago school do not face
that problem, because rational agents do not make mistakes. For
adherents of this school, freedom is free of charge.
In 2008 the economist Richard Thaler and the jurist Cass Sunstein
teamed up to write a book, Nudge, which quickly became an international
bestseller and the bible of behavioral economics. Their book introduced
several new words into the language, including Econs and Humans. It also
presented a set of solutions to the dilemma of how to help people make
good decisions without curtailing their freedom. Thaler and Sunstein
advocate a position of libertarian paternalism, in which the state and other
institutions are allowed to nudge people to make decisions that serve their
own long-term interests. The designation of joining a pension plan as the
default option is an example of a nudge. It is difficult to argue that anyone’s
freedom is diminished by being automatically enrolled in the plan, when
they merely have to check a box to opt out. As we saw earlier, the framing
of the individual’s decision—Thaler and Sunstein call it choice architecture
—has a huge effect on the outcome. The nudge is based on sound
psychology, which I described earlier. The default option is naturally
perceived as the normal choice. Deviating from the normal choice is an act
of commission, which requires more effortful deliberation, takes on more
responsibility, and is more likely to evoke regret than doing nothing. These
are powerful forces that may guide the decision of someone who is
otherwise unsure of what to do.
Humans, more than Econs, also need protection from others who
deliberately exploit their weaknesses—and especially the quirks of System
1 and the laziness of System 2. Rational agents are assumed to make
important decisions carefully, and to use all the information that is provided
to them. An Econ will read and understand the fine print of a contract
before signing it, but Humans usually do not. An unscrupulous firm that
designs contracts that customers will routinely sign without reading has
considerable legal leeway in hiding important information in plain sight. A
pernicious implication of the rational-agent model in its extreme form is
that customers are assumed to need no protection beyond ensuring that
the relevant information is disclosed. The size of the print and the
complexity of the language in the disclosure are not considered relevant—
an Econ knows how to deal with small print when it matters. In contrast, the
recommendations of Nudge require firms to offer contracts that are
sufficiently simple to be read and understood by Human customers. It is a
good sign that some of these recommendations have encountered
significant opposition from firms whose profits might suffer if their
customers were better informed. A world in which firms compete by
offering better products is preferable to one in which the winner is the firm
that is best at obfuscation.
A remarkable feature of libertarian paternalism is its appeal across a
broad political spectrum. The flagship example of behavioral policy, called
Save More Tomorrow, was sponsored in Congress by an unusual coalition
that included extreme conservatives as well as liberals. Save More
Tomorrow is a financial plan that firms can offer their employees. Those
who sign on allow the employer to increa Syers liberalse their contribution
to their saving plan by a fixed proportion whenever they receive a raise.
The increased saving rate is implemented automatically until the employee
gives notice that she wants to opt out of it. This brilliant innovation,
proposed by Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi in 2003, has now
improved the savings rate and brightened the future prospects of millions
of workers. It is soundly based in the psychological principles that readers
of this book will recognize. It avoids the resistance to an immediate loss by
requiring no immediate change; by tying increased saving to pay raises, it
turns losses into foregone gains, which are much easier to bear; and the
feature of automaticity aligns the laziness of System 2 with the long-term
interests of the workers. All this, of course, without compelling anyone to do
anything he does not wish to do and without any misdirection or artifice.
The appeal of libertarian paternalism has been recognized in many
countries, including the UK and South Korea, and by politicians of many
stripes, including Tories and the Democratic administration of President
Obama. Indeed, Britain’s government has created a new small unit whose
mission is to apply the principles of behavioral science to help the
government better accomplish its goals. The official name for this group is
g
p
g
g
p
the Behavioural Insight Team, but it is known both in and out of government
simply as the Nudge Unit. Thaler is an adviser to this team.
In a storybook sequel to the writing of Nudge, Sunstein was invited by
President Obama to serve as administrator of the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, a position that gave him considerable opportunity to
encourage the application of the lessons of psychology and behavioral
economics in government agencies. The mission is described in the 2010
Report of the Office of Management and Budget. Readers of this book will
appreciate the logic behind specific recommendations, including
encouraging “clear, simple, salient, and meaningful disclosures.” They will
also recognize background statements such as “presentation greatly
matters; if, for example, a potential outcome is framed as a loss, it may
have more impact than if it is presented as a gain.”
The example of a regulation about the framing of disclosures concerning
fuel consumption was mentioned earlier. Additional applications that have
been implemented include automatic enrollment in health insurance, a new
version of the dietary guidelines that replaces the incomprehensible Food
Pyramid with the powerful image of a Food Plate loaded with a balanced
diet, and a rule formulated by the USDA that permits the inclusion of
messages such as “90% fat-free” on the label of meat products, provided
that the statement “10% fat” is also displayed “contiguous to, in lettering of
the same color, size, and type as, and on the same color background as,
the statement of lean percentage.” Humans, unlike Econs, need help to
make good decisions, and there are informed and unintrusive ways to
provide that help.
Two Systems
This book has described the workings of the mind as an uneasy interaction
between two fictitious characters: the automatic System 1 and the effortful
System 2. You are now quite familiar with the personalities of the two
systems and able to anticipate how they might respond in different
situations. And of course you also remember that the two systems do not
really exist in the brain or anywhere else. “System 1 does X” is a shortcut
for “X occurs automatically.” And “System 2 is mobilized to do Y” is a
shortcut for “arousal increases, pupils dilate, attention is fo
Stenations,cused, and activity Y is performed.” I hope you find the
language of systems as helpful as I do, and that you have acquired an
intuitive sense of how they work without getting confused by the question of
whether they exist. Having delivered this necessary warning, I will continue
to use the language to the end.
The attentive System 2 is who we think we are. System 2 articulates
judgments and makes choices, but it often endorses or rationalizes ideas
and feelings that were generated by System 1. You may not know that you
are optimistic about a project because something about its leader reminds
you of your beloved sister, or that you dislike a person who looks vaguely
like your dentist. If asked for an explanation, however, you will search your
memory for presentable reasons and will certainly find some. Moreover,
you will believe the story you make up. But System 2 is not merely an
apologist for System 1; it also prevents many foolish thoughts and
inappropriate i
