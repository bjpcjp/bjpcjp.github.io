EXPOSE AND ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT'S
SOFT FLANK
THE TURNING STRATEGY
When you attack people directly, you stiffen their resistance and make your task
that much harder. There is a better way: distract your opponents' attention to the
front, then attack them from the side, where they least expect it. By hitting them
where they are soft, tender, and unprotected, you create a shock, a moment of
weakness for you to exploit. Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their
weakness, then rake them with fire from the side. The only way to get stubborn
opponents to move is to approach them indirectly.
The Emperor [Napoleon Bonaparte] , while he was quite prepared "to break
eggs to make omelettes," as von Clausewitz puts it, was always eager to gain
total victory for a minimum expenditure of manpower and effort.
Consequently he disliked having to force a full-scale, fully arrayed frontal
battle--that is to say, marching directly against the enemy to fight him on
ground of his (the adversary's) choosing, for such battles were inevitably
expensive and rarely conclusive (Borodino in 1812 is a case in point).
Instead, whenever possible, after pinning the foe frontally by a feint attack, he
marched his main army by the quickest possible "safe" route, hidden by the
cavalry screen and natural obstacles, to place himself on the rear or flank of
his opponent. Once this move had been successfully achieved, he occupied a
natural barrier or "strategical curtain" (usually a river line or mountain
range), ordered the blocking of all crossings, and thus isolated his intended
victim from his rear depots and reduced his chances of reinforcement.
Thereafter, Napoleon advanced relentlessly toward the foe's army, offering
him only two alternatives--to fight for survival on ground not of his own
choosing, or to surrender. The advantages afforded by such a strategy are
obvious. The enemy army would be both taken by surprise and almost
certainly demoralized by the sudden apparition of the enemy army in its rear,
cutting its communications.

TURNING THE FLANK
In 1793, Louis XIV and his wife, Marie Antoinette, the king and queen of
France, were beheaded by order of the new government put in place after the
French Revolution. Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Maria Theresa, the
empress of Austria, and as a result of her death the Austrians became determined
enemies of France. Early in 1796 they prepared to invade the country from
northern Italy, which at the time was an Austrian possession.
In April of that year, the twenty-six-year-old Napoleon Bonaparte was given
command of the French army in Italy and charged with a simple mission: to
prevent these Austrian armies from entering France. Under Napoleon, for the
first time since the revolution not only were the French able to hold a defensive
position, but they successfully went on the offensive, pushing the Austrians
steadily east. Shocking as it was to lose to the revolutionary army, it was
downright humiliating to be defeated by an unknown general on his first
campaign. For six months the Austrians sent armies to defeat Napoleon, but he
forced each one to retreat into the fortress of Mantua, until finally this stronghold
was crammed with Austrian soldiers.
Leaving a force at Mantua to pin down the Austrians, Napoleon established
his base to the north, in the pivotal city of Verona. If the Austrians were to win
the war, they would somehow have to push him out of Verona and free up the
starving soldiers trapped in Mantua. And they were running out of time.
In October 1796, Baron Joseph d'Alvintzi was given command of some
50,000 Austrian soldiers and the urgent mission of expelling the French from
Verona. An experienced commander and clever strategist, d'Alvintzi studied
Napoleon's Italian campaign carefully and came to respect his enemy. To defeat
this brilliant young general, the Austrians would have to be more flexible, and
d'Alvintzi thought he had the solution: he would divide his army into two
columns, one under himself, the other under the Russian general Paul
Davidovich. The columns would separately march south, converging at Verona.
At the same time, d'Alvintzi would launch a campaign of deception to make
Napoleon think that Davidovich's army was small (it was in fact 18,000 men
strong), merely a holding force to protect the Austrian lines of communication. If
Napoleon underestimated Davidovich, the Russian general would face less
opposition and his way to Verona would be smooth. D'Alvintzi's plan was to trap
Napoleon between the jaws of these two armies.
The Austrians entered northern Italy in early November. To d'Alvintzi's
delight, Napoleon seemed to have fallen for their trick; he sent a relatively light
force against Davidovich, who promptly gave the French in Italy their first real
defeat and began his advance toward Verona. Meanwhile d'Alvintzi himself
advanced all the way to a point not far from Verona and was poised to fall on the
city from the east. As he pored over his maps, d'Alvintzi took pleasure in his
plan. If Napoleon sent more men to stop Davidovich, he would weaken Verona
against d'Alvintzi. If he tried to block d'Alvintzi's entrance from the east, he
would weaken Verona against Davidovich. If he sought reinforcements from his
troops at Mantua, he would free up the 20,000 Austrian soldiers trapped there
and they would gobble him up from the south. D'Alvintzi also knew that
Napoleon's men were exhausted and hungry. Having fought for six months
without rest, they were at a breaking point. Not even a young genius like
Napoleon could escape this trap.
A few days later, d'Alvintzi advanced to the village of Caldiero, at Verona's
doorstep. There he inflicted another defeat on the French troops sent to stop him.
After a string of victories, Napoleon had now lost two battles in a row; the
pendulum had swung against him.
As d'Alvintzi prepared for his final pounce on Verona, he received confusing
news: against all prediction Napoleon had in fact divided his army in Verona, but
instead of sending parts of it against either d'Alvintzi or Davidovich, he had
marched a sizable force somewhere to the southeast. The next day this army
appeared outside the town of Arcola. If the French crossed the river to Arcola
and advanced a few miles north, they would directly cross d'Alvintzi's line of
communications and of retreat, and they would be able to seize his supply depots
at Villa Nova. Having this large French army to his rear was more than alarming;
d'Alvintzi was forced to forget about Verona for the moment and hastily marched
east.
He had retreated in the nick of time and was able to halt the French before
they could cross the river and attack Villa Nova. For several days the two armies
settled into a fiercely contested battle for the bridge at Arcola. Napoleon himself
led several charges and was nearly killed. A portion of the troops blocking
Mantua were dispatched north to reinforce the French at Arcola, but d'Alvintzi's
army hunkered down, and the battle turned into a stalemate.
On the third day of fighting, d'Alvintzi's soldiers--their lines thinned by
relentless French attacks--were preparing for another battle for the bridge when
they suddenly heard trumpets blaring from their southern flank. A French force
had somehow crossed the river below the bridge and was marching toward the
Austrian flank at Arcola. The sound of trumpets was quickly replaced by shouts
and the whizzing of bullets. The sudden appearance of the French on their flank
was too much for the wearied Austrians; not waiting to see the size of the French
force, they panicked and fled the scene. The French poured across the river.
D'Alvintzi gathered up his men as best he could and managed to lead them east
to safety. But the battle for Verona was lost, and with it the doom of Mantua was
sealed.
Somehow Napoleon had managed to snatch victory from defeat. The battle
of Arcola helped forge the legend of his invincibility.
Now came the critical problem of judging the correct moment for the
enveloping force to reveal its disconcerting position on the enemy flank. For
maximum effect, it was important that this should not occur before the enemy
had committed all or most of his reserves to the frontal battle, and this need
for accurate timing of the flank attack called for the greatest judgment on the
part of Napoleon and his key subordinates. The former had to judge the
moment when all the enemy troops were indeed committed to the frontal
battle (and with the billowing clouds of black-powder smoke obliterating the
scene this was no easy matter); the latter had the task of keeping their eager
troops "on the leash" so as to avoid any premature attack disclosing their
presence. Then, when the exact moment came, Napoleon would give the
signal.... Then the attaque debordante would spring to life. A roar of cannon
away on his hitherto secure flank would cause the enemy to look
apprehensively over his shoulder, and before long the spyglasses of his
anxious staff would be able to detect a line of dust and smoke crawling ever
nearer from the flank or rear. This threat to his communications and line of
retreat could not be ignored. The enemy general might now theoretically
adopt one of two courses (but in practice only one). He could either order an
immediate general retreat to slip out of the trap before it shut behind his army
(although this was generally out of the question, as Napoleon would of course
launch a general frontal attack against all sectors of the enemy line to
coincide with the unmasking of his flanking force and thus pin the foe still
tighter to the ground he was holding); or he would be compelled to find
troops from somewhere to form a new line at right angles to his main position
to face the new onslaught and protect his flank. As all reserves were (ideally)
already committed to battle, this could be easily and quickly effected only by
deliberately weakening those frontal sectors closest to the new threat. This
thinning out of the enemy front is what Napoleon termed "the Event"--and
was of course exactly what he intended to have happen. The curtain on the
first act would now fall; the enemy was reacting as required; the destruction
of the cohesion of his line, the final ruination of his equilibrium, could now be
undertaken with practically a guarantee of ultimate success.
THE CAMPAIGNS OF NAPOLEON, DAVID G. CHANDLER, 1966
Interpretation
Napoleon was no magician, and his defeat of the Austrians in Italy was
deceptively simple. Facing two armies converging on him, he calculated that
d'Alvintzi's was the more imminent danger. The fight for Caldiero encouraged
the Austrians to think that Verona would be defended through direct, frontal
confrontation. But Napoleon instead divided his army and sent the larger portion
of it to threaten the Austrian supply depot and lines of communication and
retreat. Had d'Alvintzi ignored the threat and advanced on Verona, he would
have moved farther away from his critical base of operations and put himself in
great jeopardy; had he stayed put, Napoleon would have squeezed him between
two armies. In fact, Napoleon knew d'Alvintzi would have to retreat--the threat
was too real--and once he had done so, he would have relinquished the initiative.
At Arcola, sensing that the enemy was tiring, Napoleon sent a small contingent
to cross the river to the south and march on the Austrian flank, with instructions
to make as much noise as possible--trumpets, shouts, gunfire. The presence of
this attacking force, small though it was, would induce panic and collapse. The
ruse worked.
This maneuver--the manoeuvre sur les derrieres, Napoleon called it--would
become a favorite strategy of his. Its success was based on two truths: First,
generals like to place their armies in a strong frontal position, whether to make
an attack or to meet one. Napoleon would often play on this tendency to face
forward in battle by seeming to engage the enemy frontally; in the fog of battle,
it was hard to tell that really only half of his army was deployed here, and
meanwhile he would sneak the other half to the side or rear. Second, an army
sensing attack from the flank is alarmed and vulnerable and must turn to face the
threat. This moment of turning contains great weakness and confusion. Even an
army in the stronger position, like d'Alvintzi's at Verona, will almost always lose
cohesion and balance as it turns.
Learn from the great master himself: attacking from the front is rarely wise.
The soldiers facing you will be tightly packed in, a concentration of force that
will amplify their power to resist you. Go for their flank, their vulnerable side.
This principle is applicable to conflicts or encounters of any scale.
Individuals often show their flank, signal their vulnerability, by its opposite,
the front they show most visibly to the world. This front can be an aggressive
personality, a way of dealing with people by pushing them around. Or it can be
some obvious defense mechanism, a focus on keeping out intruders to maintain
stability in their lives. It can be their most cherished beliefs and ideas; it can be
the way they make themselves liked. The more you get people to expose this
front, to show more of themselves and the directions they tend to move in, the
more their unprotected flanks will come into focus--unconscious desires, gaping
insecurities, precarious alliances, uncontrollable compulsions. Once you move
on their flanks, your targets will turn to face you and lose their equilibrium. All
enemies are vulnerable from their sides. There is no defense against a well-
designed flanking maneuver.
Opposition to the truth is inevitable, especially if it takes the form of a new
idea, but the degree of resistance can be diminished--by giving thought not
only to the aim but to the method of approach. Avoid a frontal attack on a
long-established position; instead, seek to turn it by flank movement, so that a
more penetrable side is exposed to the thrust of truth.

OCCUPYING THE FLANK
As a young man, Julius Caesar (100-44 B.C.) was once captured by pirates.
They asked for a ransom of twenty talents; laughing, he replied that a man of his
nobility was worth fifty talents, and he volunteered to pay that sum. His
attendants were sent for the money, and Caesar was left alone with these
bloodthirsty pirates. For the weeks he remained among them, he participated in
their games and revelry, even playing a little rough with them, joking that he
would have them crucified someday.
Amused by this spirited yet affectionate young man, the pirates practically
adopted him as their own. But once the ransom was paid and Caesar was freed,
he proceeded to the nearest port, manned some ships at his own expense, then
went after the pirates and surprised them in their lair. At first they welcomed him
back--but Caesar had them arrested, took back the money he had given them,
and, as promised, had them crucified. In the years to come, many would learn--
whether to their delight or to their horror--that this was how Caesar did battle.
Caesar, however, did not always exact retribution. In 62 B.C., during a
religious ceremony in Caesar's home, a young man named Publius Clodius was
caught among the female celebrants, dressed as a woman and cavorting with
Caesar's wife, Pompeia. This was considered an outrage, and Caesar
immediately divorced Pompeia, saying, "My wife must be above suspicion." Yet
when Clodius was arrested and tried for sacrilege, Caesar used his money and
influence to get the youth acquitted. He was more than repaid a few years later,
when he was preparing to leave Rome for wars in Gaul and needed someone to
protect his interests while he was away. He used his clout to get Clodius named
to the political office of tribune, and in that position Clodius doggedly supported
Caesar's interests, stirring up so much trouble in the Senate with his obnoxious
maneuvers that no one had the time or inclination to intrigue against the absent
general.
During this survey one impression became increasingly strong--that,
throughout the ages, effective results in war have rarely been attained unless
the approach has had such indirectness as to ensure the opponent's
unreadiness to meet it. The indirectness has usually been physical, and
always psychological. In strategy, the longest way round is often the shortest
way home. More and more clearly has the lesson emerged that a direct
approach to one's mental object, or physical objective, along the "line of
natural expectation" for the opponent, tends to produce negative results. The
reason has been expressed vividly in Napoleon's dictum that "the moral is to
the physical as three to one." It may be expressed scientifically by saying that,
while the strength of an opposing force or country lies outwardly in its
numbers and resources, these are fundamentally dependent upon stability of
control, morale, and supply. To move along the line of natural expectation
consolidates the opponent's balance and thus increases his resisting power. In
war, as in wrestling, the attempt to throw the opponent without loosening his
foothold and upsetting his balance results in self-exhaustion, increasing in
disproportionate ratio to the effective strain put upon him. Success by such a
method only becomes possible through an immense margin of superior
strength in some form--and, even so, tends to lose decisiveness. In most
campaigns the dislocation of the enemy's psychological and physical balance
has been the vital prelude to a successful attempt at his overthrow.
STRATEGY, B. H. LIDDELL HART, 1954
The three most powerful men in Rome at the time were Caesar, Crassus, and
Pompey. Fearing Pompey, a popular and famously successful general, Crassus
tried to form a secret alliance with Caesar, but Caesar balked; instead, a few
years later, he approached the wary Pompey (who was suspicious of and hostile
toward Caesar as a possible future rival) and suggested they form their own
alliance. In return he promised to support some of Pompey's political proposals,
which had been stalled in the Senate. Surprised, Pompey agreed, and Crassus,
not wanting to be left out, agreed to join the group to form the First Triumvirate,
which was to rule Rome for the next several years.
In 53 B.C., Crassus was killed in battle in Syria, and a power struggle
quickly emerged between Pompey and Caesar. Civil war seemed inevitable, and
Pompey had more support in the Senate. In 50 B.C., the Senate ordered that both
Caesar (who was fighting in Gaul at the time) and Pompey should send one of
their legions to Syria to support the Roman army fighting there. But since
Pompey had already lent Caesar a legion for the war in Gaul, he proposed to
send that one to Syria--so that Caesar would have lost two legions instead of
one, weakening him for the impending war.
Caesar did not complain. He sent off the two legions, one of which,
however--as he had expected--did not go to Syria but was conveniently quartered
near Rome, at Pompey's disposal. Before the two legions left, Caesar paid each
soldier handsomely. He also instructed their officers to spread the rumor in
Rome that his troops still in Gaul were exhausted and that, should he dare to
send them against Pompey, they would switch sides as soon as they had crossed
the Alps. Coming to believe these false reports, and expecting massive
defections, Pompey did not trouble to recruit more soldiers for the imminent war,
which he would later regret.
In January of 49 B.C., Caesar crossed the Rubicon, the river between Gaul
and Italy, a dramatic, unexpected move that initiated the Civil War. Caught by
surprise, Pompey fled with his legions to Greece, where he began to prepare a
major operation. As Caesar marched south, many of Pompey's supporters, left
behind in Rome, were terrified. Caesar had established a reputation in Gaul for
br
