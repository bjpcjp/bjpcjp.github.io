AVOID THE SNARES OF GROUPTHINK
THE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL STRATEGY
The problem in leading any group is that people inevitably have their own
agendas. If you are too authoritarian, they will resent you and rebel in silent
ways. If you are too easygoing, they will revert to their natural selfishness and
you will lose control. You have to create a chain of command in which people do
not feel constrained by your influence yet follow your lead. Put the right people
in place--people who will enact the spirit of your ideas without being
automatons. Make your commands clear and inspiring, focusing attention on the
team, not the leader. Create a sense of participation, but do not fall into
Groupthink--the irrationality of collective decision making. Make yourself look
like a paragon of fairness, but never relinquish unity of command.
How very different is the cohesion between that of an army rallying around
one flag carried into battle at the personal command of one general and that
of an allied military force extending 50 or 100 leagues, or even on different
sides of the theater! In the first case, cohesion is at its strongest and unity at
its closest. In the second case, the unity is very remote, often consisting of no
more than a shared political intention, and therefore only scanty and
imperfect, while the cohesion of the parts is mostly weak and often no more
than an illusion.
ON WAR, CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
THE BROKEN CHAIN
World War I began in August 1914, and by the end of that year, all along the
Western Front, the British and French were caught in a deadly stalemate with the
Germans. Meanwhile, though, on the Eastern Front, Germany was badly beating
the Russians, allies of Britain and France. Britain's military leaders had to try a
new strategy, and their plan, backed by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston
Churchill and others, was to stage an attack on Gallipoli, a peninsula on Turkey's
Dardanelles Strait. Turkey was an ally of Germany's, and the Dardanelles was
the gateway to Constantinople, the Turkish capital (present-day Istanbul). If the
Allies could take Gallipoli, Constantinople would follow, and Turkey would
have to leave the war. In addition, using bases in Turkey and the Balkans, the
Allies could attack Germany from the southeast, dividing its armies and
weakening its ability to fight on the Western Front. They would also have a clear
supply line to Russia. Victory at Gallipoli would change the course of the war.
The plan was approved, and in March 1915, General Sir Ian Hamilton was
named to lead the campaign. Hamilton, at sixty-two, was an able strategist and
an experienced commander. He and Churchill felt certain that their forces,
including Australians and New Zealanders, would out-match the Turks.
Churchill's orders were simple: take Constantinople. He left the details to the
general.
Hamilton's plan was to land at three points on the southwestern tip of the
Gallipoli peninsula, secure the beaches, and sweep north. The landings took
place on April 27. From the beginning almost everything went wrong: the army's
maps were inaccurate, its troops landed in the wrong places, the beaches were
much narrower than expected. Worst of all, the Turks fought back unexpectedly
fiercely and well. At the end of the first day, most of the Allies' 70,000 men had
landed, but they were unable to advance beyond the beaches, where the Turks
would hold them pinned down for several weeks. It was another stalemate;
Gallipoli had become a disaster.
All seemed lost, but in June, Churchill convinced the government to send
more troops and Hamilton devised a new plan. He would land 20,000 men at
Suvla Bay, some twenty miles to the north. Suvla was a vulnerable target: it had
a large harbor, the terrain was lowlying and easy, and it was defended by only a
handful of Turks. An invasion here would force the Turks to divide their forces,
freeing up the Allied armies to the south. The stalemate would be broken, and
Gallipoli would fall.
To command the Suvla operation Hamilton was forced to accept the most
senior Englishman available for the job, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick
Stopford. Under him, Major General Frederick Hammersley would lead the
Eleventh Division. Neither of these men was Hamilton's first choice. Stopford, a
sixty-one-year-old military teacher, had never led troops in war and saw artillery
bombardment as the only way to win a battle; he was also in poor health.
Hammersley, for his part, had suffered a nervous breakdown the previous year.
In war it is not men, but the man, that counts.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821
Hamilton's style was to tell his officers the purpose of an upcoming battle
but leave it to them how to bring it about. He was a gentleman, never blunt or
forceful. At one of their first meetings, for example, Stopford requested changes
in the landing plans to reduce risk. Hamilton politely deferred to him.
Hamilton did have one request. Once the Turks knew of the landings at
Suvla, they would rush in reinforcements. As soon as the Allies were ashore,
then, Hamilton wanted them to advance immediately to a range of hills four
miles inland, called Tekke Tepe, and to get there before the Turks. From Tekke
Tepe the Allies would dominate the peninsula. The order was simple enough, but
Hamilton, so as not to offend his subordinate, expressed it in the most general
terms. Most crucially, he specified no time frame. He was sufficiently vague that
Stopford completely misinterpreted him: instead of trying to reach Tekke Tepe
"as soon as possible," Stopford thought he should advance to the hills "if
possible." That was the order he gave Hammersley. And as Hammersley,
nervous about the whole campaign, passed it down to his colonels, the order
became less urgent and vaguer still.
Also, despite his deference to Stopford, Hamilton overruled the lieutenant
general in one respect: he denied a request for more artillery bombardments to
loosen up the Turks. Stopford's troops would outnumber the Turks at Suvla ten
to one, Hamilton replied; more artillery was superfluous.
The attack began in the early morning of August 7. Once again much turned
bad: Stopford's changes in the landing plans made a mess. As his officers came
ashore, they began to argue, uncertain about their positions and objectives. They
sent messengers to ask their next step: Advance? Consolidate? Hammersley had
no answers. Stopford had stayed on a boat offshore, from which to control the
battlefield--but on that boat he was impossible to reach quickly enough to get
prompt orders from him. Hamilton was on an island still farther away. The day
was frittered away in argument and the endless relaying of messages.
The next morning Hamilton began to sense that something had gone very
wrong. From reconnaissance aircraft he knew that the flat land around Suvla was
essentially empty and undefended; the way to Tekke Tepe was open--the troops
had only to march--but they were staying where they were. Hamilton decided to
visit the front himself. Reaching Stopford's boat late that afternoon, he found the
general in a self-congratulatory mood: all 20,000 men had gotten ashore. No, he
had not yet ordered the troops to advance to the hills; without artillery he was
afraid the Turks might counterattack, and he needed the day to consolidate his
positions and to land supplies. Hamilton strained to control himself: he had
heard an hour earlier that Turkish reinforcements had been seen hurrying toward
Suvla. The Allies would have to secure Tekke Tepe this evening, he said--but
Stopford was against a night march. Too dangerous. Hamilton retained his cool
and politely excused himself.
Any army is like a horse, in that it reflects the temper and the spirit of its
rider. If there is an uneasiness and an uncertainty, it transmits itself through
the reins, and the horse feels uneasy and uncertain.
LONE STAR PREACHER, COLONEL JOHN W. THOMASON, JR., 1941
In near panic, Hamilton decided to visit Hammersley at Suvla. Much to his
dismay, he found the army lounging on the beach as if it were a bank holiday. He
finally located Hammersley--he was at the far end of the bay, busily supervising
the building of his temporary headquarters. Asked why he had failed to secure
the hills, Hammersley replied that he had sent several brigades for the purpose,
but they had encountered Turkish artillery and his colonels had told him they
could not advance without more instructions. Communications between
Hammersley, Stopford, and the colonels in the field were taking forever, and
when Stopford had finally been reached, he had sent the message back to
Hammersley to proceed cautiously, rest his men, and wait to advance until the
next day. Hamilton could control himself no longer: a handful of Turks with a
few guns were holding up an army of 20,000 men from marching a mere four
miles! Tomorrow morning would be too late; the Turkish reinforcements were
on their way. Although it was already night, Hamilton ordered Hammersley to
send a brigade immediately to Tekke Tepe. It would be a race to the finish.
Hamilton returned to a boat in the harbor to monitor the situation. At sunrise
the next morning, he watched the battlefield through binoculars--and saw, to his
horror, the Allied troops in headlong retreat to Suvla. A large Turkish force had
arrived at Tekke Tepe thirty minutes before them. In the next few days, the Turks
managed to regain the flats around Suvla and to pin Hamilton's army on the
beach. Some four months later, the Allies gave up their attack on Gallipoli and
evacuated their troops.
Interpretation
In planning the invasion at Suvla, Hamilton thought of everything. He
understood the need for surprise, deceiving the Turks about the landing site. He
mastered the logistical details of a complex amphibious assault. Locating the key
point--Tekke Tepe--from which the Allies could break the stalemate in Gallipoli,
he crafted an excellent strategy to get there. He even tried to prepare for the kind
of unexpected contingencies that can always happen in battle. But he ignored the
one thing closest to him: the chain of command, and the circuit of
communications by which orders, information, and decisions would circulate
back and forth. He was dependent on that circuit to give him control of the
situation and allow him to execute his strategy.
The first links in the chain of command were Stopford and Hammersley.
Both men were terrified of risk, and Hamilton failed to adapt himself to their
weakness: his order to reach Tekke Tepe was polite, civilized, and unforceful,
and Stopford and Hammersley interpreted it according to their fears. They saw
Tekke Tepe as a possible goal to aim for once the beaches were secured.
The next links in the chain were the colonels who were to lead the assault on
Tekke Tepe. They had no contact with Hamilton on his island or with Stopford
on his boat, and Hammersley was too overwhelmed to lead them. They
themselves were terrified of acting on their own and maybe messing up a plan
they had never understood; they hesitated at every step. Below the colonels were
officers and soldiers who, without leadership, were left wandering on the beach
like lost ants. Vagueness at the top turned into confusion and lethargy at the
bottom. Success depended on the speed with which information could pass in
both directions along the chain of command, so that Hamilton could understand
what was happening and adapt faster than the enemy. The chain was broken, and
Gallipoli was lost.
When a failure like this happens, when a golden opportunity slips through
your fingers, you naturally look for a cause. Maybe you blame your incompetent
officers, your faulty technology, your flawed intelligence. But that is to look at
the world backward; it ensures more failure. The truth is that everything starts
from the top. What determines your failure or success is your style of leadership
and the chain of command that you design. If your orders are vague and
halfhearted, by the time they reach the field they will be meaningless. Let people
work unsupervised and they will revert to their natural selfishness: they will see
in your orders what they want to see, and their behavior will promote their own
interests.
Unless you adapt your leadership style to the weaknesses of the people in
your group, you will almost certainly end up with a break in the chain of
command. Information in the field will reach you too slowly. A proper chain of
command, and the control it brings you, is not an accident; it is your creation, a
work of art that requires constant attention and care. Ignore it at your peril.
For what the leaders are, that, as a rule, will the men below them be.
--Xenophon (430?-355? B.C.)
REMOTE CONTROL
In the late 1930s, U.S. Brigadier General George C. Marshall (1880-1958)
preached the need for major military reform. The army had too few soldiers,
they were badly trained, current doctrine was ill suited to modern technology--
the list of problems went on. In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had to
select his next army chief of staff. The appointment was critical: World War II
had begun in Europe, and Roosevelt believed that the United States was sure to
get involved. He understood the need for military reform, so he bypassed
generals with more seniority and experience and chose Marshall for the job.
The appointment was a curse in disguise, for the War Department was
hopelessly dysfunctional. Many of its generals had monstrous egos and the
power to impose their way of doing things. Senior officers, instead of retiring,
took jobs in the department, amassing power bases and fiefdoms that they did
everything they could to protect. A place of feuds, waste, communication
breakdowns, and overlapping jobs, the department was a mess. How could
Marshall revamp the army for global war if he could not control it? How could
he create order and efficiency?
What must be the result of an operation which is but partially understood by
the commander, since it is not his own conception? I have undergone a
pitiable experience as prompter at headquarters, and no one has a better
appreciation of the value of such services than myself; and it is particularly
in a council of war that such a part is absurd. The greater the number and the
higher the rank of the military officers who compose the council, the more
difficult will it be to accomplish the triumph of truth and reason, however
small be the amount of dissent. What would have been the action of a council
of war to which Napoleon proposed the movement of Arcola, the crossing of
the Saint-Bernard, the maneuver at Ulm, or that at Gera and Jena? The timid
would have regarded them as rash, even to madness, others would have seen
a thousand difficulties of execution, and all would have concurred in rejecting
them; and if, on the contrary, they had been adopted, and had been executed
by any one but Napoleon, would they not certainly have proved failures?
BARON ANTOINE-HENRI DE JOMINI, 1779-1869
Some ten years earlier, Marshall had served as the assistant commander of
the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he had trained many
officers. Throughout his time there, he had kept a notebook in which he recorded
the names of promising young men. Soon after becoming chief of staff, Marshall
began to retire the older officers in the War Department and replace them with
these younger men whom he had personally trained. These officers were
ambitious, they shared his desire for reform, and he encouraged them to speak
their minds and show initiative. They included men like Omar Bradley and Mark
Clark, who would be crucial in World War II, but no one was more important
than the protege Marshall spent the most time on: Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The relationship began a few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when
Marshall asked Eisenhower, then a colonel, to prepare a report on what should
be done in the Far East. The report showed Marshall that Eisenhower shared his
ideas on how to run the war. For the next few months, he kept Eisenhower in the
War Plans Division and watched him closely: the two men met every day, and in
that time Eisenhower soaked up Marshall's style of leadership, his way of getting
things done. Marshall tested Eisenhower's patience by indicating that he planned
to keep him in Washington instead of giving him the field assignment that he
desperately wanted. The colonel passed the test. Much like Marshall himself, he
got along well with other officers yet was quietly forceful.
In July 1942, as the Americans prepared to enter the war by fighting
alongside the British in North Africa, Marshall surprised one and all by naming
Eisenhower commander in the European Theater of Operations. Eisenhower was
by this time a lieutenant general but was still relatively unknown, and in his first
few months in the job, as the Americans fared poorly in North Africa, the British
clamored for a replacement. But Marshall stood by his man, offering him advice
and encouragement. One key suggestion was for Eisenhower to develop a
protege, much as Marshall had with him--a kind of roving deputy who thought
the way he did and would act as his go-between with subordinates. Marshall's
suggestion for the post was Major General Bradley, a man he knew well;
Eisenhower accepted the idea, essentially duplicating the staff structure that
Marshall had created in the War Department. With Bradley in place, Marshall
left Eisenhower alone.
Marshall positioned his proteges throughout the War Department, where
they quietly spread his way of doing things. To make the task easier, he cut the
waste in the department with utter ruthlessness, reducing from sixty to six the
number of deputies who reported to him. Marshall hated excess; his reports to
Roosevelt made him famous for his ability to summarize a complex situation in
a few pages. The six men who reported to him found that any report that lasted a
page too long simply went unread. He would listen to their oral presentations
with rapt attention, but the minute they wandered from the topic or said
something not thought through, he would look away, bored, uninterested. It was
an expression they dreaded: without saying a word, he had made it known that
they had displeased him and it was time for them to leave. Marshall's six
deputies began to think like him and to demand from those who reported to them
the efficiency and streamlined communications style he demanded of them. The
speed of the information flow up and down the line was now quadrupled.
"Do you think every Greek here can be a king? It's no good having a carload
of commanders. We need One commander, one king, the one to whom Zeus,
Son of Cronus the crooked, has given the staff And the right to make decisions
for his people." And so Odysseus mastered the army. The men all Streamed
back from their ships and huts and assembled With a roar.
 
THE ILIAD, HOMER, CIRCA NINTH CENTURY B.C.
Marshall exuded authority but never yelled and never challenged men
frontally. He had a knack for communicating his wishes indirectly--a skill that
was all the more effective since it made his officers think about what he meant.
Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the military director of the project to
develop the atom bomb, once came to Marshall's office to get him to sign off on
$100 million in expenditures. Finding the chief of staff engrossed in paperwork,
he waited while Marshall diligently compared documents and made notes.
Finally Marshall put down his pen, examined the $100 million request, signed it,
and returned it to Groves without a word. The general thanked him and was
turning to leave when Marshall finally spoke: "It may interest you to know what
I was doing: I was writing the check for $3.52 for grass seed for my lawn."
The thousands who worked under Marshall, whether in the War Department
or abroad in the field, did not have to see him personally to feel his presence.
They felt it in the terse but insightful
