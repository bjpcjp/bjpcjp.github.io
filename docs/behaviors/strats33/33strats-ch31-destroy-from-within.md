DESTROY FROM WITHIN
THE INNER-FRONT STRATEGY
A war can only really be fought against an enemy who shows himself. By
infiltrating your opponents' ranks, working from within to bring them down, you
give them nothing to see or react against--the ultimate advantage. From within,
you also learn their weaknesses and open up possibilities of sowing internal
dissension. So hide your hostile intentions. To take something you want, do not
fight those who have it, but rather join them--then either slowly make it your
own or wait for the moment to stage a coup d'etat. No structure can stand for
long when it rots from within.
Athene now inspired Prylis, son of Hermes, to suggest that entry should be
gained into Troy by means of a wooden horse; and Epeius, son of Panopeus,
a Phocian from Parnassus, volunteered to build one under Athene's
supervision. Afterwards, of course, Odysseus claimed all the credit for this
stratagem...... [Epeius] built an enormous hollow horse of fir planks, with a
trapdoor fitted into one flank, and large letters cut on the other which
consecrated it to Athene: "In thankful anticipation of a safe return to their
homes, the Greeks dedicate this offering to the Goddess." Odysseus
persuaded the bravest of the Greeks to climb fully armed up a rope-ladder
and through the trapdoor into the belly of the horse.... Among them were
Menelaus, 
Odysseus, 
Diomedes, 
Sthenelus, 
Acamas, 
Thoas, 
and
Neoptolemus. Coaxed, threatened, and bribed, Epeius himself joined the
party. He climbed up last, drew the ladder in after him and, since he alone
knew how to work the trapdoor, took his seat beside the lock. At nightfall, the
remaining Greeks under Agamemnon followed Odysseus's instructions, which
were to burn their camp, put out to sea and wait off Tenedos and the
Calydnian Islands until the following evening....... At the break of day, Trojan
scouts reported that the camp lay in ashes and that the Greeks had departed,
leaving a huge horse on the seashore. Priam and several of his sons went out
to view it and, as they stood staring in wonder, Thymoetes was the first to
break the silence. "Since this is a gift to Athene," he said, "I propose that we
take it into Troy and haul it up to her citadel." "No, no!" cried Capys. "Athene
favoured the Greeks too long; we must either burn it at once or break it open
to see what the belly contains." But Priam declared: "Thymoetes is right. We
will fetch it in on rollers. Let nobody desecrate Athene's property." The horse
proved too broad to be squeezed through the gates. Even when the wall had
been breached, it stuck four times. With enormous efforts the Trojans then
hauled it up to the citadel; but at least took the precaution of repairing the
breach behind them.... At midnight...Odysseus ordered Epeius to unlock the
trapdoor.... Now the Greeks poured silently through the moonlit streets, broke
into the unguarded houses, and cut the throats of the Trojans as they slept.
THE GREEK MYTHS, VOL. 2, ROBERT GRAVES, 1955
THE INVISIBLE ENEMY
Late in 1933, Adolf Hitler appointed the forty-six-year-old Rear Admiral
Wilhelm Canaris chief of the Abwehr, the secret intelligence and counter-
espionage service of the German General Staff. Hitler had recently won
dictatorial powers as the ruler of Germany, and, with an eye on future conquests
in Europe, he wanted Canaris to make the Abwehr an agency as efficient as the
British Secret Service. Canaris was a slightly odd choice for the position. He
came from the aristocracy, was not a member of the Nazi Party, and had not had
a particularly outstanding military career. But Hitler saw traits in Canaris that
would make him a superior spymaster: cunning in the extreme, a man made for
intrigue and deception, he knew how to get results. He would also owe his
promotion exclusively to Hitler.
In the years to come, Hitler would have reason to feel proud of his choice.
Canaris rigorously reorganized the Abwehr and extended its spy networks
throughout Europe. Then, in May 1940, he provided exceptional intelligence for
the blitzkrieg invasion of France and the Low Countries early in World War II.
And so, in the summer of that same year, Hitler gave Canaris his most important
task to date: providing intelligence for Operation Sealion, a plan to conquer
England. After the blitzkrieg and the evacuation of the Allied army at Dunkirk,
the British seemed deeply vulnerable, and knocking them out of the war at this
point would ensure Hitler's conquest of Europe.
A few weeks into the job, however, Canaris reported that the Germans had
underestimated the size of the English army and air force. Sealion would require
resources much larger than the Fuhrer had anticipated; unless Hitler was willing
to commit many more troops, it could turn into a mess. This was highly
disappointing news for Hitler, who had wanted to knock out England in one
quick blow. With his eye on an imminent invasion of Russia, he was unwilling to
commit large numbers to Sealion or to spend years subduing the British. Having
come to trust Canaris, he abandoned the planned invasion.
That same summer General Alfred Jodl came up with a brilliant plan to
damage England in another way: using Spain as a base of operations, he would
invade the British-owned island of Gibraltar, cutting off England's sea routes
through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to its empire in India and points
east--a disastrous blow. But the Germans would have to act fast, before the
English caught on to the threat. Excited by the prospect of ruining England in
this indirect way, Hitler once again asked Canaris to assess the plan. The Abwehr
chief went to Spain, studied the situation, and reported back. The moment a
German army moved into Spain, he said, the English would see the plan, and
Gibraltar had elaborate defenses. The Germans would also need the cooperation
of Francisco Franco, dictator of Spain, who Canaris believed would not be
sufficiently helpful. In short: Gibraltar was not worth the effort.
There were many around Hitler who believed that taking Gibraltar was
eminently realizable and could mean overall victory in the war against Britain.
Shocked at Canaris's report, they vocally expressed their doubts about the
intelligence he had been providing all along. His enigmatic nature--he spoke
little and was impossible to read--only fueled their suspicions that he was not to
be trusted. Hitler heard his staff out, but a meeting with Generalissimo Franco to
discuss the Gibraltar plan indirectly corroborated everything Canaris had said.
Franco was difficult and made all kinds of silly demands; the Spanish would be
impossible to deal with; the logistics were too complicated. Hitler quickly lost
interest in Jodl's plan.
In the years that followed, German officials in increasing numbers would
come to suspect Canaris of disloyalty to the Third Reich, but no one could pin
anything concrete on him. And Hitler himself had great faith in the Abwehr chief
and sent him on critical top-secret missions. One such assignment occurred in
the summer of 1943, when Marshal Pietro Badoglio, the former chief of the
Italian General Staff, arrested Benito Mussolini, dictator of Italy and Hitler's
staunchest ally. The Germans feared that Badoglio might secretly open talks with
General Dwight D. Eisenhower for Italy's surrender--a devastating blow to the
Axis that Hitler could forestall, if necessary, by sending an army to Rome,
arresting Badoglio, and occupying the capital. But was it necessary?
Hitler's armies were needed elsewhere, so Canaris was dispatched to assess
the likelihood of Italy's surrender. He met with his counterpart in the Italian
government, General Cesare Ame, then arranged for a meeting between high-
ranking members of both countries' intelligence services. At the meeting, Ame
emphatically denied that Badoglio had any intention of betraying Germany; in
fact, the marshal was fiercely loyal to the cause. And Ame was very convincing.
Hitler accordingly left Italy alone. A few weeks later, however, Badoglio indeed
surrendered to Eisenhower, and the valuable Italian fleet moved into Allied
hands. Canaris had been fooled--or was it Canaris who had done the fooling?
General Walter Schellenberg, chief of the foreign intelligence branch of the
SS, began to investigate the Badoglio fiasco and found two men in Ame's service
who had listened in on one of Canaris's talks with their boss. Canaris, they
reported, had known of Badoglio's intentions to surrender all along and had
collaborated with Ame to deceive Hitler. Surely this time the Abwehr chief had
been caught in the act and would pay with his life. Schellenberg accumulated a
thick dossier of other actions that cast more doubts on Canaris. He presented it to
Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, who, however, told his subordinate to keep
quiet--he would present the dossier to Hitler when the time was right. Yet, to
Schellenberg's dismay, months went by and Himmler did nothing, except
eventually to retire Canaris with honors from the service.
Shortly after Canaris's retirement, his diaries fell into the hands of the SS.
They revealed that he had conspired against Hitler from the beginning of his
service as Abwehr chief, even plotting to assassinate the Fuhrer in schemes that
had only barely misfired. Canaris was sent to a concentration camp, where, in
April 1945, he was tortured and killed.
Interpretation
Wilhelm Canaris was a devoutly patriotic and conservative man. In the earliest
days of the Nazi Party's rise to power, he had come to believe that Hitler would
lead his beloved Germany to destruction. But what could he do? He was just one
man, and to raise his voice against Hitler would get him no more than a little
publicity and an early death. Canaris cared only about results. So he kept quiet,
and, when offered the job of Abwehr chief, he seized his opportunity. At first he
bided his time, gaining credibility by his work in the Abwehr and getting to
understand the inner workings of the Nazi government. Meanwhile he secretly
organized a group of like-minded conspirators, the Schwarze Kapelle (Black
Orchestra), who would hatch several plots to kill Hitler. From his position in the
Abwehr, Canaris was to some extent able to protect the Schwarze Kapelle from
investigation. He also quietly gathered intelligence on the dirtiest secrets of high-
ranking Nazis like Himmler and let them know that any move against him would
result in revelations that would ruin them.
Assigned to prepare for Operation Sealion, Canaris doctored the intelligence
to make England look much more formidable than it was. Assigned to
investigate an invasion of Gibraltar, he secretly told the Spanish that to let
Germany use their country would spell disaster: Germany would never leave.
Hence Franco's alienating treatment of Hitler. In both of these cases, Canaris
exploited Hitler's impatience for quick and easy victories to discourage him from
ventures that could have easily and irrevocably turned the war in his favor.
Finally, in the case of Badoglio, Canaris understood Hitler's weak spot--a
paranoid concern with the loyalty of others--and coached Ame on how to appeal
to this weakness and make a show of Italy's devotion to the Axis cause. The
results of Canaris's work from the inside are astounding: one man played a major
role in saving England, Spain, and Italy from disaster, arguably turning the tide
of the war. The resources of the German war machine were essentially at his
disposal, to disrupt and derail its efforts.
As the story of Canaris demonstrates, if there is something you want to fight
or destroy, it is often best to repress your desire to act out your hostility,
revealing your position and letting the other side know your intentions. What
you gain in publicity, and perhaps in feeling good about expressing yourself
openly, you lose in a curtailment of your power to cause real damage,
particularly if the enemy is strong.
Instead the ultimate strategy is to seem to stay on the enemy side, burrowing
deep into its heart. From there you can gather valuable information: weaknesses
to attack, incriminating evidence to publicize. Here subtle maneuvers, like
passing along false information or steering your opponent into a self-destructive
policy, can have large effects--much larger than anything you could do from the
outside. The enemy's powers become weapons you can use against it, a kind of
turncoat armory at your disposal. It is hard for most people to imagine that
someone who outwardly plays the part of a loyal supporter or friend can secretly
be a foe. This makes your hostile intentions and maneuvers relatively easy to
cloak. When you are invisible to the enemy, there is no limit to the destructive
powers at your command.
Speak deferentially, listen respectfully, follow his command, and accord with
him in everything. He will never imagine you might be in conflict with him.
Our treacherous measures will then be settled.
--Tai Kung, Six Secret Teachings (circa fourth century B.C.)
THE FRIENDLY TAKEOVER
In the summer of 1929, Andre Breton, the thirty-three-year-old leader of Paris's
avant-garde surrealist movement, saw a private screening of a film called Un
Chien Andalou. It was directed by a Spanish member of the group, Luis Bunuel,
and its first image showed a man slicing open a woman's eye with a knife. This,
Breton exclaimed, was the first surrealist film. Un Chien Andalou generated
excitement in part because of the contribution to it of a new artist on the scene,
Salvador Dali, a friend and collaborator of Bunuel's. The director spoke highly to
Breton of his fellow Spaniard, whose paintings, he said, could certainly be
considered surrealist and whose personality was supremely peculiar. Soon
others, too, were talking about Dali, discussing what he called his "paranoid-
critical" method of painting: he delved deep into his dreams and unconscious and
interpreted the images he found there, no matter what their content, in delirious
detail. Dali still lived in Spain, but Breton was suddenly seeing his name
everywhere he went. Then, in November 1929, the twenty-five-year-old Dali had
his first major show in a Paris gallery, and Breton was transfixed by the images.
He wrote of the exhibition, "For the first time the windows of the mind had
opened wide."
The late 1920s were a difficult period for Breton. The movement he had
founded some five years earlier was stagnating, its members constantly
bickering over ideological points that bored Breton to tears. In truth, surrealism
was on the verge of becoming passe. Perhaps Dali could offer the fresh blood it
needed: his art, his ideas, and his provocative character might make surrealism
something people talked about again. With all this in mind, Breton invited Dali
into the movement, and the Spaniard happily accepted. Dali moved to Paris and
established himself there.
For the next few years, Breton's strategy seemed to be working. Dali's
scandalous paintings were the talk of Paris. His exhibitions caused riots.
Suddenly everyone was interested in surrealism again, even younger artists. But
by 1933, Breton was beginning to rue his inclusion of Dali. He had begun to get
letters from the Spaniard expressing great interest in Hitler as a source of
paranoiac inspiration. Only the surrealists, Dali felt, were capable of "saying
pretty things on the subject" of Hitler; he even wrote of sexually charged dreams
about Hitler. As news of Dali's infatuation with the Fuhrer spread within the
movement, it provoked a great deal of argument. Many surrealists had
communist sympathies and were disgusted by the Spanish artist's musings. To
make matters worse, he included in one enormous painting an image of Lenin in
a grotesque pose--exposing oversized buttocks (nine feet long), propped on a
crutch. Many in the surrealist group admired Lenin; was Dali being deliberately
provocative? After Breton told Dali he disliked this rendition of the human
buttocks and anus, a delirious profusion of anus images suddenly began to
populate the artist's paintings.
Throughout his revolutionary and missionary travels, Hasan [leader of the
Nizari Ismailis] was searching for an impregnable fortress from which to
conduct his resistance to the Seljuk empire. In about 1088, he finally chose
the castle of Alamut, built on a narrow ridge on a high rock in the heart of the
Elburz Mountains in a region known as the Rudbar. The castle dominated an
enclosed cultivated valley thirty miles long and three miles across at its
widest, approximately six thousand feet above sea level. Several villages
dotted the valley, and their inhabitants were particularly receptive to the
ascetic piety of Hasan. The castle was accessible only with the greatest
difficulty through a narrow gorge of the Alamut River.... Hasan employed a
careful strategy to take over the castle, which had been granted to its current
Shiite owner, named Mahdi, by the Seljuk sultan Malikshah. First, Hasan sent
his trusted dai Husayn Qai-ni and two others to win converts in the
neighboring villages. Next, many of the residents and soldiers of Alamut were
secretly converted to Ismailism. Finally, in September 1090, Hasan himself
was secretly smuggled into the castle. When Mahdi realized that Hasan had
in fact quietly taken over his fortress, he left peacefully....
THE TEMPLARS AND THE ASSASSINS, JAMES WASSERMAN, 2001
By early 1934, Breton could stand no more, and he issued a statement,
cosigned by several members, proposing Dali's expulsion from the surrealist
group. The movement was split down the middle; Dali had both supporters and
enemies. Finally a meeting was called to debate the issue. Dali had a fever and a
sore throat; he came to the meeting wearing half a dozen layers of clothing and
with a thermometer in his mouth. As Breton paced the room, listing the reasons
for his banishment, Dali began to take off and put on his overcoat, jacket, and
sweaters, trying to regulate his temperature. It was hard for anyone to pay
attention to Breton.
Finally Dali was asked to respond. "I had painted both Lenin and Hitler on
the basis of dreams," he said, the thermometer in his mouth making him spit
many of his words. "Lenin's anamorphic buttock was not insulting, but the very
proof of my fidelity to surrealism." He continued to put on and take off clothing.
"All taboos are forbidden, or else a list has to be made of those to be observed,
and let Breton formally state that the kingdom of surrealist poetry is nothing but
a little domain used for the house arrest of those convicted felons placed under
surveillance by the vice squad or the Communist Party."
The members of the circle were perplexed to say the least: Dali had turned
their meeting into a kind of surrealist performance, both making fun of the
creative freedom they advocated and claiming it for himself. He had also made
them laugh. A vote to exclude him would only confirm the accusations he had
leveled at them. For the time being, they decided to leave him alone, but in the
meeting's aftermath it was clear that the surrealist movement was now more
divided than ever.
At the end of that year, Dali disappeared to New York. Word came back to
Paris that he had completely conquered the art world in America, making
surrealism the hottest movement around. In the years to come, he would actually
emigrate to the United States, and his face would grace the cover of Time
magazine. From New York his fame spread far, wide, and around the world.
Meanwhile the surrealists themselves faded quietly from public view,
marginalized by other art movements. In 1939, Breton, disgusted by his lack of
control over Dali, finally expelled the Spanish artist from the group, but by then
it hardly mattered: Dali himself had become synonymous with surrealism, and it
would stay that way long after the surrealist movement had died.
Interpretation
Salvador Dali was an extremely ambitious man. Although he appeared eccentric
to say the least, his
