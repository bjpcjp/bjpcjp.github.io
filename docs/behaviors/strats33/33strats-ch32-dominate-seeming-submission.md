DOMINATE WHILE SEEMING TO SUBMIT
THE PASSIVE-AGGRESSION STRATEGY
Any attempt to bend people to your will is a form of aggression. And in a world
where political considerations are paramount, the most effective form of
aggression is the best-hidden one: aggression behind a compliant, even loving
exterior. To follow the passive-aggressive strategy, you must seem to go along
with people, offering no resistance. But actually you dominate the situation. You
are noncommittal, even a little helpless, but that only means that everything
revolves around you. Some people may sense what you are up to and get angry.
Don't worry--just make sure you have disguised your aggression enough that you
can deny it exists. Do it right and they will feel guilty for accusing you. Passive
aggression is a popular strategy; you must learn how to defend yourself against
the vast legions of passive-aggressive warriors who will assail you in your daily
life.
Gandhi and his associates repeatedly deplored the inability of their people to
give organized, effective, violent resistance against injustice and tyranny. His
own experience was corroborated by an unbroken series of reiterations from
all the leaders of India--that India could not practice physical warfare
against her enemies. Many reasons were given, including weakness, lack of
arms, having been beaten into submission, and other arguments of a similar
nature....... Confronted with the issue of what means he could employ against
the British, we come to the other criteria previously mentioned; that the kind
of means selected and how they can be used is significantly dependent upon
the face of the enemy, or the character of his opposition. Gandhi's opposition
not only made the effective use of passive resistance possible but practically
invited it. His enemy was a British administration characterized by an old,
aristocratic, liberal tradition, one which granted a good deal of freedom to its
colonials and which always had operated on a pattern of using, absorbing,
seducing, or destroying, through flattery or corruption, the revolutionary
leaders who arose from the colonial ranks. This was the kind of opposition
that would have tolerated and ultimately capitulated before the tactic of
passive resistance.
RULES FOR RADICALS, SAUL D. ALINSKY, 1971
THE GUILT WEAPON
In December 1929 the group of Englishmen who governed India were feeling a
little nervous. The Indian National Congress--the country's main independence
movement--had just broken off talks over the proposal that Britain would
gradually return autonomous rule to the subcontinent. Instead the Congress was
now calling for nothing less than immediate and total independence, and it had
asked Mahatma Gandhi to lead a civil-disobedience campaign to initiate this
struggle. Gandhi, who had studied law in London years before, had invented a
form of passive-resistant protest in 1906, while working as a barrister in South
Africa. In India in the early 1920s, he had led civil-disobedience campaigns
against the British that had created quite a stir, had landed him in prison, and had
made him the most revered man in the country. For the British, dealing with him
was never easy; despite his frail appearance, he was uncompromising and
relentless.
Although Gandhi believed in and practiced a rigorous form of nonviolence,
the colonial officers of the British Raj were fearful: at a time when the English
economy was weak, they imagined him organizing a boycott of British goods,
not to mention mass demonstrations in the streets of India's cities, a police
nightmare.
The man in charge of the Raj's strategy in combating the independence
movement was the viceroy of India, Lord Edward Irwin. Although Irwin
admired Gandhi personally, he had decided to respond to him rapidly and with
force--he could not let the situation get out of hand. He waited anxiously to see
what Gandhi would do. The weeks went by, and finally, on March 2, Irwin
received a letter from Gandhi--rather touching in its honesty--that revealed the
details of the civil-disobedience campaign he was about to launch. It was to be a
protest against the salt tax. The British held a monopoly on India's production of
salt, even though it could easily be gathered by anyone on the coast. They also
levied a rather high tax on it. This was quite a burden for the poorest of the poor
in India, for whom salt was their only condiment. Gandhi planned to lead a
march of his followers from his ashram near Bombay (present-day Mumbai) to
the coastal town of Dandi, where he would gather sea salt left on the shore by
the waves and encourage Indians everywhere to do the same. All this could be
prevented, he wrote to Irwin, if the viceroy would immediately repeal the salt
tax.
Irwin read this letter with a sense of relief. He imagined the sixty-year-old
Gandhi, rather fragile and leaning on a bamboo cane, leading his ragtag
followers from his ashram--fewer than eighty people--on a two-hundred-mile
march to the sea, where he would gather some salt from the sands. Compared to
what Irwin and his staff had been expecting, the protest seemed almost
ludicrously small in scale. What was Gandhi thinking? Had he lost touch with
reality? Even some members of the Indian National Congress were deeply
disappointed by his choice of protest. In any event, Irwin had to rethink his
strategy. It simply would not do to harass or arrest this saintly old man and his
followers (many of them women). That would look very bad. It would be better
to leave him alone, avoiding the appearance of a heavy-handed response and
letting the crisis play out and die down. In the end the ineffectiveness of this
campaign would somewhat discredit Gandhi, breaking his spell over the Indian
masses. The independence movement might fracture or at least lose some
momentum, leaving England in a stronger position in the long run.
As Irwin watched Gandhi's preparations for the march, he became still more
convinced that he had chosen the right strategy. Gandhi was framing the event as
almost religious in quality, like Lord Buddha's famous march to attain divine
wisdom, or Lord Rama's retreat in the Ramayana. His language became
increasingly apocalyptic: "We are entering upon a life-and-death struggle, a holy
war." This seemed to resonate with the poor, who began to flock to Gandhi's
ashram to hear him speak. He called in film crews from all over the world to
record the march, as if it were a momentous historical event. Irwin himself was a
religious man and saw himself as the representative of a God-fearing, civilized
nation. It would redound to England's credit to be seen to leave this saintly man
untouched on his procession to the sea.
Gandhi and his followers left their ashram on March 12, 1930. As the group
passed from village to village, their ranks began to swell. With each passing day,
Gandhi was bolder. He called on students throughout India to leave their studies
and join him in the march. Thousands responded. Large crowds gathered along
the way to see him pass; his speeches to them grew more and more
inflammatory. He seemed to be trying to bait the English into arresting him. On
April 6 he led his followers into the sea to purify themselves, then collected
some salt from the shore. Word quickly spread throughout India that Gandhi had
broken the salt law.
Irwin followed these events with increasing alarm. It dawned on him that
Gandhi had tricked him: instead of responding quickly and decisively to this
seemingly innocent march to the sea, the viceroy had left Gandhi alone, allowing
the march to gain momentum. The religious symbolism that seemed so harmless
had stirred the masses, and the salt issue had somehow become a lightning rod
for disaffection with English policy. Gandhi had shrewdly chosen an issue that
the English would not recognize as threatening but that would resonate with
Indians. Had Irwin responded by arresting Gandhi immediately, the whole thing
might have died down. Now it was too late; to arrest him at this point would
only add fuel to the fire. Yet to leave him alone would show weakness and cede
him the initiative. Meanwhile nonviolent demonstrations were breaking out in
cities and villages all over India, and to respond to them with violence would
only make the demonstrators more sympathetic to moderate Indians. Whatever
Irwin did, it seemed, would make things worse. And so he fretted, held endless
meetings, and did nothing.
It is impossible to win a contest with a helpless opponent since if you win you
have won nothing. Each blow you strike is unreturned so that all you can feel
is guilt for having struck while at the same time experiencing the uneasy
suspicion that the helplessness is calculated.
STRATEGIES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY, JAY HALEY, 1 963
In the days to come, the cause rippled outward. Thousands of Indians
traveled to India's coasts to collect salt as Gandhi had. Large cities saw mass
demonstrations in which this illegal salt was given away or sold at a minimal
price. One form of nonviolent protest cascaded into another--a Congress-led
boycott of British goods, for one. Finally, on Irwin's orders, the British began to
respond to the demonstrations with force. And on May 4 they arrested Gandhi
and took him to prison, where he would stay for nine months without trial.
Huang Ti, the legendary Yellow Emperor and reputed ancestor of the Chou
dynasty, the historical paradigm of concord and civilization, is said to have
brought harmony from chaos, tamed the barbarians and wild beasts, cleared
the forests and marshes, and invented the "five harmonious sounds," not
through an act of epic bloodshed, but through his superior virtue, by adapting
and yielding to "natural conditions" and to the Will of Heaven. Confucianism
henceforth repudiates as unworkable the idea of military solutions to human
problems. Huang Ti's most notable heir, we are told, was Ti Yao, a gentleman
who "naturally and without effort," embraced reverence, courteousness, and
intelligence. Nevertheless, during his reign, the Deluge, mythology's
universal symbol of anomie, threatened to inundate the land. Thus it fell upon
him to appoint a successor to preserve the order of his own son. Ti Yao chose
the most qualified man for the job, the venerable Shun, who had in various
tests already demonstrated a capacity to harmonize human affairs through
righteousness....... Shun in turn selected Yu the Sage to engineer an end to the
flood. Because Yu refused wine and always acted appropriately, moving with
and not resisting nature, the Way of Heaven (T'ien Tao) was revealed to him.
He subsequently harnessed the river waters not by fighting against them with
a dam, but by yielding to them and clearing for them a wider channel within
which to run. Were it not for Yu, so the story goes, who herein personified the
wisdom of both Confucius and Lao-tzu, the Taoist prophet, we would all be
fish.
RELIGIOUS MYTHOLOGY AND THE ART OF WAR, JAMES A. AHO,
1981
Gandhi's arrest sparked a conflagration of protest. On May 21 a group of
2,500 Indians marched peacefully on the government's Dharasana Salt Works,
which was defended by armed Indian constables and British officers. When the
marchers advanced on the factory, they were struck down with steel-plated clubs.
Instructed in Gandhi's methods of nonviolence, the demonstrators made no
attempt to defend themselves, simply submitting to the blows that rained down
on them. Those who had not been hit continued to march until almost every last
one had been clubbed. It was a nauseating scene that got a great deal of play in
the press. Similar incidents all over India helped to destroy the last sentimental
attachment any Indians still had toward England.
To end the spiraling unrest, Irwin was finally forced to negotiate with
Gandhi, and, on several issues, to give ground--an unprecedented event for an
English imperialist viceroy. Although the end of the Raj would take several
years, the Salt March would prove to be the beginning of the end, and in 1947
the English finally left India without a fight.
Interpretation
Gandhi was a deceptively clever strategist whose frail, even saintly appearance
constantly misled his adversaries into underestimating him. The key to any
successful strategy is to know both one's enemy and oneself, and Gandhi,
educated in London, understood the English well. He judged them to be
essentially liberal people who saw themselves as upholding traditions of political
freedom and civilized behavior. This self-image--though riddled with
contradictions, as indicated by their sometimes brutal behavior in their colonies--
was deeply important to the English. The Indians, on the other hand, had been
humiliated by many years of subservience to their English overlords. They were
largely unarmed and in no position to engage in an insurrection or guerrilla war.
If they rebelled violently, as other colonies had done, the English would crush
them and claim to be acting out of self-defense; their civilized self-image would
suffer no damage. The use of nonviolence, on the other hand--an ideal and
philosophy that Gandhi deeply valued and one that had a rich tradition in India--
would exploit to perfection the English reluctance to respond with force unless
absolutely necessary. To attack people who were protesting peacefully would not
jibe with the Englishman's sense of his own moral purity. Made to feel confused
and guilty, the English would be paralyzed with ambivalence and would
relinquish the strategic initiative.
The Salt March is perhaps the quintessential example of Gandhi's strategic
brilliance. First, he deliberately chose an issue that the British would consider
harmless, even laughable. To respond with force to a march about salt would
have given an Englishman trouble. Then, by identifying his apparently trivial
issue in his letter to Irwin, Gandhi made space for himself in which to develop
the march without fear of repression. He used that space to frame the march in
an Indian context that would give it wide appeal. The religious symbolism he
found for it had another function as well: it heightened the paralysis of the
British, who were quite religious themselves in their own way and could not
countenance repressing a spiritual event. Finally, like any good showman,
Gandhi made the march dramatically visual and used the press to give it
maximum exposure.
Once the march gained momentum, it was too late to stop it. Gandhi had
sparked a fire, and the masses were now deeply engaged in the struggle.
Whatever Irwin did at this point would make the situation worse. Not only did
the Salt March become the model for future protests, but it was clearly the
turning point in India's struggle for independence.
Many people today are as ambivalent as the English were about having
power and authority. They need power to survive, yet at the same time they have
an equally great need to believe in their own goodness. In this context to fight
people with any kind of violence makes you look aggressive and ugly. And if
they are stronger than you are, in effect you are playing into their hands,
justifying a heavy-handed response from them. Instead it is the height of
strategic wisdom to prey upon people's latent guilt and liberal ambivalence by
making yourself look benign, gentle, even passive. That will disarm them and
get past their defenses. If you take action to challenge and resist them, you must
do it morally, righteously, peacefully. If they cannot help themselves and respond
with force, they will look and feel bad; if they hesitate, you have the upper hand
and an opening to determine the whole dynamic of the war. It is almost
impossible to fight people who throw up their hands and do not resist in the
usual aggressive way. It is completely confusing and disabling. Operating in this
way, you inflict guilt as if it were a kind of weapon. In a political world, your
passive, moralistic resistance will paralyze the enemy.
I was a believer in the politics of petitions, deputations and friendly
negotiations. But all these have gone to dogs. I know that these are not the
ways to bring this Government round. Sedition has become my religion. Ours
is a nonviolent war.
--Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1947)
PASSIVE POWER
Early in 1820 a revolution broke out in Spain, followed a few months later by
one in Naples, which at that time was a city-state incorporated within the
Austrian Empire. Forced to accept liberal constitutions modeled on that of
revolutionary France some thirty years earlier, the kings of both countries had
reason to fear that they also faced the same fate as the French king of that period,
Louis XVI, beheaded in 1793. Meanwhile the leaders of Europe's great powers--
England, Austria, and Prussia--quaked at the thought of unrest and radicalism
spreading across their borders, which had only recently been stabilized by the
defeat of Napoleon. They all wanted to protect themselves and halt the tide of
revolution.
The devotion of his soldiers to him, affirmed in many stories, must be a fact.
[Julius Caesar] could not have done what he did without it. The speech in
which it is always said he quelled a mutiny with a single word, calling his
men not fellow-soldiers as was his custom, but citizens, civilians, shows a
great deal more about his methods than the mere clever use of a term. It was
a most critical moment for him. He was in Rome after Pompey's defeat, on
the point of sailing for Africa, to put down the powerful senatorial army
there. In the city he was surrounded by bitter enemies. His whole dependence
was his army, and the best and most trusted legion in it mutinied. They nearly
killed their officer; they marched to Rome and claimed their discharge; they
would serve Caesar no longer. He sent for them, telling them to bring their
swords with them, a direction perfectly characteristic of him. Everything told
of him shows his unconcern about danger to himself. Face to face with them,
he asked them to state their case and listened while they told him all they had
done and suffered and been poorly rewarded for, and demanded to be
discharged. His speech in answer was also characteristic, very gentle, very
brief, exactly to the point: "You say well, citizens. You have worked hard--you
have suffered much. You desire your discharge. You have it. I discharge you
all. You shall have your recompense. It shall never be said of me that I made
use of you when I was in danger, and was ungrateful to you when danger was
past." That was all, yet the legionaries listening were completely broken to
his will. They cried out that they would never leave him; they implored him to
forgive them, to receive them again as his soldiers. Back of the words was his
personality, and although that can never be recaptured, something of it yet
comes through the brief, bald sentences: the strength that faced tranquilly
desertion at a moment of great need; the pride that would not utter a word of
appeal or reproach; the mild tolerance of one who knew men and counted
upon nothing from them.
THE ROMAN WAY, EDITH HAMILTON, 1932
In the midst of this general unease, Czar Alexander I of Russia (1777-1825)
suddenly proposed a plan that to many seemed a cure more dangerous than the
disease. The Russian army was the largest and most feared in Europe; Alexander
wanted to send it to both Spain and Naples, crushing the two rebellions. In
exchange he would insist that the kings of both realms enact liberal reforms that
would grant their citizens greater freedoms, making them more content and
diluting their desire for revolution.
Alexander saw his proposal as more than a practical program to safeguard
Europe's monarchies; it was part of a great crusade, a dream he had nurtured
since the earliest days of his reign. A deeply religious man who saw everything
in terms of good and evil, he wanted the monarchies of Europe to reform
themselves and create a kind of Christian brotherhood of wise, gentle rulers with
himself,
