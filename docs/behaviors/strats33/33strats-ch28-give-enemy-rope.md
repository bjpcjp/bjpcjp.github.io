GIVE YOUR RIVALS ENOUGH ROPE TO HANG
THEMSELVES
THE ONE-UPMANSHIP STRATEGY
Life's greatest dangers often come not from external enemies but from our
supposed colleagues and friends, who pretend to work for the common cause
while scheming to sabotage us and steal our ideas for their gain. Although, in
the court in which you serve, you must maintain the appearance of consideration
and civility, you also must learn to defeat these people. Work to instill doubts
and insecurities in such rivals, getting them to think too much and act
defensively. Bait them with subtle challenges that get under their skin, triggering
an overreaction, an embarrassing mistake. The victory you are after is to isolate
them. Make them hang themselves through their own self-destructive tendencies,
leaving you blameless and clean.
THE ART OF ONE-UPMANSHIP
Throughout your life you will find yourself fighting on two fronts. First is the
external front, your inevitable enemies--but second and less obvious is the
internal front, your colleagues and fellow courtiers, many of whom will scheme
against you, advancing their own agendas at your expense. The worst of it is that
you will often have to fight on both fronts at once, facing your external enemies
while also working to secure your internal position, an exhausting and
debilitating struggle.
Life is war against the malice of men.
BALTASAR GRACIAN, 1601-58
The solution is not to ignore the internal problem (you will have a short life
if you do so) or to deal with it in a direct and conventional manner, by
complaining, acting aggressively, or forming defensive alliances. Understand:
internal warfare is by nature unconventional. Since people theoretically on the
same side usually do their best to maintain the appearance of being team players
working for the greater good, complaining about them or attacking them will
only make you look bad and isolate you. Yet at the same time, you can expect
these ambitious types to operate underhandedly and indirectly. Outwardly
charming and cooperative, behind the scenes they are manipulative and slippery.
You need to adopt a form of warfare suited to these nebulous yet dangerous
battles, which go on every day. And the unconventional strategy that works best
in this arena is the art of one-upmanship. Developed by history's savviest
courtiers, it is based on two simple premises: first, your rivals harbor the seeds of
their own self-destruction, and second, a rival who is made to feel defensive and
inferior, however subtly, will tend to act defensive and inferior, to his or her
detriment.
People's personalities often form around weaknesses, character flaws,
uncontrollable emotions. People who feel needy, or who have a superiority
complex, or are afraid of chaos, or desperately want order, will develop a
personality--a social mask--to cover up their flaws and make it possible for them
to present a confident, pleasant, responsible exterior to the world. But the mask
is like the scar tissue covering a wound: touch it the wrong way and it hurts.
Your victims' responses start to go out of control: they complain, act defensive
and paranoid, or show the arrogance they try so hard to conceal. For a moment
the mask falls.
When you sense you have colleagues who may prove dangerous--or are
actually already plotting something--you must try first to gather intelligence on
them. Look at their everyday behavior, their past actions, their mistakes, for
signs of their flaws. With this knowledge in hand, you are ready for the game of
one-upmanship.
Begin by doing something to prick the underlying wound, creating doubt,
insecurity, and anxiety. It might be an offhand comment or something that your
victims sense as a challenge to their position within the court. Your goal is not to
challenge them blatantly, though, but to get under their skin: they feel attacked
but are not sure why or how. The result is a vague, troubling sensation. A feeling
of inferiority creeps in.
You then follow up with secondary actions that feed their doubts. Here it is
often best to work covertly, getting other people, the media, or simple rumor to
do the job for you. The endgame is deceptively simple: having piled up enough
self-doubt to trigger a reaction, you stand back and let the target self-destruct.
You must avoid the temptation to gloat or get in a last blow; at this point, in fact,
it is best to act friendly, even offering dubious assistance and advice. Your
targets' reaction will be an overreaction. Either they will lash out, make an
embarrassing mistake, or reveal themselves too much, or they will get overly
defensive and try too hard to please others, working all too obviously to secure
their position and validate their self-esteem. Defensive people unconsciously
push people away.
At this point your opening action, especially if it is only subtly aggressive,
will be forgotten. What will stand out will be your rivals' overreaction and
humiliation. Your hands are clean, your reputation unsullied. Their loss of
position is your gain; you are one up and they are one down. If you had attacked
them directly, your advantage would be temporary or nonexistent; in fact, your
political position would be precarious: your pathetic, suffering rivals would win
sympathy as your victims, and attention would focus on you as responsible for
their undoing. Instead they must fall on their swords. You may have given them
a little help, but to whatever extent possible in their own eyes, and certainly in
everyone else's, they must have only themselves to blame. That will make their
defeat doubly galling and doubly effective.
To win without your victim's knowing how it happened or just what you
have done is the height of unconventional warfare. Master the art and not only
will you find it easier to fight on two fronts at the same time, but your path to the
highest ranks will be that much smoother.
Never interfere with an enemy that is in the process of committing suicide.
--Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)
HISTORICAL EXAMPLES
1. John A. McClernand (1812-1900) watched with envy as his friend and fellow
lawyer Abraham Lincoln rose to the U.S. presidency. McClernand, a lawyer and
congressman from Springfield, Illinois, had had this ambition himself. Shortly
after the outbreak of the Civil War, in 1861, he resigned his congressional seat to
accept a commission as a brigadier general in the Union army. He had no
military experience, but the Union needed leadership of any kind it could get,
and if he proved himself in battle, he could rise fast. He saw this army position
as his path to the presidency.
First of all, a complete definition of the technical term "one-upmanship"
would fill, and in fact has filled, a rather large encyclopedia. It can be
defined briefly here as the art of placing a person "one-down." The term
"one-down" is technically defined as that psychological state which exists in
an individual who is not "one-up" on another person.... To phrase these terms
in popular language, at the risk of losing scientific rigor, it can be said that in
any human relationship (and indeed among other mammals) one person is
constantly maneuvering to imply that he is in a "superior position" to the
other person in the relationship. This "superior position" does not necessarily
mean superior in social status or economic position; many servants are
masters at putting their employers one-down. Nor does it imply intellectual
superiority as any intellectual knows who has been put "one-down" by a
muscular garbage collector in a bout of Indian wrestling. "Superior position"
is a relative term which is continually being defined and redefined by the
ongoing relationship. Maneuvers to achieve superior position may be crude
or they may be infinitely subtle. For example, one is not usually in a superior
position if he must ask another person for something. Yet he can ask for it in
such a way that he is implying, "This is, of course, what I deserve."
THE STRATEGIES OF PSYCHOTHERAPY, JAY HALEY, 1963
McClernand's first post was at the head of a brigade in Missouri under the
overall command of General Ulysses S. Grant. Within a year he was promoted to
major general, still under Grant. But this was not good enough for McClernand,
who needed a stage for his talents, a campaign to run and get credit for. Grant
had talked to him of his plans for capturing the Confederate fort at Vicksburg, on
the Mississippi River. The fall of Vicksburg, according to Grant, could be the
turning point in the war. McClernand decided to sell a march on Vicksburg as his
own idea and use it as a springboard for his career.
In September 1862, on leave in Washington, D.C., McClernand paid a visit
to President Lincoln. He was "tired of furnishing brains" for Grant's army, he
said; he had proved himself on the battlefield and was a better strategist than
Grant, who was a little too fond of his whiskey. McClernand proposed to go
back to Illinois, where he was well known and could recruit a large army. Then
he would follow the Mississippi River south to Vicksburg and capture the fort.
Vicksburg was technically in Grant's department, but Lincoln was not sure
the general could lead the audacious attack necessary. He took McClernand to
see Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, another former lawyer, who commiserated
with his two visitors on the difficulties of dealing with military brass. Stanton
listened to and liked McClernand's plan. That October the onetime congressman
left Washington with confidential orders, giving him approval for his march on
Vicksburg. The orders were a little vague, and Grant was not informed of them,
but McClernand would make the best of them.
McClernand quickly recruited more soldiers than he had promised Lincoln
he would. He sent his recruits to Memphis, Tennessee, where he would soon join
them to march on Vicksburg. But when he arrived in Memphis, in late December
1862, the thousands of men he had recruited were not there. A telegram from
Grant--dated ten days earlier and waiting for him in Memphis--informed him
that the general was planning to attack Vicksburg. If McClernand arrived in
time, he would lead the attack; if not, his men would be led by General William
Tecumseh Sherman.
McClernand was livid. The situation had clearly been orchestrated to make it
impossible for him to arrive in time to lead his own recruits; Grant must have
figured out his plan. The general's polite telegram covering his bases made the
whole affair doubly infuriating. Well, McClernand would show him: he would
hurry downriver, catch up with Sherman, take over the campaign, and humiliate
Grant by winning the credit and honor for capturing Vicksburg.
McClernand did catch up with Sherman, on January 2, 1863, and
immediately assumed command of the army. He made an effort to be charming
to Sherman, who, he learned, had been planning to raid Confederate outposts
around Vicksburg to soften up the approach to the fort. The idea was heaven-sent
for McClernand: he would take over these raids, win battles without Grant's
name over his, earn himself some publicity, and make his command of the
Vicksburg campaign a fait accompli. He followed Sherman's plan to the letter,
and the campaign was a success.
At this triumphant point, out of the blue, McClernand received a telegram
from Grant: he was to halt operations and wait for a meeting with the general. It
was time for McClernand to play his trump card, the president; he wrote Lincoln
requesting more explicit orders, and specifically an independent command, but
he got no reply. And now vague doubts began to trouble McClernand's peace of
mind. Sherman and other officers seemed cool; somehow he had rubbed them
the wrong way. Perhaps they were conspiring with Grant to get rid of him. Grant
soon appeared on the scene with detailed plans for a campaign against Vicksburg
under his own direction. McClernand would lead a corps, which, however, was
stationed at the faraway outpost of Helena, Arkansas. Grant made a point of
treating him politely, but everything together added up to a humiliating setback.
How to be one up--how to make the other man feel that something has gone
wrong, however slightly. The Lifeman is never caddish himself, but how
simply and certainly, often, he can make the other man feel a cad, and over
prolonged periods.
THE COMPLETE UPMANSHIP, STEPHEN POTTER, 1950
Now McClernand exploded, writing letter after letter to Lincoln and Stanton
to remind them of their earlier rapport and of the support they had once given
him, and complaining bitterly about Grant. After days of fuming and writing,
McClernand finally received a response from Lincoln--and, to his shock and
dismay, the president had somehow turned against him. There had been too
many family quarrels among his generals, wrote Lincoln; for the sake of the
Union cause, McClernand should subordinate himself to Grant.
McClernand was crushed. He could not figure out what he had done or how
it had all gone wrong. Bitter and frustrated, he continued to serve under Grant
but questioned his boss's abilities to anyone who would listen, including
journalists. In June 1863, after enough negative articles had been printed, Grant
finally fired him. McClernand's military career was over, and with it his dreams
of personal glory.
Interpretation
From the moment he met John McClernand, General Grant knew he had a
troublemaker on his hands. McClernand was the type of man who thought only
of his own career--who would steal other people's ideas and plot behind their
backs for the sake of personal glory. But Grant would have to be careful:
McClernand was popular with the public, a charmer. So when Grant figured out
on his own that McClernand was trying to beat him to Vicksburg, he did not
confront him or complain. Instead he took action.
Knowing that McClernand had an oversensitive ego, Grant recognized that it
would be relatively easy to push the man's buttons. By taking over his
subordinate's recruits (technically in his department anyway) while apparently
covering his bases in the telegram, he forced McClernand into a rash response
that seemed like insubordination to other military men and made it clear how far
he was using the war for personal purposes. Once McClernand had rushed to
take his troops back from Sherman, Grant stood aside. He knew that a man like
this--vain and obnoxious--would irritate the hell out of his brother officers; they
would inevitably complain about him to Grant, who, as a responsible officer,
would have to pass the complaints upward, apparently without personal feelings
in play. Treating McClernand politely while indirectly checkmating him, Grant
finally got him to overreact in the worst possible way, with his letters to Lincoln
and Stanton. Grant knew that Lincoln was tired of squabbling within the Union
high command. While Grant could be seen working quietly to perfect his plans
for taking Vicksburg, McClernand was acting petty and throwing tantrums. The
difference between the two men was all too clear. With this battle won, Grant
repeated it, letting McClernand hang himself with his unwise complaints to the
press.
There are other ways to fray nerves. During the Gulf War, President Bush
kept pronouncing the name of the Iraqi leader as "SAD-am," which loosely
means "shoeshine boy." On Capitol Hill, the ritual mispronunciation of a
member's name is a time-tested way to rattle opponents or haze newcomers.
Lyndon Johnson was a master of the practice. When Johnson was Senate
majority leader, writes J. McIver Weatherford, he applied it with junior
members who voted the wrong way: "While slapping the young chap on the
back and telling him he understood, Johnson would break his name into
shreds as a metaphorical statement of what would happen if the disloyalty
persisted."
THE ART OF POLITICAL WARFARE, JOHN PITNEY, JR., 2000
You will often come across McClernands in your daily battles--people who
are outwardly charming but treacherous behind the scenes. It does no good to
confront them directly; they are proficient at the political game. But a subtle one-
up campaign can work wonders.
Your goal is to get these rivals to put their ambition and selfishness on
display. The way to do this is to pique their latent but powerful insecurities--
make them worry that people do not like them, that their position is unstable,
that their path to the top is not clear. Perhaps, like Grant, you can take action that
thwarts their plans in some way while hiding your own beneath a veneer of
politeness. You are making them feel defensive and disrespected. All the dark,
ugly emotions they strive so hard to hide will boil up to the surface; they will
tend to lash out, overplaying their hand. Work to make them grow emotional and
lose their habitual cool. The more they reveal of themselves, the more they will
alienate other people, and isolation will be their doom.
 
2. The Academie Francaise, founded by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635, is a highly
select body of France's forty most learned scholars, whose task it is to oversee
the purity of the French language. It was customary in the early years of the
academy that when a seat became empty, potential members would petition to
fill it, but on the occasion of a vacant seat in 1694, King Louis XIV decided to
go against protocol and nominated the bishop of Noyon. Louis's nomination
certainly made sense. The bishop was a learned man, well respected, an
excellent orator, and a fine writer.
The bishop, however, had another quality as well: an incredible sense of
self-importance. Louis was amused by this failing, but most in the court found it
downright insufferable: the bishop had a way of making almost everyone feel
inferior, in piety, erudition, family pedigree--whatever they had.
Because of his rank, for instance, the bishop was accorded the rare privilege
of being able to have his coach drive up to the front door of the royal residence,
while most others had to get out and walk from the entrance doors of the
driveway. One time the archbishop of Paris was walking along the driveway
when the bishop of Noyon passed. From his carriage the bishop waved and
signaled for the archbishop to approach him. The archbishop expected him to
alight and accompany him to the palace on foot. Instead Noyon had the carriage
slow down and continued his drive to the front door, leading the archbishop
through the window by the arm, as if he were a dog on a leash, meanwhile
chatting away superciliously. Then, once the bishop did get out of the carriage
and the two men started up the grand staircase, Noyon dropped the archbishop as
if he were nobody. Almost everyone in the court had a story like this one to tell,
and they all nursed secret grudges against the bishop.
With Louis's approval, however, it was impossible to not vote Noyon into
the academy. The king further insisted that his courtiers attend the inauguration
of the bishop, since this was his first nominee to the illustrious institution. At the
inauguration, customarily, the nominee would deliver a speech, which would be
answered by the academy's director--who at the time was a bold and witty man
called the abbe de Caumartin. The abbe could not stand the bishop but
particularly disliked his florid style of writing. De Caumartin conceived the idea
of subtly mocking Noyon: he would compose his response in perfect imitation of
the bishop, full of elaborate metaphors and gushing praise for the newest
academician. To make sure he could not get into trouble for this, he would show
his speech to the bishop beforehand. Noyon was delighted, read the text with
great interest, and even went so far as to supplement it with more effusive words
of praise and high-flying rhetoric.
On the day of the inauguration, the hall of the academy was packed with the
most eminent members of French society. (None dared incur the king's
displeasure by not attending.) The bishop appeared before them, monstrously
pleased to command this prestigious audi
