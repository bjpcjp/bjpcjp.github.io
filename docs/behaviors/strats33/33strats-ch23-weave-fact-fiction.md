PART V
UNCONVENTIONAL (DIRTY) WARFARE
A general fighting a war must constantly search for an advantage over the
opponent. The greatest advantage comes from the element of surprise, from
hitting enemies with strategies that are novel, outside their experience,
completely unconventional. It is in the nature of war, however, that over time
any strategy with any possible application will be tried and tested, so that the
search for the new and unconventional has an innate tendency to become more
and more extreme. At the same time, moral and ethical codes that governed
warfare for centuries have gradually loosened. These two effects dovetail into
what we today call "dirty war," where anything goes, down to the killing of
thousands of unwarned civilians. Dirty war is political, deceptive, and supremely
manipulative. Often the last recourse of the weak and desperate, it uses any
means available to level the playing field.
The dynamic of the dirty has filtered into society and the culture at large.
Whether in politics, business, or society, the way to defeat your opponents is to
surprise them, to come at them from an unexpected angle. And the increasing
pressures of these daily wars make dirty strategies inevitable. People go
underground: they seem nice and decent but use slippery, devious methods
behind the scenes.
The unconventional has its own logic that you must understand. First,
nothing stays new for long. Those who depend on novelty must constantly come
up with some fresh idea that goes against the orthodoxies of the time. Second,
people who use unconventional methods are very hard to fight. The classic,
direct route--the use of force and strength--does not work. You must use indirect
methods to combat indirection, fight fire with fire, even at the cost of going dirty
yourself. To try to stay clean out of a sense of morality is to risk defeat.
The chapters in this section will initiate you into the various forms of the
unorthodox. Some of these are strictly unconventional: deceiving your
opponents and working against their expectations. Others are more political and
slippery: making morality a strategic weapon, applying the arts of guerrilla
warfare to daily life, mastering the insidious forms of passive aggression. And
some are unapologetically dirty: destroying the enemy from within, inflicting
terror and panic. These chapters are designed to give you a greater understanding
of the diabolical psychology involved in each strategy, helping to arm you with
the proper defense.
WEAVE A SEAMLESS BLEND OF FACT AND
FICTION
MISPERCEPTION STRATEGIES
Since no creature can survive without the ability to see or sense what is going on
around it, you must make it hard for your enemies to know what is going on
around them, including what you are doing. Disturb their focus and you weaken
their strategic powers. People's perceptions are filtered through their emotions;
they tend to interpret the world according to what they want to see. Feed their
expectations, manufacture a reality to match their desires, and they will fool
themselves. The best deceptions are based on ambiguity, mixing fact and fiction
so that the one cannot be disentangled from the other. Control people's
perceptions of reality and you control them.
THE FALSE MIRROR
On November 3, 1943, Adolf Hitler had a document distributed to his top
generals: Directive 51, which discussed his conviction that the Allies would
invade France the following year and explained how to beat them. For years
Hitler had depended on a kind of intuition in making his most important strategic
decisions, and time and again his instincts had been right; the Allies had tried
before to make him believe that an invasion of France was imminent, but each
time Hitler had seen through the deception. This time he was not only sure that
the invasion was coming, he felt he knew exactly where it would come: the Pas
de Calais, the region of France along the English Channel that was the country's
closest point to Britain.
In war-time, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a
bodyguard of lies.
WINSTON CHURCHILL, 1874-1965
The Pas de Calais had a number of major ports, and the Allies would need a
port to land their troops. The region was also where Hitler planned to place his
V-1 and V-2 rockets, soon to be operational; with these jet-propelled unmanned
missiles so close to London, he could bomb Britain into submission. The English
knew he was putting missiles there, and that provided them yet another reason to
invade France at the Pas de Calais, before Hitler could begin his bombing
campaign.
Dudley Clarke was always clear--and a little later it will be shewn to have
been a pity that others were not equally so--that you can never, by deception,
persuade an enemy of anything not according with his own expectations,
which usually are not far removed from his hopes. It is only by using your
knowledge of them that you are able to hypnotize him, not just into thinking,
but doing what you want.
MASTER OF DECEPTION, DAVID MURE, 1980
In Directive 51, Hitler warned his commanders to expect the Allies to wage
a major deception campaign to cloak the time and place of the invasion. The
Germans had to see through these deceptions and repel the landing, and despite
recent setbacks in the German war effort, Hitler felt supremely confident they
could. Several years earlier he had commissioned the construction of the Atlantic
Wall, a line of forts up and down the coast from France to Norway, and he had
over 10 million soldiers at his disposal, a million of them in France alone. The
German armaments industry was churning out ever more and better weapons.
Hitler also controlled most of Europe, giving him enormous resources and
endless options for moving his troops here and there.
Finally, to invade France the Allies would need a massive armada, which,
once assembled, would be impossible to conceal. Hitler had infiltrated agents
into all levels of the British military, who supplied him with excellent
intelligence--they would forward to him the time and location of the invasion.
The Allies would not surprise him. And once he had defeated them on the shores
of France, England would have to sue for peace; Roosevelt would certainly lose
the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Hitler could then concentrate his entire
army against the Soviet Union and finally defeat it. In truth, the invasion of
France was the opportunity he craved to turn the war around.
Themistocles therefore had two urgent and simultaneous problems to solve.
He must take effective action, not only to block any projected withdrawal by
the Peloponnesian contingents, but also to ensure that they fought where and
when he planned that they should; and he must somehow tempt Xerxes into
making the one move which might lead to a Greek victory--that is, ordering
his fleet to attack in the Salamis channel.... The device Themistocles finally
adopted--what Plutarch calls "his celebrated trick with Sicinnus"--is one of
the most enigmatic episodes in all Greek history. Evidence for it goes back as
far as Aeschylus's Persians, performed only eight years after Salamis.... What
seems to have happened was this. At some point during the long argument
over final strategy, Themistocles, anticipating defeat, slipped away from the
conference and sent for his children's tutor, "the most faithful of his slaves,"
an Asiatic Greek named Sicinnus. This man was given a carefully prepared
message, or letter, to deliver to Xerxes, and sent off across the straits in a
small boat, probably just before dawn on 19 September.... The substance of
the message was as follows. Themistocles sent it under his own name, as
commander of the Athenian contingent: he had, he told Xerxes, changed
sides, and was now ardently desirous of a Persian victory. (No real reason is
given for this volte-face, though disgust at the attitude of the Peloponnesian
contingents would provide a strong enough motive to carry conviction.) The
Greek allies were at each other's throats, and would offer no serious
opposition--"on the contrary, you will see the pro-Persians amongst them
fighting the rest." Furthermore, they were planning a general withdrawal
from Salamis under cover of darkness, to be carried out the following night....
If Xerxes struck at once, on the divide-and-rule principle, he could forestall
such a move. "Attack them and destroy their naval power, while they are still
disorganized and before they have joined forces with their land army" [Plut.
Them. 12.4]. The conquest of the Peloponnese would then become a
comparatively simple matter. On the other hand, if Xerxes allowed the
various Greek contingents to slip through his fingers and disperse
homewards, the war might drag on indefinitely, since he would have to deal
with each separate city-state in turn. Sicinnus's arguments impressed the
Persian admirals, and they duly passed them on to the Great King himself.
Xerxes, we are told, believed the report because it "was in itself plausible"--
and also because it was just what he wanted to hear: there was trouble
brewing in Ionia and the empire, and the sooner this Greek expedition was
wound up, the better. Themistocles, always a shrewd judge of human nature,
knew very well that after so many days of delay and frustration, the Great
King would grasp at anything which seemed to offer a quick solution to his
problem.
THE GRECO-PERSIAN WARS, PETER GREEN, 1996
Hitler's commander in Western Europe was Field Marshal Gerd von
Runstedt, Germany's most respected general. To further solidify the defensive
position in France, Hitler made General Erwin Rommel the commander of the
forces along the French coast. Rommel proceeded to make improvements in the
Atlantic Wall, turning it into a "devil's garden" of minefields and fire zones.
Rommel and Runstedt also asked for more troops to ensure that the Germans
could repel the Allies at the water's edge. But the Fuhrer denied their request.
Hitler had lately come to mistrust his top staff. In the past few years, he had
survived several assassination attempts that had clearly originated among his
officers. His generals were increasingly arguing with his strategies, and in his
mind they had botched several battles in the Russian campaign; he saw many of
them as incompetents or traitors. He began to spend less time with his officers
and more time holed up in his Bavarian mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden, with
his mistress, Eva Braun, and his beloved dog, Biondi. There he pored over maps
and intelligence reports, determined to make the important decisions himself and
to manage the entire war effort more directly.
This caused a change in his way of thinking: instead of making quick,
intuitive choices, he was trying to foresee every possibility and was taking
longer to make up his mind. Now he thought Rommel and Runstedt--in their
request for more troops to be transferred to France--were being overly cautious
and even panicky. He alone would have to foil the Allied invasion; it was up to
him to see through his generals' weaknesses and the enemy's deceptions. The
only downside to this was that his workload had increased tenfold, and he was
more tired than ever. At night he took sleeping pills, by day whatever he could
get his hands on to keep him alert.
Early in 1944 key information arrived in Hitler's hands: a German agent in
Turkey stole classified documents confirming that the Allies would invade
France that year. The documents also indicated plans for an imminent invasion
of the Balkans. Hitler was particularly sensitive to any threats to the Balkans, a
valuable source of resources for Germany; a loss there would be devastating.
The threat of such an attack made it impossible to transfer troops from there to
France. Hitler's agents in England also discovered plans to invade Norway, and
here Hitler actually reinforced his troops to ward off the threat.
By April, as Hitler pored over intelligence reports, he began to feel
increasingly excited: he discerned a pattern in the enemy activity. As he had
thought, everything pointed toward an invasion of the Pas de Calais. One sign
particularly stood out: indications of an enormous army forming in southeastern
England under the command of General George Patton. This army, called
FUSAG (First United States Army Group), was clearly positioned for a crossing
to the Pas de Calais. Of all the Allies' generals, Hitler feared Patton the most. He
had proven his military skill in North Africa and Sicily. He would be the perfect
commander for the invasion.
Hitler demanded more information on Patton's army. High-flying
reconnaissance planes photographed enormous military camps, docking
equipment, thousands of tanks moving through the countryside, a pipeline being
built to the coast. When a captured German general who had been imprisoned in
England was finally repatriated, he caught glimpses of massive activity in the
FUSAG area on his trip from his internment camp to London. Agents in
Switzerland reported that every map of the Pas de Calais area had been
mysteriously bought up. The pieces of a giant puzzle were coming together.
Now only one question remained: when would it happen? As April turned to
May, Hitler was deluged with all kinds of conflicting reports, rumors, and
sightings. The information was confusing, taxing his strained mind, but two
nuggets of intelligence seemed to clarify the picture. First, a German agent in
England reported that the Allies would attack Normandy, southeast of the Pas de
Calais, between June 5 and 7. But the Germans had strong indications that this
man was operating as a double agent, and his report was clearly part of an Allied
disinformation campaign. The attack would probably be coming at the end of
June or beginning of July, when the weather was generally more predictable.
Then, later in May, a series of more reliable German spies spotted Britain's top
general, Sir Bernard Montgomery, in Gibraltar and then in Algiers. Montgomery
would certainly command a large part of any invading force. The invasion could
not be imminent if he was so far away.
On the night of June 5, Hitler pored over the maps. Maybe he was wrong--
maybe the plan was for Normandy all along. He had to consider both options; he
would not be fooled in what might be the most decisive battle of his life. The
British were tricky; he had to keep his forces mobile in case it was Normandy
after all. He would not commit himself until he knew for sure. Reading the
weather reports for the Channel--stormy that evening--he took his usual sleeping
pill and went to bed.
Early the next morning, Hitler woke to startling news: a massive invasion
was under way--in southern Normandy. A large armada had left England in the
middle of the night, and hundreds of parachutists had been dropped near the
Normandy coast. As the day progressed, the reports became more exact: the
Allies had landed on the beaches southeast of Cherbourg.
A critical moment had come. If some of the forces stationed in the Pas de
Calais were hurried to the beaches of Normandy, the Allies could be pinned and
thrown back into the sea. This was the recommendation of Rommel and
Runstedt, who anxiously awaited Hitler's approval. But through the night and
into the following day, Hitler hesitated. Then, just as he was on the verge of
sending reinforcements to Normandy, he received word of increased Allied
activity in the FUSAG area. Was Normandy in fact a giant diversion? If he
moved his reserves there, would Patton immediately cross the Channel to the Pas
de Calais? No, Hitler would wait to see if the attack was real. And so the days
went by, with Rommel and Runstedt fuming at his indecision.
After several weeks Hitler finally accepted that Normandy was the real
destination. But by then he was too late. The Allies had established a beachhead.
In August they broke out of Normandy, sending the Germans into full retreat. To
Hitler the disaster was yet another indication of the incompetence of those
around him. He had no idea how deeply and decisively he had been fooled.
 
Interpretation In trying to deceive Hitler about the Normandy invasions, the
Allies were faced with a problem: not only was the Fuhrer suspicious and wary
by nature, he knew of previous attempts to mislead him and knew that the Allies
would have to try to deceive him again. How could the Allies possibly disguise
the actual goal of a vast armada from a man who had reason to believe they
would try to mislead him and was scrutinizing their every move?
Fortunately, British intelligence had been able to provide the planners of the
D-Day landings, including Prime Minister Winston Churchill, with information
that would prove invaluable to them. First, they knew that Hitler was growing
paranoid; he was isolated and overworked, his imagination overheated. He was
prone to emotional outbursts, and he was suspicious of everyone and everything.
Second, they knew of his belief that the Allies would try to invade the Balkans
before France and that the landing site in France would be in the Pas de Calais.
He almost seemed to want these invasions to happen, as proof of his superior
reasoning powers and foresight.
Fooling Hitler into keeping his forces dispersed across Europe and France
would give the Allies a slim margin of time in which to establish a beachhead.
The key was to present him a picture, composed of many different kinds of
evidence, that would tell him the Allies were doing just what he had thought
they would. But this picture could not be made up of all kinds of flashing signs
pointing to the Balkans and the Pas de Calais--that would reek of deception.
Instead they had to create something that had the weight and feel of reality. It
had to be subtle, a mix of banal truths with little falsehoods stitched in. If Hitler
saw that in its outlines it supported his expectations, his overactive mind would
fill in the rest. This is how the Allies wove such a picture.
At the end of the war, Allied Intelligence Officers discovered in captured files
of the German Secret Service the text of two hundred and fifty messages
received from agents and other sources before D-Day. Nearly all mentioned
July and the Calais sector. One message alone gave the exact date and place
of the invasion. It had come from a French colonel in Algiers. The Allies had
discovered this officer was working for the Abwehr and he was arrested and
subsequently turned round. He too was used to mislead Berlin--used and
abused. The Germans were so often deceived by him that they ended by
treating all his information as valueless. But they kept in contact, for it is
always useful to know what the enemy wants you to believe. Allied
Intelligence, with great boldness and truly remarkable perversity, had the
colonel announce that the Invasion would take place on the coast of
Normandy on the 5th, 6th or 7th June. For the Germans, his message was
absolute proof that the invasion was to be on any day except the 5th, 6th or
7th June, and on any part of the coast except Normandy.
THE SECRETS OF D-DAY, GILLES PERRAULT, 1965
By late 1943 the British had secretly identified all of the German agents
active in England. The next step was to turn them into unwitting double agents
by feeding them false information--about Allied plans for an attack on the
Balkans and Norway, say, and the massing of a fictional army--commanded by
Patton, the American general Hitler so feared--opposite the Pas de Calais. (This
army, FUSAG, existed only in piles of phony paperwork and wireless
transmissions that mimicked a normal army.) German agents were allowed to
steal FUSAG documents and intercept transmissions--carefully misleading
messages but at the same time banal and bureaucratic ones, too banal to be seen
as fake. Working with film designers, the Allies built an elaborate set of rubber,
plastic, and wood that from German reconnaissance planes would look like an
enormous camp of tents, airplanes,
