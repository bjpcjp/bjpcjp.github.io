ENVELOP THE ENEMY
THE ANNIHILATION STRATEGY
People will use any kind of gap in your defenses to attack you or revenge
themselves on you. So offer no gaps. The secret is to envelop your opponents--
create relentless pressure on them from all sides, dominate their attention, and
close off their access to the outside world. Make your attacks unpredictable to
create a vaporous feeling of vulnerability. Finally, as you sense their weakening
resolve, crush their willpower by tightening the noose. The best encirclements
are psychological--you have surrounded their minds.
THE HORNS OF THE BEAST
In December 1878 the British declared war on the Zulus, the warrior tribe of
present-day South Africa. The rather flimsy pretext was border troubles between
Zululand and the British state of Natal; the real aim was to destroy the Zulu
army, the last remaining native force threatening British interests in the area, and
to absorb Zulu territories into a British-run confederation of states. The British
commander, Lieutenant General Lord Chelmsford, drafted a plan to invade
Zululand with three columns, the central one aimed at the capital of Ulundi, the
heart of the kingdom.
Legend has it that Shaka altered the nature of fighting in the region for ever,
by inventing a heavy, broad-bladed spear designed to withstand the stresses
of close-quarter combat. Perhaps he did: certainly both Zulu sources and the
accounts of white travellers and officials in the nineteenth century credit him
with this achievement.... His military innovations made an impact on Zulu
folklore, if nothing else, for Shaka certainly developed fighting techniques to
an unprecedented degree, and there is a wealth of stories concerning his
prowess as a warrior: he may, indeed, have been one of the great military
geniuses of his age. In place of the loose skirmishing tactics with light
throwing spears, Shaka trained his warriors to advance rapidly in tight
formations and engage hand-to-hand, battering the enemy with larger war-
shields, then skewering their foes with the new spear as they were thrown off
balance. If the results are anything to judge by, Shaka's capacity for conquest
must have been dramatic. By 1824 the Zulus had eclipsed all their rivals, and
had extended their influence over an area many times larger than their
original homeland.
THE ANATOMY OF THE ZULU ARMY, IAN KNIGHT, 1995
Many Englishmen in Natal were thrilled at the prospect of war and at the
potential benefits of taking over Zululand, but no one was as excited as forty-
eight-year-old Colonel Anthony William Durnford. For years Durnford had
bounced from one lonely British Empire outpost to another, finally ending up in
Natal. In all his years of military service, Durnford had not once seen action. He
yearned to prove his valor and worth as a soldier, but he was approaching the age
when such youthful dreams could no longer be fulfilled. Now, suddenly, the
impending war was sending the opportunity his way.
Eager to impress, Durnford volunteered to organize an elite force of native
soldiers from Natal to fight alongside the British. His offer was accepted, but as
the British invaded Zululand in early January 1879, he found himself cut out of
the main action. Lord Chelmsford did not trust him, thinking his hunger for
glory made him impetuous; also, for someone with no battle experience, he was
old. So Durnford and his company were stationed at Rorke's Drift, in western
Zululand, to help monitor the border areas with Natal. Dutifully but bitterly,
Durnford followed his orders.
In the first days after the invasion, the British failed to locate the main Zulu
army, only trickles of men here and there. They were growing frustrated. On
January 21, Chelmsford took half of the central column, which was encamped at
the foot of a mountain called Isandlwana, and led it east in search of the Zulus.
Once he had found the enemy, he would bring the rest of his army forward--but
the elusive Zulus might attack the camp while he was away, and the men at
Rorke's Drift were the closest reserves. Needing to reinforce Isandlwana, he sent
word to Durnford to bring his company there. As colonel, Durnford would now
be the highest-ranking officer at the camp, but Chelmsford could not worry
about Durnford's leadership qualities--the impending battle was the only thing on
his mind.
Early on the morning of January 22, Durnford received the news he had been
waiting for all his life. Barely able to contain his excitement, he lead his four
hundred men east to Isandlwana, arriving at the camp at around 10:00 A.M.
Surveying the land, he understood why Chelmsford had put his main camp here:
to the east and south were miles of rolling grassland--Zulus approaching from
that direction would be seen well in advance. To the north was Isandlwana, and
beyond it the plains of Nqutu. This side was a little less secure, but scouts had
been placed at key points in the plains and at the mountain passes; attack from
that direction would almost certainly be detected in time.
Shortly after his arrival, Durnford received a report that a seemingly large
Zulu force had been spotted on the plains of Nqutu heading east, perhaps to
attack Chelmsford's half of the central column from the rear. Chelmsford had left
explicit orders to keep the 1,800 men at Isandlwana together. In case of attack,
they had enough firepower to defeat the entire Zulu army--as long as they stayed
concentrated and kept their lines in order. But to Durnford it was more important
to find the main Zulu force. The British soldiers were beginning to grow edgy,
not knowing where this vaporous enemy was. The Zulus had no cavalry, and
many of them fought with spears; once their hiding place was uncovered, the rest
would be easy--the superior weaponry and discipline of the British soldiers
would prevail. Durnford thought Chelmsford was too cautious. As senior officer
at the camp, he decided to disobey orders and lead his 400 men northeast,
parallel to the plains of Nqutu, to find out what the Zulus were up to.
As Durnford marched out of the camp, a scout on the plains of Nqutu saw a
few Zulus herding cattle some four miles away. He gave chase on his horse, but
the Zulus disappeared into thin air. Riding to the point where they had vanished,
he stopped his horse just in time: below him lay a wide, deep ravine, completely
hidden from the surface of the plains, and crowded into the ravine, as far as he
could see in both directions, were Zulu warriors in full war regalia, an eerie
intensity in their eyes. They seemed to have been meditating on the imminent
battle. For a second the horseman was too stunned to move, but as hundreds of
spears were suddenly aimed at him, he turned and galloped away. The Zulus
quickly rose and began clambering out of the ravine.
Soon the other scouts on the plains saw the same terrifying sight: a wide line
of Zulus filling the horizon, some 20,000 men strong. Even from a distance, it
was clear that they were moving in formation, each end of their line coming
forward in a shape resembling horns. The scouts quickly brought word to the
camp that the Zulus were coming. By the time Durnford received the news, he
could look up to the ridge above him and see a line of Zulus streaming down the
slope. He quickly formed his own men into lines to fight them off while
retreating to the camp. The Zulus maneuvered with incredible precision. What
Durnford could not see was that the men in the left tip of the horn were moving
through the tall grass toward the rear of the camp, to link up with the other end
of the horn and complete the encirclement.
The Zulus facing Durnford and his men seemed to grow out of the earth,
emerging from behind boulders or from out of the grass in ever-greater numbers.
A knot of five or six of them would suddenly charge, throwing spears or firing
rifles, then disappear back into the grass. Whenever the British stopped to
reload, the Zulus would advance ever closer, occasionally one reaching
Durnford's lines and disemboweling a British soldier with the powerful Zulu
spear, which made an unbearable sucking sound as it went in and out.
The careful use by the Zulus of cover during their advance was observed time
and again by the British. Another anonymous survivor of Isandlwana noted
that as the Zulus crested the Nyoni ridge and came within sight of camp, they
"appeared almost to grow out of the earth. From rock and bush on the heights
above started scores of men; some with rifles, others with shields and
assegais." Lieutenant Edward Hutton of the 60th left a rather more complete
description of the Zulu army deploying for the attack at Gingindlovu: "The
dark masses of men, in open order and under admirable discipline, followed
each other in quick succession, running at a steady pace through the long
grass. Having moved steadily round so as exactly to face our front, the larger
portion of the Zulus broke into three lines, in knots and groups of from five to
ten men, and advanced towards us.... [They] continued to advance, still at a
run, until they were about 800 yards from us, when they began to open fire. In
spite of the excitement of the moment we could not but admire the perfect
manner in which these Zulus skirmished. A knot of five or six would rise and
dart through the long grass, dodging from side to side with heads down, rifles
and shields kept low and out of sight. They would then suddenly sink into the
long grass, and nothing but puffs of curling smoke would show their
whereabouts. Then they advance again...." The speed of this final advance
was terrifying. When the British gave the order to cease firing and fall back
at Isandlwana, the Zulus were pinned down some two or three hundred yards
from the British position. Lieutenant Curling of the Artillery noted that in the
time it took for his experienced men to limber his guns, the Zulus had rushed
in so quickly that one gunner had actually been stabbed as he mounted the
axle-tree seat. A Zulu veteran of the battle, uMhoti of the uKhandempemvu,
thought the final charge so swift that "like a flame the whole Zulu force
sprang to its feet and darted upon them."
THE ANATOMY OF THE ZULU ARMY, IAN KNIGHT, 1995
Durnford managed to get his men back into camp. The British were
surrounded, but they closed ranks and fired away, killing scores of Zulus and
keeping them at bay. It was like target practice: as Durnford had predicted, their
superior weaponry was making the difference. He looked around; the fight had
turned into a stalemate, and his soldiers were responding with relative
confidence. Almost imperceptibly, though, Durnford noticed a slight slackening
in their fire. Soldiers were running out of ammunition, and in the time it took
them to open a new crate and reload, the Zulus would tighten the circle and a
wave of fear would ripple through the men as here and there a soldier in the front
lines would be impaled. The Zulus fought with an intensity the British had never
seen; rushing forward as if bullets could not harm them, they seemed to be in a
trance.
Suddenly, sensing the turning point in the battle, the Zulus began to rattle
their spears against their shields and emit their war cry: "Usuthu!" It was a
terrifying din. At the northern end of the camp, a group of British soldiers gave
way--just a few, panicking at the sight and sound of the Zulus, now only a few
yards distant, but the Zulus poured through the gap. As if on cue, those in the
circle between the two horns rained spears on the British, killing many and
making havoc of their lines. From out of nowhere, a reserve force rushed
forward, fanning around the circle and doubling its squeezing power. Durnford
tried to maintain order, but it was too late: in a matter of seconds, panic. Now it
was every man for himself.
Durnford ran to the one gap in the encirclement and tried to keep it open so
that his remaining men could retreat to Rorke's Drift. Minutes later he was
impaled by a Zulu spear. Soon the battle at Isandlwana was over. A few hundred
managed to escape through the gap that Durnford had died in securing; the rest,
over fourteen hundred men, were killed.
After such a devastating defeat, the British forces quickly retreated out of
Zululand. For the time being, the war was indeed over, but not as the British had
expected.
Interpretation
A few months after the defeat at Isandlwana, the British mounted a larger
invasion and finally defeated the Zulus. But the lesson of Isandlwana remains
instructive, particularly considering the incredible discrepancy in technology.
The Zulu way of fighting had been perfected earlier in the nineteenth century
by King Shaka Zulu, who by the 1820s had transformed what had been a
relatively minor tribe into the region's greatest fighting force. Shaka invented the
heavy, broad-bladed Zulu spear, the assegai, that was so devastating in battle. He
imposed a rigorous discipline, training the Zulus to advance and encircle their
enemies with machinelike precision. The circle was extremely important in Zulu
culture--as a symbol of their national unity, a motif in their artwork, and their
dominant pattern in warfare. The Zulus could not fight for extended periods,
since their culture required lengthy cleansing rituals after the shedding of blood
in battle. During these rituals they were completely vulnerable to attack--no Zulu
could fight again, or even rejoin the tribe, until he had been cleansed. The
immense Zulu army was also costly to maintain in the field. Once mobilized,
then, the army not only had to defeat its enemies in battle, it had to annihilate
every last one of them, eliminating the possibility of a counterattack during the
vulnerable cleansing period and allowing a speedy demobilization. Encirclement
was the Zulu method of obtaining this complete kind of victory.
Before any battle, the Zulus would scout the terrain for places to hide. As
one looks out over the grasslands and plains of South Africa, they seem to offer
wide visibility, but they often conceal ravines and gullies undetectable from any
distance. Even up close, grasses and boulders provide excellent coverage. The
Zulus would move quickly to their hiding places, their feet tough as leather from
years of running over the grasslands. They would send out scouting parties as
distractions to hide the movements of the main force.
Once they emerged from their hiding place and headed into battle, the Zulus
would form what they called the "horns, chest, and loins." The chest was the
central part of the line, which would hold and pin the enemy force. Meanwhile
the horns to either side would encircle it, moving in to the sides and rear. Often
the tip of one horn would stay hidden behind tall grass or boulders; when it
emerged to complete the encirclement it would at the same time give the enemy
a nasty psychological shock. The loins were a reserve force kept back to be
thrown in for the coup de grace. These men often actually stood with their backs
to the battle, so as not to grow overly excited and rush in before the right
moment.
Years after Isandlwana a commission laid the blame for the disaster on
Durnford, but in reality it was not his fault. It was true that the British had let
themselves be surrounded, but they managed to form lines in decent order and
fought back bravely and well. What destroyed them was what destroyed every
opponent of the Zulus: the terror created by the precision of their movements,
the feeling of being encircled in an ever-tightening space, the occasional sight of
a fellow soldier succumbing to the horrible Zulu spear, the war cries, the spears
that rained down at the moment of greatest weakness, the nightmarish sight of a
reserve force suddenly joining the circle. For all the superiority of their
weaponry, the British collapsed under this calculated psychological pressure.
As soon as it grew light, Hannibal sent forward the Balearics and the other
light infantry. He then crossed the river in person and as each division was
brought across he assigned it its place in the line. The Gaulish and Spanish
horse he posted near the bank on the left wing in front of the Roman cavalry;
the right wing was assigned to the Numidian troopers. The centre consisted of
a strong force of infantry, the Gauls and Spaniards in the middle, the Africans
at either end of them.... These nations, more than any other, inspired terror by
the vastness of their stature and their frightful appearance: the Gauls were
naked above the waist, the Spaniards had taken up their position wearing
white tunics embroidered with purple, of dazzling brilliancy. The total number
of infantry in the field [at Cannae] was 40,000, and there were 10,000
cavalry. Hasdrubal was in command of the left wing, Marhabal of the right;
Hannibal himself with his brother Mago commanded the centre. It was a
great convenience to both armies that the sun shone obliquely on them,
whether it was that they purposely so placed themselves, or whether it
happened by accident, since the Romans faced the north, the Carthaginians
the south. The wind, called by the inhabitants the Vulturnus, was against the
Romans, and blew great clouds of dust into their faces, making it impossible
for them to see in front of them. When the battle [at Cannae] was raised, the
auxiliaries ran forward, and the battle began with the light infantry. Then the
Gauls and Spaniards on the left engaged the Roman cavalry on the right; the
battle was not at all like a cavalry fight, for there was no room for
maneuvering, the river on the one side and the infantry on the other hemming
them in, compelled them to fight face to face. Each side tried to force their
way straight forward, till at last the horses were standing in a closely pressed
mass, and the riders seized their opponents and tried to drag them from their
horses. It had become mainly a struggle of infantry, fierce but short, and the
Roman cavalry was repulsed and fled. Just as this battle of the cavalry was
finished, the infantry became engaged, and as long as the Gauls and
Spaniards kept their ranks unbroken, both sides were equally matched in
strength and courage. At length after long and repeated efforts the Romans
closed up their ranks, echeloned their front, and by the sheer weight of their
deep column bore down the division of the enemy which was stationed in
front of Hannibal's line, and was too thin and weak to resist the pressure.
Without a moment's pause they followed up their broken and hastily
retreating foe till they took to headlong flight. Cutting their way through to
the mass of fugitives, who offered no resistance, they penetrated as far as the
Africans who were stationed on both wings, somewhat further back than the
Gauls and Spaniards who had formed the advanced centre. As the latter fell
back, the whole front became level, and as they continued to give ground, it
became concave and crescent-shaped, the Africans at either end forming the
horns. As the Romans rushed on incautiously between them, they were
enfiladed by the two wings, which extended and closed round them in the
rear. On this, the Romans, who had fought one battle to no purpose, left the
Gauls and Spaniards, whose rear they had been slaughtering, and
commenced a fresh struggle with the Africans. The contest was a very one-
sided one, for not only were they hemmed in on all sides, but wearied with the
previous fighting they were meeting fresh and vigorous opponents.
THE HISTORY OF ROME, LIVY, 59 B.C.-A.D. 17
We humans are extremely clever creatures: in disaster or setback, we often
find a way to adapt, to turn the situation around. We look for any gap and often
find it; we thrive on hope, craftiness, and will. The history of war is littered with
stories of dramatic adjustments and reversals, except in one place: the
envelopment. Whether physical or psychological, this is the only true exception
to the possibility of turning things around.
When properly executed, this strategy gives your o
