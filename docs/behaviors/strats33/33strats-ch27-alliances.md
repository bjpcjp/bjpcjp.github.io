SEEM TO WORK FOR THE INTERESTS OF
OTHERS WHILE FURTHERING YOUR OWN
THE ALLIANCE STRATEGY
The best way to advance your cause with the minimum of effort and bloodshed is
to create a constantly shifting network of alliances, getting others to compensate
for your deficiencies, do your dirty work, fight your wars, spend energy pulling
you forward. The art is in choosing those allies who fit the needs of the moment
and fill the gaps in your power. Give them gifts, offer them friendship, help them
in time of need--all to blind them to reality and put them under subtle obligation
to you. At the same time, work to sow dissension in the alliances of others,
weakening your enemies by isolating them. While forming convenient coalitions,
keep yourself free of negative entanglements.
THE PERFECT ALLY
In 1467, Charles, the thirty-four-year-old Count of Charlois, received the news
he had secretly longed for: his father, the Duke of Burgundy--known as Philip
the Good--had died, making Charles the new duke. Father and son had clashed
over the years. Philip was patient and practical and during his reign had slowly
managed to expand Burgundy's already impressive holdings. Charles was more
ambitious and more warlike. The empire he inherited was immense, including
Flanders, Holland, Zeeland, and Luxembourg to the north of present-day France,
and the important duchy of Burgundy itself in northeastern France. Now, as
duke, Charles had the power and resources at his command to realize his dreams
of conquest into Germany and beyond.
THE DOG, THE COCK AND THE FOX
A dog and a cockerel, having made friends, were strolling along a road
together. As evening fell, the cockerel flew up into a tree to sleep there, and
the dog went to sleep at the foot of the tree, which was hollow. According to
his habit, the cockerel crowed just before daybreak. This alerted a fox nearby,
who ran up to the tree and called up to the cockerel: "Do come down, sir, for
I dearly wish to embrace a creature who could have such a beautiful voice as
you!" The cockerel said: "I shall come down as soon as you awaken the
doorkeeper who is asleep at the foot of the tree." Then, as the fox went to look
for the "doorkeeper," the dog pounced briskly on him and tore him to pieces.
This fable teaches us that sensible men, when their enemies attack them,
divert them to someone better able to defend them than they are themselves.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
Two obstacles stood in his path. The first was the independent Swiss cantons
to Burgundy's east. Charles would have to incorporate this territory, by force,
before moving into southern Germany. The Swiss were fierce warriors who
would not take kindly to any invasion. But in the end they could hardly match
the size and power of the duke's army. The second obstacle was King Louis XI
of France, Charles's cousin and archrival since childhood. France then was still a
feudal state, composed of several duchies like Burgundy, whose dukes owed
allegiance to the king. But these duchies were in fact independent powers and
could form their own league if the king dared provoke them. Burgundy was the
most powerful duchy of them all, and everyone knew Louis dreamed of
swallowing it up and making France a united power.
Charles, however, felt confident that he could best his older cousin in both
diplomacy and warfare. After all, Louis was weak, even a little soft in the head.
How else to explain his strange infatuation with the Swiss cantons? Almost from
the beginning of his reign, Louis had courted them assiduously, treating them
almost like equals to France. There were many more powerful states he could
have allied himself with to increase France's power, but he seemed obsessed with
the Swiss. Perhaps he felt an affinity to their simple lifestyle; for a king, he
himself had rather peasant tastes. Louis also had an aversion toward warfare,
preferring to buy peace, even at a high price, than to fund an army.
It was imperative that Charles strike now, before Louis wised up and started
acting more like a king. Charles formed a plan to realize his ambitions and then
some: he would first move into Alsace, between France and Germany, and
swallow up the weak kingdoms in the area. Then he would form an alliance with
the great warrior king of England, Edward IV, whom he would persuade to land
a large army at Calais. His own army would link up with the English at Reims,
in central France, where Edward would be crowned the country's new king. The
duke and Edward would easily dispose of Louis's weak army. The duke could
then march east, across the Swiss cantons, while Edward would march south.
Together they would form the dominant power in Europe.
By 1474 everything was in place. Edward had signed on to the plan. The
duke began by marching on the upper Rhine, but just as he began his maneuvers,
he learned that a large Swiss army had invaded his home territory of Burgundy.
This army was funded by Louis XI himself. By this action Louis and the Swiss
were clearly sending a warning to the duke that they would not look kindly on
any future invasion of the cantons, but Charles had enough forces in Burgundy
to drive the Swiss out. He was not a man to provoke in such a way; both parties
would more than pay for their rash invasion.
In the summer of 1475, the English army--the largest yet assembled for an
invasion of France--landed at Calais under the personal leadership of Edward IV.
Charles went to meet Edward to finalize their plans and toast their imminent
conquests. He then quickly returned to his own troops, which were marching
south through Lorraine in preparation for the great linkup with the English forces
at Reims.
Suddenly some disturbing news reached Charles in the field: his spies at the
French court reported that Louis had opened up secret negotiations with Edward.
Apparently Louis had persuaded the English king that Charles was using him
and could not be trusted. Knowing that England's finances were weak, Louis had
offered generous terms of peace, amounting to a large annual pension paid
directly to the king and his court. He had entertained the English with great
feasts of food and ale. And then, to the duke's utter disgust and amazement,
Edward fell for it, signed the treaty, and took his forces home.
The duke had barely had time to get over this bitter news when Louis
suddenly sent him envoys to broker a long-term truce between France and
Burgundy. This was typical of the king--everything he did was inconsistent and
contradictory. What was he thinking? Signing the truce would mean the duke
could now confidently march against the Swiss, knowing that France would not
interfere. Perhaps the king was guided by his great fear of war? Charles happily
approved the truce.
The Swiss were outraged: Louis had been their friend, and now, at the
moment of imminent peril, he had abandoned them. But the Swiss were used to
fighting on their own; they would simply have to mobilize every man available.
Since in all her decisions, whether by chance or by choice, Rome took all
steps necessary to make herself great, she did not overlook fraud. She could
not at the start have been more deceitful than she was in the means she took,
as we were saying just now, to acquire allies, since under this title she made
them all her servants, as was the case with the Latins and other peoples
round about. For she first availed herself of their arms in order to subjugate
neighbouring peoples and to build up her reputation as a state, and then,
having subdued them, she increased to such an extent that she could beat
anyone. Nor would the Latins ever have realised that in reality they were
mere slaves, if they had not seen the Samnites twice defeated and forced to
accept Rome's terms.
THE DISCOURSES, NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI, 1520
In the dead of the winter of 1477, the duke, impatient for victory, crossed the
Jura Mountains heading east. The Swiss were waiting for him near the town of
Grandson. This was the first time the duke had done battle with the Swiss, and
he was caught off guard by what confronted him. It began with the alarming
bellow of Swiss battle horns, which echoed in the mountains, creating a
frightening din. Next, thousands of Swiss soldiers advanced down the slope
toward the Burgundians. They marched with perfect precision, packed tight in
phalanxes from which their enormous pikes stuck out like the spines of a giant
hedgehog in motion. Their flanks and rear were protected by halberdiers
swinging spiked battle-axes. It was a terrifying sight. The duke ordered attack
after attack with his cavalry to break up the phalanxes, only to watch them being
slaughtered. His artillery was hard to maneuver in the mountainous terrain. The
Swiss fought with incredible fierceness, and their phalanxes were impenetrable.
A reserve Swiss force, hidden in the woods on the Burgundian right,
suddenly emerged and attacked. The duke's army fell into a headlong retreat; the
battle ended in a slaughter, from which the duke, however, escaped.
A few months later, it was the turn of the Swiss to go on the offensive by
marching into Lorraine. In January 1478 the duke counterattacked with his now
enfeebled forces; again the Burgundians were routed, and this time the duke did
not escape. His body was finally identified on the field of battle, his head cloven
in two by a Swiss halberd, his body pierced by pikes.
In the months after Charles's death, Louis XI swallowed up Burgundy,
eliminating the last great feudal threat to a unified France. The duke had
unknowingly fallen prey to Louis's elaborate plan to destroy him without
wasting a single French soldier.
Six in the third place means: He finds a comrade. Now he beats the drum,
now he stops. Now he sobs, now he sings. Here the source of a man's strength
lies not in himself but in his relation to other people. No matter how close to
them he may be, if his center of gravity depends on them, he is inevitably
tossed to and fro between joy and sorrow. Rejoicing to high heaven, then sad
unto death--this is the fate of those who depend upon an inner accord with
other persons whom they love....

Interpretation
King Louis XI would eventually become known as the Spider King, infamous
for the elaborate webs he would weave to ensnare his opponents. His genius was
to think far ahead and plot an indirect path to his goals--and his greatest goal was
to transform France from a feudal state into a unified great power. Burgundy was
his largest obstacle, and one he could not meet head-on: his army was weaker
than Charles's, and he did not want to provoke a civil war. Before he became
king, though, Louis had fought a short campaign against the Swiss and had seen
the brutal efficiency with which their phalanxes fought and how they used their
mountainous terrain to perfect advantage. He thought them unbeatable in war.
Louis formed a plan to bait Charles into invading the cantons, where his military
machine would be destroyed.
The strands of Louis's web were finely woven. First, he spent years courting
the Swiss, forging bonds that blinded them to his ulterior purpose. This alliance
also befuddled the arrogant duke, who could not imagine how Louis planned to
make use of such an ally. The king also knew that by getting the Swiss to invade
Burgundy in 1474, he would make the duke so enraged as to lose all patience in
his desire for revenge.
When Edward landed at Calais, the king had foreseen the invasion and was
ready for it. Instead of trying to fight off this mighty opponent, he worked to
coax the English king away from his alliance with Burgundy by appealing to his
self-interest: without risking a single battle so far from home, Edward would
receive a financial payment too handsome to refuse. Again thinking far in
advance, Louis knew that when he eventually swallowed up the wealthy duchy
of Burgundy, he would more than recoup what he was having to pay Edward.
Abandoned by the English, Charles was isolated, yet still determined to avenge
the invasion of Burgundy. At this point Louis moved to sign a treaty with the
duke, getting rid of the last possible obstacle in Charles's path to the Swiss
cantons. This new treaty would infuriate his Swiss friends, but what did Louis
care? Friendship meant little to him; the Swiss would fight to defend their land
with or without him. Patient and clear about his goals, Louis used alliances as a
form of bloodless warfare, crushing his opponents by getting others to do his
work for him.
Almost all of us instinctively understand the importance of allies. Because
we operate by feel and emotion more often than by strategy, however, we
frequently make the worst kinds of alliances. A common mistake is to think that
the more allies we have, the better; but quality is more important than quantity.
Having numerous allies increases the chances we will become entangled in other
people's wars. Going to the other extreme, we sometimes think a single powerful
ally is all we need; but allies like that tend to get what they can from us and then
drop us when our usefulness is exhausted, just as Louis dropped the Swiss. It is
in any case a mistake to become dependent on one person. Finally, we
sometimes choose those who seem the friendliest, who we think will be loyal.
Our emotions lead us astray.
THE FOX AND THE BILLY-GOAT
A fox, having fallen into a well, was faced with the prospect of being stuck
there. But then a billy-goat came along to that same well because he was
thirsty and saw the fox. He asked him if the water was good. The fox decided
to put a brave face on it and gave a tremendous speech about how wonderful
the water was down there, so very excellent. So the billy-goat climbed down
the well, thinking only of his thirst. When he had a good drink, he asked the
fox what he thought was the best way to get back up again. The fox said:
"Well, I have a very good way to do that. Of course, it will mean our working
together. If you just push your front feet up against the wall and hold your
horns up in the air as high as you can, I will climb up on to them, get out, and
then I can pull you up behind me." The billy-goat willingly consented to this
idea, and the fox briskly clambered up the legs, the shoulders, and finally the
horns of his companion. He found himself at the mouth of the well, pulled
himself out, and immediately scampered off. The billy-goat shouted after him,
reproaching him for breaking their agreement of mutual assistance....
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
Understand: the perfect allies are those who give you something you cannot
get on your own. They have the resources you lack. They will do your dirty
work for you or fight your battles. Like the Swiss, they are not always the most
obvious or the most powerful. Be creative and look for allies to whom you in
turn have something to offer as well, creating a link of self-interest. To lose such
allies of convenience will not destroy you or make you feel betrayed. You must
think of them as temporary tools. When you no longer need such tools, there is
no love lost in dumping them.
The forces of a powerful ally can be useful and good to those who have
recourse to them...but are perilous to those who become dependent on them.
--Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince (1513)
FALSE ALLIANCES
In November 1966, Murray Bowen, a professor of clinical psychiatry at
Georgetown University and one of the world's most influential family therapists,
faced a brewing crisis within his own family back home in Waverly, Tennessee.
Bowen was the oldest of five children. His family had operated an important
business in Waverly for several generations. The third-oldest sibling, a brother
nicknamed June, had been running the business for some time. Continually
overworked and feeling under-appreciated, June was now asking for a
controlling interest in the business. Their father supported him, their mother did
not. Members of the extended family were taking sides. The situation was tense.
At the same time, a death in the family of June's wife had made her so
despondent that it was beginning to affect her husband's health. A ripple effect
was spreading to the rest of the family, and Bowen's sister, the second-youngest
and most unstable sibling, was beginning to display all kinds of nervous
symptoms. Bowen feared most, though, for his father, who had a weak heart. As
a family therapist, Bowen had studied a phenomenon he called an "anxiety
wave," in which a peripheral event could spark enough emotional turmoil to lead
to the death of the family's oldest or most vulnerable member. Somehow Bowen
had to find a way to defuse this anxiety wave in his own family.
Heracles had performed these Ten Labours in the space of eight years and
one month; but Eurystheus, discounting the Second and the Fifth, set him two
more. The Eleventh Labour was to fetch fruit from the golden apple-tree,
Mother Earth's wedding gift to Hera, with which she had been so delighted
that she planted it in her own divine garden. This garden lay on the slopes of
Mount Atlas, where the panting chariot-horses of the Sun complete their
journey, and where Atlas's sheep and cattle, one thousand herds of each,
wander over their undisputed pastures. When Hera found, one day, that
Atlas's daughters, the Hesperides, to whom she had entrusted the tree, were
pilfering the apples, she set the ever-watchful dragon Ladon to coil around
the tree as its guardian....... When at last Heracles came to the Po, the river-
nymphs, daughters of Zeus and Themis, showed him Nereus asleep. He seized
the hoary old sea-god and, clinging to him despite his many Protean changes,
forced him to prophesy how the golden apples could be won....... Nereus had
advised Heracles not to pluck the apples himself, but to employ Atlas as his
agent, meanwhile relieving him of his fantastic burden; therefore, on arriving
at the Garden of the Hesperides, he asked Atlas to do him this favor. Atlas
would have undertaken almost any task for the sake of an hour's respite, but
he feared Ladon, whom Heracles thereupon killed with an arrow shot over
the garden wall. Heracles now bent his back to receive the weight of the
celestial globe, and Atlas walked away, returning presently with three apples
plucked by his daughters. He found the sense of freedom delicious. "I will
take these apples to Eurystheus myself without fail," he said, "if you hold up
the heavens for a few moments longer." Heracles pretended to agree, but,
having been warned by Nereus not to accept any such offer, begged Atlas to
support the globe for only one moment more, while he put a pad on his head.
Atlas, easily deceived, laid the apples on the ground and resumed his burden;
whereupon Heracles picked them up and went away with an ironical farewell.
THE GREEK MYTHS, VOL. 2, ROBERT GRAVES, 1955
The problem for Bowen was that he was also going through a kind of
personal and professional crisis at the time. One of his most influential theories
held that members of a family were healthy to the extent that they could
differentiate themselves from their siblings and parents, establishing their own
identity, being able to make decisions on their own, while also being integrated
and actively involved with the rest of the family. He saw this as a difficult
psychic task for anyone. A family has a kind of group ego and an interlocking
emotional network; it requires a great deal of effort and practice to establish
autonomy outside this system. Yet doing so, Bowen believed, though crucial for
everyone, was also professionally necessary for family therapists, who could not
properly help others if they had been unable to differentiate themselves from
their own families. They would carry their personal problems into their practice.
And indeed here was Professor Bowen, a man in his early fifties who had
worked for years on his relationship to his family but who found himself sucked
into the group dynamic, regr
