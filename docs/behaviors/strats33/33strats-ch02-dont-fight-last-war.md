DO NOT FIGHT THE LAST WAR
THE GUERRILLA-WAR-OF-THE-MIND STRATEGY
What most often weighs you down and brings you misery is the past, in the form
of unnecessary attachments, repetitions of tired formulas, and the memory of old
victories and defeats. You must consciously wage war against the past and force
yourself to react to the present moment. Be ruthless on yourself; do not repeat
the same tired methods. Sometimes you must force yourself to strike out in new
directions, even if they involve risk. What you may lose in comfort and security,
you will gain in surprise, making it harder for your enemies to tell what you will
do. Wage guerrilla war on your mind, allowing no static lines of defense, no
exposed citadels--make everything fluid and mobile.
Theory cannot equip the mind with formulas for solving problems, nor can it
mark the narrow path on which the sole solution is supposed to lie by
planting a hedge of principles on either side. But it can give the mind insight
into the great mass of phenomena and of their relationships, then leave it free
to rise into the higher realms of action. There the mind can use its innate
talents to capacity, combining them all so as to seize on what is right and true
as though this were a single idea formed by their concentrated pressure--as
though it were a response to the immediate challenge rather than a product of
thought.
ON WAR, CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
THE LAST WAR
No one has risen to power faster than Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821). In 1793
he went from captain in the French revolutionary army to brigadier general. In
1796 he became the leader of the French force in Italy fighting the Austrians,
whom he crushed that year and again three years later. He became first consul of
France in 1801, emperor in 1804. In 1805 he humiliated the Austrian and
Russian armies at the Battle of Austerlitz.
For many, Napoleon was more than a great general; he was a genius, a god
of war. Not everyone was impressed, though: there were Prussian generals who
thought he had merely been lucky. Where Napoleon was rash and aggressive,
they believed, his opponents had been timid and weak. If he ever faced the
Prussians, he would be revealed as a great fake.
Among these Prussian generals was Friedrich Ludwig, prince of Hohenlohe-
Ingelfingen (1746-1818). Hohenlohe came from one of Germany's oldest
aristocratic families, one with an illustrious military record. He had begun his
career young, serving under Frederick the Great (1712-86) himself, the man who
had single-handedly made Prussia a great power. Hohenlohe had risen through
the ranks, becoming a general at fifty--young by Prussian standards.
To Hohenlohe success in war depended on organization, discipline, and the
use of superior strategies developed by trained military minds. The Prussians
exemplified all of these virtues. Prussian soldiers drilled relentlessly until they
could perform elaborate maneuvers as precisely as a machine. Prussian generals
intensely studied the victories of Frederick the Great; war for them was a
mathematical affair, the application of timeless principles. To the generals
Napoleon was a Corsican hothead leading an unruly citizens' army. Superior in
knowledge and skill, they would outstrategize him. The French would panic and
crumble in the face of the disciplined Prussians; the Napoleonic myth would lie
in ruins, and Europe could return to its old ways.
In August 1806, Hohenlohe and his fellow generals finally got what they
wanted: King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia, tired of Napoleon's broken
promises, decided to declare war on him in six weeks. In the meantime he asked
his generals to come up with a plan to crush the French.
Hohenlohe was ecstatic. This campaign would be the climax of his career.
He had been thinking for years about how to beat Napoleon, and he presented
his plan at the generals' first strategy session: precise marches would place the
army at the perfect angle from which to attack the French as they advanced
through southern Prussia. An attack in oblique formation--Frederick the Great's
favorite tactic--would deliver a devastating blow. The other generals, all in their
sixties and seventies, presented their own plans, but these too were merely
variants on the tactics of Frederick the Great. Discussion turned into argument;
several weeks went by. Finally the king had to step in and create a compromise
strategy that would satisfy all of his generals.
He [Baron Antoine-Henri de Jomini] --often quite arbitrarily--presses [the
deeds of Napoleon] into a system which he foists on Napoleon, and, in doing
so, completely fails to see what, above all, really constitutes the greatness of
this captain--namely, the reckless boldness of his operations, where, scoffing
at all theory, he always tried to do what suited each occasion best.
FRIEDRICH VON BERNHARDI, 1849-1930
A feeling of exuberance swept the country, which would soon relive the
glory years of Frederick the Great. The generals realized that Napoleon knew
about their plans--he had excellent spies--but the Prussians had a head start, and
once their war machine started to move, nothing could stop it.
On October 5, a few days before the king was to declare war, disturbing
news reached the generals. A reconnaissance mission revealed that divisions of
Napoleon's army, which they had believed was dispersed, had marched east,
merged, and was massing deep in southern Prussia. The captain who had led the
scouting mission reported that the French soldiers were marching with packs on
their backs: where the Prussians used slow-moving wagons to provision their
troops, the French carried their own supplies and moved with astonishing speed
and mobility.
Before the generals had time to adjust their plans, Napoleon's army suddenly
wheeled north, heading straight for Berlin, the heart of Prussia. The generals
argued and dithered, moving their troops here and there, trying to decide where
to attack. A mood of panic set in. Finally the king ordered a retreat: the troops
would reassemble to the north and attack Napoleon's flank as he advanced
toward Berlin. Hohenlohe was in charge of the rear guard, protecting the
Prussians' retreat.
On October 14, near the town of Jena, Napoleon caught up with Hohenlohe,
who finally faced the battle he had wanted so desperately. The numbers on both
sides were equal, but while the French were an unruly force, fighting pell-mell
and on the run, Hohenlohe kept his troops in tight order, orchestrating them like
a corps de ballet. The fighting went back and forth until finally the French
captured the village of Vierzehnheiligen.
Hohenlohe ordered his troops to retake the village. In a ritual dating back to
Frederick the Great, a drum major beat out a cadence and the Prussian soldiers,
their colors flying, reformed their positions in perfect parade order, preparing to
advance. They were in an open plain, though, and Napoleon's men were behind
garden walls and on the house roofs. The Prussians fell like ninepins to the
French marksmen. Confused, Hohenlohe ordered his soldiers to halt and change
formation. The drums beat again, the Prussians marched with magnificent
precision, always a sight to behold--but the French kept shooting, decimating the
Prussian line.
Never had Hohenlohe seen such an army. The French soldiers were like
demons. Unlike his disciplined soldiers, they moved on their own, yet there was
method to their madness. Suddenly, as if from nowhere, they rushed forward on
both sides, threatening to surround the Prussians. The prince ordered a retreat.
The Battle of Jena was over.
Like a house of cards, the Prussians quickly crumbled, one fortress falling
after another. The king fled east. In a matter of days, virtually nothing remained
of the once mighty Prussian army.
THE BAT AND THE HOUSE-FERRETS
A bat fell to the ground and was caught by a house-ferret. Realizing that she
was on the point of being killed, she begged for her life. The house-ferret said
to her that she couldn't let her go, for ferrets were supposed to be natural
enemies to all birds. The bat replied that she herself was not a bird, but a
mouse. She managed to extricate herself from her danger by this means.
Eventually, falling a second time, the bat was caught by another house-ferret.
Again she pleaded to the ferret not to eat her. The second ferret declared that
she absolutely detested all mice. But the bat positively affirmed that she was
not a mouse but a bat. And so she was released again. And that was how she
saved herself from death twice by a mere change of name. This fable shows
that it is not always necessary to confine ourselves to the same tactics. But,
on the contrary, if we are adaptable to circumstances we can better escape
danger.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
Interpretation
The reality facing the Prussians in 1806 was simple: they had fallen fifty years
behind the times. Their generals were old, and instead of responding to present
circumstances, they were repeating formulas that had worked in the past. Their
army moved slowly, and their soldiers were automatons on parade. The Prussian
generals had many signs to warn them of disaster: their army had not performed
well in its recent engagements, a number of Prussian officers had preached
reform, and, last but not least, they had had ten years to study Napoleon--his
innovative strategies and the speed and fluidity with which his armies converged
on the enemy. Reality was staring them in the face, yet they chose to ignore it.
Indeed, they told themselves that Napoleon was the one who was doomed.
You might find the Prussian army just an interesting historical example, but
in fact you are likely marching in the same direction yourself. What limits
individuals as well as nations is the inability to confront reality, to see things for
what they are. As we grow older, we become more rooted in the past. Habit takes
over. Something that has worked for us before becomes a doctrine, a shell to
protect us from reality. Repetition replaces creativity. We rarely realize we're
doing this, because it is almost impossible for us to see it happening in our own
minds. Then suddenly a young Napoleon crosses our path, a person who does
not respect tradition, who fights in a new way. Only then do we see that our
ways of thinking and responding have fallen behind the times.
Never take it for granted that your past successes will continue into the
future. Actually, your past successes are your biggest obstacle: every battle,
every war, is different, and you cannot assume that what worked before will
work today. You must cut yourself loose from the past and open your eyes to the
present. Your tendency to fight the last war may lead to your final war.
When in 1806 the Prussian generals...plunged into the open jaws of disaster
by using Frederick the Great's oblique order of battle, it was not just a case
of a style that had outlived its usefulness but the most extreme poverty of the
imagination to which routine has ever led. The result was that the Prussian
army under Hohenlohe was ruined more completely than any army has ever
been ruined on the battlefield.
--Carl von Clausewitz, ON WAR (1780-1831)
THE PRESENT WAR
In 1605, Miyamoto Musashi, a samurai who had made a name for himself as a
swordsman at the young age of twenty-one, was challenged to a duel. The
challenger, a young man named Matashichiro, came from the Yoshioka family, a
clan itself renowned for swordsmanship. Earlier that year Musashi had defeated
Matashichiro's father, Genzaemon, in a duel. Days later he had killed
Genzaemon's younger brother in another duel. The Yoshioka family wanted
revenge.
I never read any treatises on strategy.... When we fight, we do not take any
books with us.
MAO TSE-TUNG, 1893-1976
Musashi's friends smelled a trap in Matashichiro's challenge and offered to
accompany him to the duel, but Musashi went alone. In his earlier fights with the
Yoshiokas, he had angered them by showing up hours late; this time, though, he
came early and hid in the trees. Matashichiro arrived with a small army. Musashi
would "arrive way behind schedule as usual," one of them said, "but that trick
won't work with us anymore!" Confident in their ambush, Matashichiro's men
lay down and hid in the grass. Suddenly Musashi leaped out from behind his tree
and shouted, "I've been waiting long enough. Draw your sword!" In one swift
stroke, he killed Matashichiro, then took a position at an angle to the other men.
All of them jumped to their feet, but they were caught off guard and startled, and
instead of surrounding him, they stood in a broken line. Musashi simply ran
down the line, killing the dazed men one after another in a matter of seconds.
Musashi's victory sealed his reputation as one of Japan's greatest swordsmen.
He now roamed the country looking for suitable challenges. In one town he
heard of an undefeated warrior named Baiken whose weapons were a sickle and
a long chain with a steel ball at the end of it. Musashi wanted to see these
weapons in action, but Baiken refused: the only way he could see them work,
Baiken said, was by fighting a duel.
REFRESHING THE MIND When you and your opponent are engaged in
combat which is dragging on with no end in sight, it is crucial that you
should come up with a completely different technique. By refreshing your
mind and techniques as you continue to fight your opponent, you will find an
appropriate rhythm-timing with which to defeat him. Whenever you and your
opponent become stagnant, you must immediately employ a different method
of dealing with him in order to overcome him.
THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS, MIYAMOTO MUSASHI, 1584-1645
Once again Musashi's friends chose the safe route: they urged him to walk
away. No one had come close to defeating Baiken, whose weapons were
unbeatable: swinging his ball in the air to build up momentum, he would force
his victim backward with a relentless charge, then hurl the ball at the man's face.
His opponent would have to fend off the ball and chain, and while his sword arm
was occupied, in that brief instant Baiken would slash him with the sickle across
his neck.
Ignoring the warnings of his friends, Musashi challenged Baiken and
showed up at the man's tent with two swords, one long, one short. Baiken had
never seen someone fight with two swords. Also, instead of letting Baiken
charge him, Musashi charged first, pushing his foe back on his heels. Baiken
hesitated to throw the ball, for Musashi could parry it with one sword and strike
him with the other. As he looked for an opening, Musashi suddenly knocked him
off balance with a blow of the short sword and then, in a split second, followed
with a thrust of the long one, stabbing him through and killing the once
undefeated master Baiken.
A few years later, Musashi heard about a great samurai named Sasaki
Ganryu, who fought with a very long sword--a startlingly beautiful weapon,
which seemed possessed of some warlike spirit. This fight would be Musashi's
ultimate test. Ganryu accepted his challenge; the duel would take place on a little
island near the samurai's home.
It is a disease to be obsessed by the thought of winning. It is also a disease to
be obsessed by the thought of employing your swordsmanship. So it is to be
obsessed by the thought of using everything you have learned, and to be
obsessed by the thought of attacking. It is also a disease to be obsessed and
stuck with the thought of ridding yourself of any of these diseases. A disease
here is an obsessed mind that dwells on one thing. Because all these diseases
are in your mind, you must get rid of them to put your mind in order.
TAKUAN, JAPAN, 1573-1645
On the morning of the duel, the island was packed. A fight between such
warriors was unprecedented. Ganryu arrived on time, but Musashi was late, very
late. An hour went by, then two; Ganryu was furious. Finally a boat was spotted
approaching the island. Its passenger was lying down, half asleep, it seemed,
whittling at a long wooden oar. It was Musashi. He seemed lost in thought,
staring into the clouds. When the boat came to shore, he tied a dirty towel
around his head and jumped out of the boat, brandishing the long oar--longer
than Ganryu's famous sword. This strange man had come to the biggest fight of
his life with an oar for a sword and a towel for a headband.
Ganryu called out angrily, "Are you so frightened of me that you have
broken your promise to be here by eight?" Musashi said nothing but stepped
closer. Ganryu drew his magnificent sword and threw the sheath onto the sand.
Musashi smiled: "Sasaki, you have just sealed your doom." "Me? Defeated?
Impossible!" "What victor on earth," replied Musashi, "would abandon his
sheath to the sea?" This enigmatic remark only made Ganryu angrier.
Then Musashi charged, aiming his sharpened oar straight for his enemy's
eyes. Ganryu quickly raised his sword and struck at Musashi's head but missed,
only cutting the towel headband in two. He had never missed before. In almost
the same instant, Musashi brought down his wooden sword, knocking Ganryu
off his feet. The spectators gasped. As Ganryu struggled up, Musashi killed him
with a blow to the head. Then, after bowing politely to the men officiating over
the duel, he got back into the boat and left as calmly as he had arrived.
From that moment on, Musashi was considered a swordsman without peer.
Anyone can plan a campaign, but few are capable of waging war, because
only a true military genius can handle the developments and circumstances.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821
Interpretation
Miyamoto Musashi, author of The Book of Five Rings, won all his duels for one
reason: in each instance he adapted his strategy to his opponent and to the
circumstances of the moment. With Matashichiro he decided it was time to
arrive early, which he hadn't done in his previous fights. Victory against superior
numbers depended on surprise, so he leaped up when his opponents lay down;
then, once he had killed their leader, he set himself at an angle that invited them
to charge at him instead of surrounding him, which would have been much more
dangerous for him. With Baiken it was simply a matter of using two swords and
then crowding his space, giving him no time to react intelligently to this novelty.
With Ganryu he set out to infuriate and humiliate his haughty opponent--the
wooden sword, the nonchalant attitude, the dirty-towel headband, the enigmatic
remark, the charge at the eyes.
Musashi's opponents depended on brilliant technique, flashy swords, and
unorthodox weapons. That is the same as fighting the last war: instead of
responding to the moment, they relied on training, technology, and what had
worked before. Musashi, who had grasped the essence of strategy when he was
still very young, turned their rigidity into their downfall. His first thought was of
the gambit that would take this particular opponent most by surprise. Then he
would anchor himself in the moment: having set his opponent off balance with
something unexpected, he would watch carefully, then respond with another
action, usually improvised, that would turn mere disequilibrium into defeat and
death.
Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION. Thus the superior man stands
firm And does not change his direction. Thunder rolls, and the wind blows;
both are examples of extreme mobility and so are seemingly the very opposite
of duration, but the laws governing their appearance and subsidence, their
coming and going, endure. In the same way the independence of the superior
man is not based on rigidity and immobility of character. He always keeps
abreast of the time and changes with it. What endures is the unswerving
directive, the inner law of his being, which determines all his actions.
 
THE I CHING, CHINA, CIRCA EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.
In preparing yourself for war, you must rid yourself of myths and
misconceptions. Strategy is not a question of learning a series of moves or ideas
to f
