KNOW HOW TO END THINGS
THE EXIT STRATEGY
You are judged in this world by how well you bring things to an end. A messy or
incomplete conclusion can reverberate for years to come, ruining your
reputation in the process. The art of ending things well is knowing when to stop,
never going so far that you exhaust yourself or create bitter enemies that embroil
you in conflict in the future. It also entails ending on the right note, with energy
and flair. It is not a question of simply winning the war but the way you win it,
the way your victory sets you up for the next round. The height of strategic
wisdom is to avoid all conflicts and entanglements from which there are no
realistic exits.
NO EXIT
For the most senior members of the Soviet Politburo--General Secretary Leonid
Brezhnev, KGB head Yuri Andropov, and Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov--the
late 1960s and early '70s seemed a golden era. These men had survived the
nightmare of the Stalin years and the bumbling reign of Khrushchev. Now,
finally, there was some stability in the Soviet empire. Its satellite states in
Eastern Europe were relatively docile, particularly after an uprising in
Czechoslovakia in 1968 had been squashed. Its archnemesis, the United States,
had received a black eye from the Vietnam War. And, most promising of all, the
Russians had slowly been able to expand their influence in the Third World. The
future looked bright.
If one overshoots the goal, one cannot hit it. If a bird will not come to its nest
but flies higher and higher, it eventually falls into the hunter's net. He who in
times of extraordinary salience of small things does not know how to call a
halt, but restlessly seeks to press on and on, draws upon himself misfortune at
the hands of gods and men, because he deviates from the order of nature.
 
THE I CHING, CHINA, CIRCA EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.
A key country in the Russians' plans for expansion was Afghanistan, on their
southern border. Afghanistan was rich in natural gas and other minerals and had
ports on the Indian Ocean; to make it a Soviet satellite would be a dream come
true. The Russians had been insinuating themselves into the country since the
1950s, helping to train its army, building the Salang Highway from Kabul north
to the Soviet Union, and trying to modernize this backward nation. All was
going according to plan until the early to mid 1970s, when Islamic
fundamentalism began to become a political force across Afghanistan. The
Russians saw two dangers: first, that the fundamentalists would come to power
and, seeing communism as godless and loathsome, would cut off ties with the
Soviets; and second, that fundamentalist unrest would spill over from
Afghanistan into the southern Soviet Union, which had a large Islamic
population.
In 1978, to prevent such a nightmare scenario, Brezhnev secretly supported a
coup that brought the Afghan Communist Party to power. But the Afghan
Communists were hopelessly factionalized, and only after a long power struggle
did a leader emerge: Hafizullah Amin, whom the Soviets distrusted. On top of
that, the Communists were not popular in Afghanistan, and Amin resorted to the
most brutal means to maintain his party's power. This only fed the
fundamentalist cause. All around the country, insurgents--the mujahideen--began
to rebel, and thousands of Afghan soldiers defected from the army to them.
By December 1979 the Communist government in Afghanistan was on the
verge of collapse. In Russia the senior members of the Politburo met to discuss
the crisis. To lose Afghanistan would be a devastating blow and a source of
instability after so much progress had been made. They blamed Amin for their
problems; he had to go. Ustinov proposed a plan: Repeating what the Soviets
had done in quelling rebellions in Eastern Europe, he advocated a lightning
strike by a relatively small Soviet force that would secure Kabul and the Salang
Highway. Amin would then be ousted, and a Communist named Babrak Karmal
would take his place. The Soviet army would assume a low profile, and the
Afghan army would be beefed up to take over from it. During the course of some
ten years, Afghanistan would be modernized and would slowly become a stable
member of the Soviet Bloc. Blessed with peace and prosperity, the Afghan
people would see the great benefits of socialism and embrace it.
A few days after the meeting, Ustinov presented his plan to the army's chief
of staff, Nikolai Orgakov. Told that the invading army would not exceed 75,000
men, Orgakov was shocked: that force, he said, was far too small to secure the
large, mountainous expanses of Afghanistan, a very different world from Eastern
Europe. Ustinov countered that a giant invading force would generate bad
publicity for the Soviets in the Third World and would give the insurgents a rich
target. Orgakov responded that the fractious Afghans had a tradition of suddenly
uniting to throw out an invader--and that they were fierce fighters. Calling the
plan reckless, he said it would be better to attempt a political solution to the
problem. His warnings were ignored.
The plan was approved by the Politburo and on December 24 was put in
motion. Some Red Army forces flew into Kabul while others marched down the
Salang Highway. Amin was quietly taken away and killed while Karmal was
shuffled into power. Condemnation poured in from all over the world, but the
Soviets figured that would eventually die down--it usually did.
In February 1980, Andropov met with Karmal and instructed him on the
importance of winning the support of the Afghan masses. Presenting a plan for
that purpose, he also promised aid in money and expertise. He told Karmal that
once the borders were secured, the Afghan army built up, and the people
reasonably satisfied with the government, Karmal should politely ask the Soviets
to leave.
Solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant (They create desolation and call it
peace).
TACITUS, CIRCA A.D. 55-CIRCA 120
The invasion itself went more easily than the Soviets had expected, and for
this military phase their leaders could confidently declare "mission
accomplished." But within weeks of Andropov's visit, they had to adjust this
assessment: the mujahideen were not intimidated by the Soviet army, as the
Eastern Europeans had been. In fact, since the invasion their power only seemed
to grow, their ranks swelling with both Afghan recruits and outsiders. Ustinov
funneled more soldiers into Afghanistan and ordered a series of offensives in
parts of the country that were sheltering the mujahideen. The Soviets' first major
operation was that spring, when they moved into the Kunar Valley with heavy
weaponry, leveling entire villages and forcing the inhabitants to flee to refugee
camps in Pakistan. Having cleared the area of rebels, they withdrew.
A few weeks later, reports came in that the mujahideen had quietly returned
to the Kunar Valley. All the Soviets had done was leave the Afghans more
embittered and enraged, making it easier for the mujahideen to recruit. But what
could the Soviets do? To let the rebels alone was to give the mujahideen the time
and space to grow more dangerous, yet the army was too small to occupy whole
regions. Its answer was to repeat its police operations again and again, but with
more violence, hoping to intimidate the Afghans--but, as Orgakov had predicted,
this only emboldened them.

Ten thousand Muslims then marched through the mountain valleys upon
Mecca. Muhammad divided his force into four columns.... Muhammad gave
strict orders that no violence was to be used. His own tent was pitched on
high ground immediately overlooking the town. Eight years before, he had
fled from Mecca under cover of darkness, and lain hidden three days in a
cave on Mount Thor, which from his tent he could now see rising beyond the
city. Now ten thousand warriors were ready to obey his least command and
his native town lay helpless at his feet. After a brief rest, he remounted his
camel and entered the town, reverently touched the black stone and
performed the seven ritual circuits of the kaaba.... Muhammad the Conqueror
was not vindictive. A general amnesty was proclaimed, from which less than a
dozen persons were excluded, only four being actually executed. Ikrima, the
son of Abu Jahal, escaped to the Yemen, but his wife appealed to the Apostle,
who agreed to forgive him.... The Muslim occupation of Mecca was thus
virtually bloodless. The fiery Khalid ibn al Waleed killed a few people at the
southern gate and was sharply reprimanded by Muhammad for doing so.
Although the Apostle had himself been persecuted in the city and although
many of his bitterest opponents were still living there, he won all hearts by his
clemency on his day of triumph. Such generosity, or statesmanship, was
particularly remarkable among Arabs, a race to whom revenge has always
been dear. His success had been won by policy and diplomacy rather than by
military action. In an age of violence and bloodshed, he had realized that
ideas are more powerful than force.

Meanwhile Karmal initiated programs to teach literacy, to give more power
to women, to develop and modernize the country--all to peel off support from
the rebels. But the Afghans preferred their traditional way of life by a vast
majority, and the Communist Party's attempts to expand its influence had the
opposite effect.
Most ominous of all, Afghanistan quickly became a magnet for other
countries eager to exploit the situation there against the Soviets. The United
States in particular saw an opportunity to revenge itself on Russia for supplying
the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. The CIA funneled vast sums of
money and materiel to the mujahideen. In neighboring Pakistan, President Zia
ul-Haq viewed the invasion as a gift from heaven: having come to power a few
years earlier in a military coup, and having recently earned worldwide
condemnation by executing his prime minister, Zia saw a way to gain favor with
both the United States and the Arab nations by allowing Pakistan to serve as a
base for the mujahideen. The Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, who had recently
signed a controversial peace treaty with Israel, likewise saw a golden
opportunity to shore up his Islamic support by sending aid to fellow Muslims.
With Soviet armies stretched thin in Eastern Europe and around the world,
Ustinov refused to send in more men; instead he armed his soldiers with the
latest weaponry and worked to enlarge and strengthen the Afghan army. But
none of this translated into progress. The mujahideen improved their ambushes
of Soviet transports and used the latest Stinger missiles acquired from the
Americans to great effect. Years passed, and morale in the Soviet army dropped
precipitously: the soldiers felt the hatred of the local population and were stuck
guarding static positions, never knowing when the next ambush would come.
Abuse of drugs and alcohol became widespread.
As the costs of the war rose, the Russian public began to turn against it. But
the Soviet leaders could not afford to pull out: besides creating a dangerous
power vacuum in Afghanistan, that would deliver a sharp blow to their global
reputation as a superpower. And so they stayed, each year supposedly the last.
The senior members of the Politburo slowly died off--Brezhnev in 1982,
Andropov and Ustinov in 1984--without seeing the slightest progress.
In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet Union.
Having opposed the war from the beginning, Gorbachev started phased
withdrawals of troops from Afghanistan. The last soldiers left early in 1989. In
all, over 14,000 Soviet soldiers died in the conflict, but the hidden costs--to the
delicate Russian economy, to the people's slender faith in their government--
were far greater. Only a few years later, the entire system would come tumbling
down.
Interpretation
The great German general Erwin Rommel once made a distinction between a
gamble and a risk. Both cases involve an action with only a chance of success, a
chance that is heightened by acting with boldness. The difference is that with a
risk, if you lose, you can recover: your reputation will suffer no long-term
damage, your resources will not be depleted, and you can return to your original
position with acceptable losses. With a gamble, on the other hand, defeat can
lead to a slew of problems that are likely to spiral out of control. With a gamble
there tend to be too many variables to complicate the picture down the road if
things go wrong. The problem goes further: if you encounter difficulties in a
gamble, it becomes harder to pull out--you realize that the stakes are too high;
you cannot afford to lose. So you try harder to rescue the situation, often making
it worse and sinking deeper into a hole that you cannot get out of. People are
drawn into gambles by their emotions: they see only the glittering prospects if
they win and ignore the ominous consequences if they lose. Taking risks is
essential; gambling is foolhardy. It can be years before you recover from a
gamble, if you recover at all.
The invasion of Afghanistan was a classic gamble. The Soviets were drawn
in by the irresistible lure of possessing a client state in the region. Dazzled by
that prospect, they ignored the reality: the mujahideen and outside powers had
too much at stake to ever allow the Soviets to leave behind a secure Afghanistan.
There were too many variables beyond their control: the actions of the United
States and Pakistan, the mountainous border areas impossible to seal off, and
more. An occupying army in Afghanistan involved a double bind: the larger the
military presence, the more it would be hated, and the more it was hated, the
larger it would have to be to protect itself, and so on indefinitely.
Yet the Soviets took their gamble and made their mess. Now, too late, they
realized that the stakes had been raised: to pull out--to lose--would be a
devastating blow to their prestige. It would mean the expansion of American
interests and a cancerous insurgency on their border. Since they should never
have invaded in the first place, they had no rational exit strategy. The best they
could do would be to cut their losses and run--but that is nearly impossible with
a gamble, for gambling is governed by emotions, and once the emotions are
engaged, it is difficult to retreat.
The worst way to end anything--a war, a conflict, a relationship--is slowly
and painfully. The costs of such an ending run deep: loss of self-confidence,
unconscious avoidance of conflict the next time around, the bitterness and
animosity left breeding--it is all an absurd waste of time. Before entering any
action, you must calculate in precise terms your exit strategy. How exactly will
the engagement end, and where it will leave you? If the answers to those
questions seem vague and full of speculation, if success seems all too alluring
and failure somewhat dangerous, you are more than likely taking a gamble. Your
emotions are leading you into a situation that could end up a quagmire.
Before that happens, catch yourself. And if you do find you have made this
mistake, you have only two rational solutions: either end the conflict as quickly
as you can, with a strong, violent blow aimed to win, accepting the costs and
knowing they are better than a slow and painful death, or cut your losses and quit
without delay. Never let pride or concern for your reputation pull you farther into
the morass; both will suffer far greater blows by your persistence. Short-term
defeat is better than long-term disaster. Wisdom is knowing when to end.

end).

To go too far is as bad as to fall short.
--Confucius (551?-479 B.C.)
ENDING AS BEGINNING
As a young man, Lyndon B. Johnson had just one dream: to climb the ladder of
politics and become president. When Johnson was in his mid-twenties, the goal
was starting to seem unreachable. A job as the secretary of a Texas congressman
had allowed him to meet and make an impression on President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who had named him the Texas director of the National Youth
Administration, a post promising excellent political connections. But Texas
voters were extremely loyal, often returning congressmen to their seats for
decades, or until they died. Johnson urgently wanted a seat in Congress. If he did
not get one soon enough, he would be too old to climb the ladder, and he burned
with ambition.
On February 22, 1937, out of the blue, the chance of a lifetime opened up:
the Texas congressman James Buchanan suddenly died. The seat he left empty,
that of Texas's Tenth District, was a rare opportunity, and the state's eligible
political heavyweights immediately threw their hats in the ring. The many
contenders included Sam Stone, a popular county judge; Shelton Polk, an
ambitious young Austin attorney; and C. N. Avery, Buchanan's former campaign
manager, the favorite to win. Avery had the support of Tom Miller, mayor of
Austin, the Tenth District's only large city. With Miller's backing he could count
on almost enough votes to win the election.
Johnson was faced with a terrible predicament. If he entered the race, the
odds would be absurdly against him: he was young--only twenty-eight--and in
the district he was unknown and poorly connected. A bad loss would damage his
reputation and set him far back on the road to his long-term goal. If he chose not
to run, on the other hand, he might wait ten years for another chance. With all
this in mind, he threw caution to the winds and entered the race.
Indeed, deepening study of past experience leads to the conclusion that
nations might often have come nearer to their object by taking advantage of a
lull in the struggle to discuss a settlement than by pursuing the war with the
aim of "victory." History reveals, also, that in many cases a beneficial peace
could have been obtained if the statesmen of the warring nations had shown
more understanding of the elements of psychology in their peace "feelers."
Their attitude has commonly been too akin to that seen in the typical domestic
quarrel; each party is afraid to appear yielding, with the result that when one
of them shows any inclination towards conciliation this is usually expressed
in language that is too stiff, while the other is apt to be slow to respond--
partly from pride or obstinacy and partly from a tendency to interpret such a
gesture as a sign of weakening when it may be a sign of returning common
sense. Thus the fateful moment passes, and conflict continues--to the common
damage. Rarely does a continuation serve any good purpose where the two
parties are bound to go on living under the same roof. This applies even more
to modern war than to domestic conflict, since the industrialization of nations
has made their fortunes inseparable.
STRATEGY, B. H. LIDDELL HART, 1954
Johnson's first step was to call to his side the dozens of young men and
women whom he had helped or hired over the years. His campaign strategy was
simple: he would separate himself from the other contenders by presenting
himself as Roosevelt's staunchest supporter. A vote for Johnson was a vote for
the president, the popular architect of the New Deal. And since Johnson could
not compete in Austin, he decided to aim his army of volunteers at the
countryside, the sparsely populated Hill Country. This was the district's poorest
area, a place where candidates rarely ventured. Johnson wanted to meet every
last farmer and sharecropper, shake every possible hand, win the votes of people
who had never voted before. It was the strategy of a desperate man who
recognized that this was his best and only chance for victory.
One of Johnson's most loyal fol
