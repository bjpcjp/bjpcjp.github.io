TAKE THE LINE OF LEAST EXPECTATION
THE ORDINARY-EXTRAORDINARY STRATEGY
People expect your behavior to conform to known patterns and conventions.
Your task as a strategist is to upset their expectations. Surprise them and chaos
and unpredictability--which they try desperately to keep at bay--enter their
world, and in the ensuing mental disturbance, their defenses are down and they
are vulnerable. First, do something ordinary and conventional to fix their image
of you, then hit them with the extraordinary. The terror is greater for being so
sudden. Never rely on an unorthodox strategy that worked before--it is
conventional the second time around. Sometimes the ordinary is extraordinary
because it is unexpected.
UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE
Thousands of years ago, military leaders--aware of the incredibly high stakes
involved in war--would search high and low for anything that could bring their
army an advantage on the battlefield. Some generals who were particularly
clever would devise novel troop formations or an innovative use of infantry or
cavalry: the newness of the tactic would prevent the enemy from anticipating it.
Being unexpected, it would create confusion in the enemy. An army that gained
the advantage of surprise in this way could often leverage it into victory on the
battlefield and perhaps a string of victories.
The enemy, however, would work hard to come up with a defense against
the new strategy, whatever it was, and would often find one quite fast. So what
once brought brilliant success and was the epitome of innovation soon no longer
worked and in fact became conventional. Furthermore, in the process of working
out a defense against a novel strategy, the enemy itself would often be forced to
innovate; now it was their turn to introduce something surprising and horribly
effective. And so the cycle would go on. War has always been ruthless; nothing
stays unconventional for long. It is either innovate or die.
In the eighteenth century, nothing was more startling than the tactics of the
Prussian king Frederick the Great. To top Frederick's success, French military
theorists devised radical new ideas that were finally tested on the battlefield by
Napoleon. In 1806, Napoleon crushed the Prussians--who were still using the
once unconventional tactics of Frederick the Great, now grown stale--at the
Battle of Jena-Auerstadt. The Prussians were humiliated by their defeat; now it
was up to them to innovate. They studied in depth Napoleon's success, adapted
his best strategies, and took them further, creating the seeds for the formation of
the German General Staff. This new Prussian army played a large role in the
defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo and went on to dominate the military scene for
decades.
In modern times the constant challenge to top the enemy with something
new and unconventional has taken a turn into dirty warfare. Loosening the codes
of honor and morality that in the past limited what a general could do (at least to
some extent), modern armies have slowly embraced the idea that anything goes.
Guerrilla and terrorist tactics have been known since ancient times; now they
have become not only more common but more strategic and refined.
Propaganda, disinformation, psychological warfare, deception, and political
means of waging war have all become active ingredients in any unconventional
strategy. A counterstrategy usually develops to deal with the latest in dirty
warfare, but it often involves falling to the enemy's level, fighting fire with fire.
The dirty enemy adapts by sinking to a dirtier level still, creating a downward
spiral.
This dynamic is particularly intense in warfare but it permeates every aspect
of human activity. If you are in politics and business and your opponents or
competitors come up with a novel strategy, you must adapt it for your own
purposes or, better, top it. Their once new tactic becomes conventional and
ultimately useless. Our world is so fiercely competitive that one side will almost
always end up resorting to something dirty, something outside earlier codes of
accepted behavior. Ignore this spiral out of a sense of morality or pride and you
put yourself at a severe disadvantage; you are called to respond--in all likelihood
to fight a little dirty yourself.
Everything which the enemy least expects will succeed the best. If he relies
for security on a chain of mountains that he believes impracticable, and you
pass these mountains by roads unknown to him, he is confused to start with,
and if you press him he will not have time to recover from his consternation.
In the same way, if he places himself behind a river to defend the crossing
and you find some ford above or below on which to cross unknown to him,
this surprise will derange and confuse him....
FREDERICK THE GREAT, 1712-86
The spiral dominates not just politics or business but culture as well, with its
desperate search for the shocking and novel to gain attention and win momentary
acclaim. Anything goes. The speed of the process has grown exponentially with
time; what was unconventional in the arts a few years ago now seems
unbearably trite and the height of conformity.
What we consider unconventional has changed over the years, but the laws
that make unconventionality effective, being based on elemental psychology, are
timeless. And these immutable laws are revealed in the history of warfare.
Almost twenty-five hundred years ago, the great Chinese strategist Sun-tzu
expressed their essence in his discussion of ordinary and extraordinary means;
his analysis is as relevant to modern politics and culture as it is to warfare,
whether clean or dirty. And once you understand the essence of unconventional
warfare, you will be able to use it in your daily life.
Unconventional warfare has four main principles, as gleaned from the great
practitioners of the art.
 
Work outside the enemy's experience. Principles of war are based on
precedent: a kind of canon of strategies and counterstrategies develops over the
centuries, and since war is so dangerously chaotic, strategists come to rely on
these principles for lack of anything else. They filter what's happening now
through what happened in the past. The armies that have shaken the world,
though, have always found a way to operate outside the canon, and thus outside
the enemy's experience. This ability imposes chaos and disorder on the enemy,
which cannot orient itself to novelty and collapses in the process.
Your task as a strategist is to know your enemies well, then use your
knowledge to contrive a strategy that goes outside their experience. What they
might have read or heard about matters less than their personal experience,
which dominates their emotional lives and determines their responses. When the
Germans invaded France in 1940, the French had secondhand knowledge of their
blitzkrieg style of warfare from their invasion of Poland the year before but had
never experienced it personally and were overwhelmed. Once a strategy is used
and is no longer outside your enemy's experience, though, it will not have the
same effect if repeated.
 
Unfold the extraordinary out of the ordinary. To Sun-tzu and the ancient
Chinese, doing something extraordinary had little effect without a setup of
something ordinary. You had to mix the two--to fix your opponents' expectations
with some banal, ordinary maneuver, a comfortable pattern that they would then
expect you to follow. With the enemy sufficiently mesmerized, you would then
hit it with the extraordinary, a show of stunning force from an entirely new
angle. Framed by the predictable, the blow would have double the impact.
Make a false move, not to pass it for a genuine one but to transform it into a
genuine one after the enemy has been convinced of its falsity.
THE WILES OF WAR: 36 MILITARY STRATEGIES FROM ANCIENT
CHINA, TRANSLATED BY SUN HAICHEN, 1991
The unconventional maneuver that confused enemies, though, would have
become conventional the second or third time around. So the wily general might
then go back to the ordinary strategy that he had used earlier to fix their attention
and use it for his main attack, for that would be the last thing the enemy would
expect. And so the ordinary and the extraordinary are effective only if they play
off each other in a constant spiraling manner. This applies to culture as much as
to war: to gain attention with some cultural product, you have to create
something new, but something with no reference to ordinary life is not in fact
unconventional, but merely strange. What is truly shocking and extraordinary
unfolds out of the ordinary. The intertwining of the ordinary and extraordinary is
the very definition of surrealism.
 
Act crazy like a fox. Despite appearances, a lot of disorder and irrationality
lurks beneath the surface of society and individuals. That is why we so
desperately strain to maintain order and why people acting irrationally can be
terrifying: they are demonstrating that they have lost the walls we build to keep
out the irrational. We cannot predict what they will do next, and we tend to give
them a wide berth--it is not worth mixing it up with such sources of chaos. On
the other hand, these people can also inspire a kind of awe and respect, for
secretly we all desire access to the irrational seas churning inside us. In ancient
times the insane were seen as divinely possessed; a residue of that attitude
survives. The greatest generals have all had a touch of divine, strategic madness.
The secret is to keep this streak under control. Upon occasion you allow
yourself to operate in a way that is deliberately irrational, but less is more--do
this too much and you may be locked up. You will in any case frighten people
more by showing an occasional flash of insanity, just enough to keep everyone
off balance and wondering what will come next. As an alternative, act somewhat
randomly, as if what you did were determined by a roll of the dice. Randomness
is thoroughly disturbing to humans. Think of this behavior as a kind of therapy--
a chance to indulge occasionally in the irrational, as a relief from the oppressive
need to always seem normal.
 
Keep the wheels in constant motion. The unconventional is generally the
province of the young, who are not comfortable with conventions and take great
pleasure in flouting them. The danger is that as we age, we need more comfort
and predictability and lose our taste for the unorthodox. This is how Napoleon
declined as a strategist: he came to rely more on the size of his army and on its
superiority in weapons than on novel strategies and fluid maneuvers. He lost his
taste for the spirit of strategy and succumbed to the growing weight of his
accumulating years. You must fight the psychological aging process even more
than the physical one, for a mind full of stratagems, tricks, and fluid maneuvers
will keep you young. Make a point of breaking the habits you have developed, of
acting in a way that is contrary to how you have operated in the past; practice a
kind of unconventional warfare on your own mind. Keep the wheels turning and
churning the soil so that nothing settles and clumps into the conventional.
No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by something unexpected.
--Julius Caesar (100-44 B.C.)
HISTORICAL EXAMPLES
1. In 219 B.C., Rome decided it had had enough of the Carthaginians, who had
been stirring up trouble in Spain, where both city-states had valuable colonies.
The Romans declared war on Carthage and prepared to send an army to Spain,
where the enemy forces were led by the twenty-eight-year-old general Hannibal.
Before the Romans could reach Hannibal, though, they received the startling
news that he was coming to them--he had already marched east, crossing the
most treacherous part of the Alps into northern Italy. Because Rome had never
imagined that an enemy would attack from that direction, there were no
garrisons in the area, and Hannibal's march south toward Rome was unimpeded.
His army was relatively small; only some 26,000 soldiers had survived the
crossing of the Alps. The Romans and their allies could field an army of close to
750,000 men; their legions were the most disciplined and feared fighters in the
world, and they had already defeated Carthage in the First Punic War, twenty-
odd years earlier. But an alien army marching into Italy was a novel surprise, and
it stirred the rawest emotions. They had to teach these barbarians a lesson for
their brazen invasion.
Legions were quickly dispatched to the north to destroy Hannibal. After a
few skirmishes, an army under the Roman consul Sempronius Longus prepared
to meet the Carthaginians in direct battle near the river Trebia. Sempronius
burned with both hatred and ambition: he wanted to crush Hannibal and also to
be seen as the savior of Rome. But Hannibal was acting strangely. His light
cavalry would cross the river as if to attack the Romans, then retreat back: Were
the Carthaginians afraid? Were they ready to make only minor raids and sorties?
Finally Sempronius had had enough and went in pursuit. To make sure he had
sufficient forces to defeat the enemy, he brought his entire army across the
freezing-cold river (it was wintertime), all of which took hours and was
exhausting. Finally, however, the two armies met just to the west of the river.
It is assumed that Alexander encamped at Haranpur; opposite him on the
eastern back of the Hydaspes was Porus, who was seen to have with him a
large number of elephants....... Because all fords were held by pickets and
elephants, Alexander realized that his horses could neither be swum nor
rafted across the river, because they would not face the trumpeting of the
elephants and would become frantic when in the water or on their rafts. He
resorted to a series of feints. While small parties were dispatched to
reconnoitre all possible crossing places, he divided his army into columns,
which he marched up and down the river as if he sought a place of crossing.
Then, when shortly before the summer solstice the rains set in and the river
became swollen, he had corn conveyed from all quarters to his camp so that
Porus might believe that he had resolved to remain where he was until the dry
weather. In the meantime he reconnoitred the river with his ships and ordered
tent skins to be stuffed with hay and converted into rafts. Yet, as Arrian
writes, "all the time he was waiting in ambush to see whether by rapidity of
movement he could not steal a passage anywhere without being observed." At
length, and we may be certain after a close personal reconnaissance,
Alexander resolved to make the attempt at the headland and island described
by Arrian, and in preparation he decided on a manoeuvre almost identical
with that adopted by General Wolfe in his 1759 Quebec campaign. Under
cover of night he sent out his cavalry to various points along the western
bank of the river with orders to make a clamour, and from time to time to
raise the battle-cry; for several nights Porus marched his elephants up and
down the eastern bank to block an attempted crossing until he got tired of it,
kept his elephants in camp, and posted scouts along the eastern bank. Then
"when Alexander had brought it about that the mind of Porus no longer
entertained any fear of his nocturnal attempts, he devised the following
stratagem": Upstream and along the western bank he posted a chain of
sentries, each post in sight and hearing of the next one, with orders to raise a
din and keep their picket fires burning, while visible preparations were made
at the camp to effect a crossing....... When Porus had been lulled into a sense
of false security and all preparations were completed at the camp and the
crossing place, Alexander set out secretly and kept at some distance from the
western bank of the river so that his march would not be observed....
THE GENERALSHIP OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT, J. F. C. FULLER,
1960
At first, as Sempronius had expected, his tough, disciplined legions fared
well against the Carthaginians. But on one side the Roman lines were made up
of Gallic tribesmen fighting for the Romans, and here, suddenly, the
Carthaginians unleashed a group of elephants ridden by archers. The tribesmen
had never seen such beasts; they panicked and fell into a chaotic retreat. At the
same time, as if out of nowhere, some 2,000 Carthaginians, hidden in dense
vegetation near the river, fell on the Romans' rear. The Romans fought bravely to
get out of the trap that Hannibal had laid for them, but thousands of them
drowned in the frigid waters of the Trebia.
The battle was a disaster, and back in Rome emotions turned from outrage to
anxiety. Legions were quickly dispatched to block the most accessible passes in
the Apennines, the mountains that run across central Italy, but once again
Hannibal defied expectations: he crossed the Apennines at their most unlikely,
most inhospitable point, one that no army had ever passed through before
because of the treacherous marshes on the other side. But after four days of
trudging through soft mud, Hannibal brought the Carthaginians to safe ground.
Then, in yet another clever ambush, he defeated a Roman army at Lake
Trasimene, in present-day Umbria. Now his path to Rome was clear. In a state of
near panic, the Roman republic resorted to the ancient tradition of appointing a
dictator to lead them through the crisis. Their new leader, Fabius Maximus,
quickly built up the city's walls and enlarged the Roman army, then watched
perplexed as Hannibal bypassed Rome and headed south into Apulia, the most
fertile part of Italy, and began to devastate the countryside.
Determined first and foremost to protect Rome, Fabius came up with a novel
strategy: he would post his legions in mountainous areas where Hannibal's
cavalry would be harmless, and he would harass the Carthaginians in a guerrilla-
style campaign, denying them supplies and isolating them in their position so far
from home. Avoiding direct battle with their formidable leader at all costs, he
would defeat them by exhausting them. But many Romans saw Fabius's strategy
as disgraceful and unmanly. Worse, as Hannibal continued to raid the
countryside, he hit none of Fabius's many properties, making it seem as if the
two were in cahoots. Fabius became more and more unpopular.
Having razed Apulia, Hannibal entered a fertile plain in Campania, to
Rome's south--terrain that Fabius knew well. Finally deciding he had to act or be
thrown out of power, the dictator devised a trap: he stationed Roman armies at
all the exit points from the plain, each army close enough to support the other.
But Hannibal had entered Campania through the eastern mountain pass of
Allifae, and Fabius had noticed that he never left by the same route he entered.
Although Fabius kept a sufficiently large Roman garrison at Allifae just in case,
he reinforced the other passes in greater numbers. The beast, he thought, was
caged. Eventually Hannibal's supplies would run out, and he would be forced to
try to break through. Fabius would wait.
In the weeks to come, Hannibal sent his cavalry north, perhaps trying to
break out in that direction. He also plundered the richest farms in the area.
Fabius saw through his tricks: he was trying to bait the Romans into a battle of
his choice. But Fabius was determined to fight on his own terms, and only when
the enemy tried to retreat from the trap. Anyway, he knew Hannibal would try to
break through to the east, the only direction that afforded him a clean break, into
country the Romans did not control.
One night the Roman soldiers guarding the pass at Allifae saw sights and
heard sounds that made them think they were losing their minds: an enormous
army, signaled by thousands of torches, seemed to be heading up the pass,
covering its slopes, accompanied by loud bellowing sounds as if possessed by
some evil demon. The army seemed irresistible--far larger than the maximum
estimate of Hannibal's strength.
