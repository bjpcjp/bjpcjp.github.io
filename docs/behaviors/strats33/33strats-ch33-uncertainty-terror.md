SOW UNCERTAINTY AND PANIC THROUGH
ACTS OF TERROR
THE CHAIN-REACTION STRATEGY
Terror is the ultimate way to paralyze a people's will to resist and destroy their
ability to plan a strategic response. Such power is gained through sporadic acts
of violence that create a constant feeling of threat, incubating a fear that spreads
throughout the public sphere. The goal in a terror campaign is not battlefield
victory but causing maximum chaos and provoking the other side into desperate
overreaction. Melting invisibly into the population, tailoring their actions for the
mass media, the strategists of terror create the illusion that they are everywhere
and therefore that they are far more powerful than they really are. It is a war of
nerves. The victims of terror must not succumb to fear or even anger; to plot the
most effective counterstrategy, they must stay balanced. In the face of a terror
campaign, one's rationality is the last line of defense.
THE ANATOMY OF PANIC
In Isfahan (in present-day Iran) toward the end of the eleventh century, Nizam
al-Mulk, the powerful vizier to Sultan Malik Shah, ruler of the great Islamic
empire of the period, became aware of a small yet irritating threat. In northern
Persia lived a sect called the Nizari Ismailis, followers of a religion combining
mysticism with the Koran. Their leader, the charismatic Hasan-i-Sabah, had
recruited thousands of converts alienated by the tight control the empire
exercised over religious and political practices. The influence of the Ismailis was
growing, and what was most disturbing to Nizam al-Mulk was the utter secrecy
in which they operated: it was impossible to know who had converted to the
sect, for its members did so in private and kept their allegiance hidden.
"Brothers," says an Ismaili poet, "when the time of triumph comes, with good
fortune from both worlds as our companion, then by one single warrior on
foot a king may be stricken with terror, though he own more than a hundred
thousand horsemen."
QUOTED IN THE ASSASSINS, BERNARD LEWIS, 1967
The vizier monitored their activities as best he could, until finally he heard
some news that roused him to action. Over the years, it seemed, thousands of
these secret Ismaili converts had managed to infiltrate key castles, and now they
had taken them over in the name of Hasan-i-Sabah. This gave them control over
part of northern Persia, a kind of independent state within the empire. Nizam al-
Mulk was a benevolent administrator, but he knew the danger of allowing sects
like the Ismailis to flourish. Better to snuff them out early on than face
revolution. So, in 1092, the vizier convinced the sultan to send two armies to
bring down the castles and destroy the Nizari Ismailis.
The castles were strongly defended, and the countryside around them teemed
with sympathizers. The war turned into a stalemate, and eventually the sultan's
armies were forced to come home. Nizam al-Mulk would have to find some
other solution, perhaps an occupying force for the region--but a few months
later, as he was traveling from Isfahan to Baghdad, a Sufi monk approached the
litter on which he was carried, pulled out a dagger from under his clothes, and
stabbed the vizier to death. The killer was revealed to be an Ismaili dressed as a
peaceful Sufi, and he confessed to his captors that Hasan himself had assigned
him to do the job.
The death of Nizam al-Mulk was followed within weeks by the death, from
natural causes, of Malik Shah. His loss would have been a blow at any time, but
without his crafty vizier to oversee the succession, the empire fell into a period
of chaos that lasted several years. By 1105, however, a degree of stability had
been reestablished and attention again focused on the Ismailis. With one murder
they had managed to make the entire empire tremble. They had to be destroyed.
A new and vigorous campaign was launched against the sect. And soon it was
revealed that the assassination of Nizam al-Mulk was not a single act of revenge,
as it had seemed at the time, but an Ismaili policy, a strange and frightening new
way of waging war. Over the next few years, key members of the administration
of the new sultan, Muhammad Tapar, were assassinated in the same ritualistic
fashion: a killer would emerge from a crowd to deliver a deadly blow with a
dagger. The deed was most often done in public and in broad daylight;
sometimes, though, it took place while the victim was in bed, a secret Ismaili
having infiltrated his household staff.
A wave of fear fanned out among the empire's hierarchy. It was impossible
to tell who was an Ismaili: the sect's adherents were patient, disciplined, and had
mastered the art of keeping their beliefs to themselves and fitting in anywhere. It
did not help that when the assassins were captured and tortured, they would
accuse various people within the sultan's inner circle of being either paid spies
for the Ismailis or secret converts. No one could know for certain if they were
telling the truth, but suspicion was cast on everyone.
Losses to which we are accustomed affect us less deeply.
 
JUVENAL, FIRST TO SECOND CENTURY A.D.
Now viziers, judges, and local officials had to travel surrounded by
bodyguards. Many of them began to wear thick, uncomfortable shirts of mail. In
certain cities no one could move from house to house without a permit, which
spread disaffection among the citizenry and made it easier for the Ismailis to
recruit converts. Many found it hard to sleep at night or to trust their closest
friends. All kinds of wild rumors were spread by those who had grown delirious
with paranoia. Bitter divisions sprang up within the hierarchy, as some argued
for a hard-line approach to Hasan, while others preached accommodation as the
only answer.
Meanwhile, as the empire struggled to somehow repress the Ismailis, the
killings went on--but they were highly sporadic. Months would pass without
one, and then suddenly there would be two within a week. There was no real
rhyme or reason to when it happened or which high administrator was singled
out. Officials would talk endlessly about a pattern, analyzing every Ismaili
move. Without their realizing it, this little sect had come to dominate their
thoughts.
In 1120, Sanjar, the new sultan, decided to take action, planning a military
campaign to capture the Ismaili castles with overwhelming force and turn the
region around them into an armed camp. He took extra precautions to prevent
any attempt on his life, changing his sleeping arrangements and allowing only
those he knew well to approach him. By making himself personally secure, he
believed he could stay free of the panic around him.
As preparations for the war got under way, Hasan-i-Sabah sent ambassador
after ambassador to Sanjar offering to negotiate an end to the killings. They were
all turned away. The tables seemed to have turned: now it was the Ismailis who
were frightened.
Shortly before the campaign was to be launched, the sultan awoke one
morning to find a dagger thrust neatly in the ground a few feet away from the
position where his breast lay on the bed. How did it get there? What did it mean?
The more he thought about it, the more he began to literally tremble with fear--it
was clearly a message. He told no one about this, for whom could he trust? Even
his wives were suspect. By the end of the day, he was an emotional wreck. That
evening he received a message from Hasan himself: "Did I not wish the sultan
well, that dagger which was struck into the hard ground would have been planted
in his soft breast."
On their voyage Pisander and the others abolished the democracies in the
[Greek] cities, as had been decided. From some places they also took hoplites
to add to their forces, and so came to Athens. Here they found that most of the
work had already been done by members of their [antidemocratic] party.
Some of the younger men had formed a group among themselves and had
murdered without being detected a certain Androcles, who was one of the
chief leaders of the [democratic] party.... There were also some other people
whom they regarded as undesirable and did away with secretly.......
[Athenians] were afraid when they saw their numbers, and no one now dared
to speak in opposition to them. If anyone did venture to do so, some
appropriate method was soon found for having him killed, and no one tried to
investigate such crimes or take action against those suspected of them.
Instead the people kept quiet, and were in such a state of terror that they
thought themselves lucky enough to be left unmolested even if they had said
nothing at all. They imagined that the revolutionary party was much bigger
than it really was, and they lost all confidence in themselves, being unable to
find out the facts because of the size of the city and because they had
insufficient knowledge of each other.... Throughout the democratic party
people approached each other suspiciously, everyone thinking that the next
man had something to do with what was going on.

CIRCA 399 B.C.
Sanjar had had enough. He could not spend another day like this. He was not
willing to live in constant fear, his mind deranged by uncertainty and suspicion.
It was better, he thought, to negotiate with this demon. He called off his
campaign and made peace with Hasan.
Over the years, as the Ismailis' political power grew and the sect expanded
into Syria, its killers became almost mythic. The assassins had never tried to
escape; their killing done, they were caught, tortured, and executed to a man, but
new ones kept on coming, and nothing seemed to deter them from completing
their task. They seemed possessed, utterly devoted to their cause. Some called
them hashshashin, from the Arabic word hashish, because they acted as if they
were drugged. European crusaders to the Holy Land heard stories about these
devilish hashshashin and passed them on, the word slowly transforming into
"assassins," passing forever into the language.
Interpretation
Hasan-i-Sabah had one goal: to carve out a state for his sect in northern Persia,
allowing it to survive and thrive within the Islamic empire. Given his relatively
small numbers and the powers arrayed against him, he could not hope for more,
so he devised a strategy that was surely history's first organized terrorist
campaign for political power. Hasan's plan was deceptively simple. In the
Islamic world, a leader who had won respect was invested with considerable
authority, and to the extent that he had authority, his death could sow chaos.
Accordingly Hasan chose to strike these leaders, but in a somewhat random way:
it was impossible to see any pattern in his choices, and the possibility of being
the next victim was more disturbing than many could bear. In truth, except for
the castles they held, the Ismailis were quite weak and vulnerable, but by
patiently infiltrating his men deep into the heart of the sultan's administration,
Hasan was able to create the illusion they were everywhere. Only fifty or so
assassinations are recorded in his entire lifetime, and yet he won as much
political power through them as if he had an enormous army.
This power could not come by merely making individuals feel afraid. It
depended on the effect the killings would have on the entire social group. The
weakest officials in the hierarchy were the ones who would succumb to paranoia
and voice doubts and rumors that would spread and infect those who were less
weak. The result was a ripple effect--wild swings of emotion, from anger to
surrender, up and down the line. A group caught by this kind of panic cannot
find its balance and can fall with the slightest push. Even the strongest and most
determined will be infected in the end, as Sultan Sanjar was: his attempts at
security, and the harsh life to which he subjected himself as protection, revealed
that he was under the influence of this panic. One simple dagger in the ground
was enough to push him over the edge.
Understand: we are all are extremely susceptible to the emotions of those
around us. It is often hard for us to perceive how deeply we are affected by the
moods that can pass through a group. This is what makes the use of terror so
effective and so dangerous: with a few well-timed acts of violence, a handful of
assassins can spark all kinds of corrosive thoughts and uncertainties. The
weakest members of the target group will succumb to the greatest fear, spreading
rumors and anxieties that slowly overcome the rest. The strong may respond
angrily and violently to the terror campaign, but that only shows how influenced
they are by the panic; they are reacting rather than strategizing--a sign of
weakness, not strength. In normal circumstances individuals who become
frightened in some way can often regain their mental balance over time,
especially when they are around others who are calm. But this is almost
impossible within a panicked group.
As the public's imagination runs wild, the assassins become something much
larger, seeming omnipotent and omnipresent. As Hasan proved, a handful of
terrorists can hold an entire empire hostage with a few well-calibrated blows
against the group psyche. And once the group's leaders succumb to the
emotional pull--whether by surrendering or launching an unstrategic
counterattack--the success of the terror campaign is complete.
Victory is gained not by the number killed but by the number frightened.
--Arab proverb
KEYS TO WARFARE
In the course of our daily lives, we are subject to fears of many kinds. These
fears are generally related to something specific: someone might harm us, a
particular problem is brewing, we are threatened by disease or even death itself.
In the throes of any deep fear, our willpower is momentarily paralyzed as we
contemplate the bad that could happen to us. If this condition lasted too long or
were too intense, it would make life unbearable, so we find ways to avoid these
thoughts and ease our fears. Maybe we turn to the distractions of daily life:
work, social routines, activities with friends. Religion or some other belief
system, such as faith in technology or science, might also offer hope. These
distractions and beliefs become the ground beneath us, keeping us upright and
able to walk on without the paralysis that fear can bring.
Under certain circumstances, however, this ground can fall away from under
us, and then there is nothing we can do to steady ourselves. In the course of
history, we can track a kind of madness that overcomes humans during certain
disasters--a great earthquake, a ferocious plague, a violent civil war. What
troubles us most in these situations is not any specific dreadful event that
happened in the recent past; we have a tremendous capacity to overcome and
adapt to anything horrible. It is the uncertain future, the fear that more terrible
things are coming and that we might soon suffer some unpredictable tragedy--
that is what unnerves us. We cannot crowd out these thoughts with routines or
religion. Fear becomes chronic and intense, our minds besieged by all kinds of
irrational thoughts. The specific fears become more general. Among a group,
panic will set in.
Six at the top means: Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around. Going
ahead brings misfortune. If it has not yet touched one's own body But has
reached one's neighbor first, There is no blame. One's comrades have
something to talk about. When inner shock is at its height, it robs a man of
reflection and clarity of vision. In such a state of shock it is of course
impossible to act with presence of mind. Then the right thing is to keep still
until composure and clarity are restored. But this a man can do only when he
himself is not yet infected by the agitation, although its disastrous effects are
already visible in those around him. If he withdraws from the affair in time,
he remains free of mistakes and injury. But his comrades, who no longer heed
any warning, will in their excitement certainly be displeased with him.
However, he must not take this into account.
 
THE I CHING, CHINA, CIRCA EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.
In essence, this is terror: an intense, overpowering fear that we cannot
manage or get rid of in the normal way. There is too much uncertainty, too many
bad things that can happen to us.
During World War II, when the Germans bombed London, psychologists
noted that when the bombing was frequent and somewhat regular, the people of
the city became numb to it; they grew accustomed to the noise, discomfort, and
carnage. But when the bombing was irregular and sporadic, fear became terror. It
was much harder to deal with the uncertainty of when the next one would land.
It is a law of war and strategy that in the search for an advantage, anything
will be tried and tested. And so it is that groups and individuals, seeing the
immense power that terror can have over humans, have found a way to use terror
as a strategy. People are crafty, resourceful, and adaptable creatures. The way to
paralyze their will and destroy their capacity to think straight is to consciously
create uncertainty, confusion, and an unmanageable fear.
Such strategic terror can take the form of exemplary acts of destruction. The
masters of this art were the Mongols. They would level a few cities here and
there, in as horrible a manner as possible. The terrifying legend of the Mongol
Horde spread quickly. At its very approach to a city, panic would ensue as the
inhabitants could only imagine the worst. More often than not, the city would
surrender without a fight--the Mongols' goal all along. A relatively small army
far from home, they could not afford long sieges or protracted wars.
This strategic terror can also be used for political purposes, to hold a group
or nation together. In 1792 the French Revolution was spinning out of control.
Foreign armies were on the verge of invading France; the country was
hopelessly factionalized. The radicals, led by Robespierre, confronted this threat
by initiating a war against the moderates, the Reign of Terror. Accused of
counterrevolution, thousands were sent to the guillotine. No one knew who
would be next. Although the radicals were relatively small in number, by
creating such uncertainty and fear they were able to paralyze their opponents'
will. Paradoxically, the Reign of Terror--which gives us the first recorded
instance of the use of the words "terrorism" and "terrorist"--produced a degree of
stability.
Although terror as a strategy can be employed by large armies and indeed
whole states, it is most effectively practiced by those small in number. The
reason is simple: the use of terror usually requires a willingness to kill innocent
civilians in the name of a greater good and for a strategic purpose. For centuries,
with a few notable exceptions such as the Mongols, military leaders were
unwilling to go so far. Meanwhile a state that inflicted mass terror on its own
populace would unleash demons and create a chaos it might find hard to control.
But small groups have no such problems. Being so few in number, they cannot
hope to wage a conventional war or even a guerrilla campaign. Terror is their
strategy of last resort. Taking on a much larger enemy, they are often desperate,
and they have a cause to which they are utterly committed. Ethical
considerations pale in comparison. And creating chaos is part of their strategy.
Terrorism was limited for many centuries by its tools: the sword, the knife,
the gun, all agents of individual killing. Then, in the nineteenth century, a single
campaign produced a radical innovation, giving birth to terrorism as we know it
today.
In the late 1870s, a group of Russian radicals, mostly from the intelligentsia,
had been agitating for a peasant-led revolution. Eventually they realized that
their cause was hopeless: the peasants were unprepared to take this kind of
action, and, more important, the czarist regime and its repressive for
