CONTENTS
PREFACE
PART I SELF-DIRECTED WARFARE
1
DECLARE WAR ON YOUR ENEMIES: THE POLARITY STRATEGY
Life is endless battle and conflict, and you cannot fight effectively unless you
can identify your enemies. Learn to smoke out your enemies, to spot them by
the signs and patterns that reveal hostility. Then, once you have them in your
sights, inwardly declare war. Your enemies can fill you with purpose and
direction.
2
DO NOT FIGHT THE LAST WAR: THE GUERRILLA-WAR-OF-THE-
MIND STRATEGY
What most often weighs you down and brings you misery is the past. You must
consciously wage war against the past and force yourself to react to the
present moment. Be ruthless on yourself; do not repeat the same tired
methods. Wage guerrilla war on your mind, allowing no static lines of defense-
-make everything fluid and mobile.
3
AMIDST THE TURMOIL OF EVENTS, DO NOT LOSE YOUR
PRESENCE OF MIND: THE COUNTERBALANCE STRATEGY
In the heat of battle, the mind tends to lose its balance. It is vital to keep your
presence of mind, maintaining your mental powers, whatever the
circumstances. Make the mind tougher by exposing it to adversity. Learn to
detach yourself from the chaos of the battlefield.
4
CREATE A SENSE OF URGENCY AND DESPERATION: THE DEATH-
GROUND STRATEGY
You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the
future instead of engaging in the present. Cut your ties to the past; enter
unknown territory. Place yourself on "death ground," where your back is
against the wall and you have to fight like hell to get out alive.
PART II ORGANIZATIONAL (TEAM) WARFARE
5
AVOID THE SNARES OF GROUPTHINK: THE COMMAND-AND-
CONTROL STRATEGY
The problem in leading any group is that people inevitably have their own
agendas. You have to create a chain of command in which they do not feel
constrained by your influence yet follow your lead. Create a sense of
participation, but do not fall into groupthink--the irrationality of collective
decision making.
6
SEGMENT YOUR FORCES: THE CONTROLLED-CHAOS STRATEGY
The critical elements in war are speed and adaptability--the ability to move and
make decisions faster than the enemy. Break your forces into independent
groups that can operate on their own. Make your forces elusive and
unstoppable by infusing them with the spirit of the campaign, giving them a
mission to accomplish, and then letting them run.
7
TRANSFORM YOUR WAR INTO A CRUSADE: MORALE
STRATEGIES
The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to
think less about themselves and more about the group. Involve them in a
cause, a crusade against a hated enemy. Make them see their survival as tied
to the success of the army as a whole.
PART III DEFENSIVE WARFARE
8
PICK YOUR BATTLES CAREFULLY: THE PERFECT-ECONOMY
STRATEGY
We all have limitations--our energies and skills will take us only so far. You
must know your limits and pick your battles carefully. Consider the hidden
costs of a war: time lost, political goodwill squandered, an embittered enemy
bent on revenge. Sometimes it is better to wait, to undermine your enemies
covertly rather than hitting them straight on.
9
TURN THE TABLES: THE COUNTERATTACK STRATEGY
Moving first--initiating the attack--will often put you at a disadvantage: You
are exposing your strategy and limiting your options. Instead, discover the
power of holding back and letting the other side move first, giving you the
flexibility to counterattack from any angle. If your opponents are aggressive,
bait them into a rash attack that will leave them in a weak position.
10
CREATE A THREATENING PRESENCE: DETERRENCE STRATEGIES
The best way to fight off aggressors is to keep them from attacking you in the
first place. Build up a reputation: You're a little crazy. Fighting you is not
worth it. Uncertainty is sometimes better than overt threat: If your opponents
are never sure what messing with you will cost, they will not want to find out.
11
TRADE SPACE FOR TIME: THE NONENGAGEMENT STRATEGY
Retreat in the face of a strong enemy is a sign not of weakness but of strength.
By resisting the temptation to respond to an aggressor, you buy yourself
valuable time--time to recover, to think, to gain perspective. Sometimes you
can accomplish most by doing nothing.
PART IV OFFENSIVE WARFARE
12
LOSE BATTLES BUT WIN THE WAR: GRAND STRATEGY
Grand strategy is the art of looking beyond the battle and calculating ahead. It
requires that you focus on your ultimate goal and plot to reach it. Let others
get caught up in the twists and turns of the battle, relishing their little victories.
Grand strategy will bring you the ultimate reward: the last laugh.
13
KNOW YOUR ENEMY: THE INTELLIGENCE STRATEGY
The target of your strategies should be less the army you face than the mind of
the man or woman who runs it. If you understand how that mind works, you
have the key to deceiving and controlling it. Train yourself to read people,
picking up the signals they unconsciously send about their innermost thoughts
and intentions.
14
OVERWHELM RESISTANCE WITH SPEED AND SUDDENNESS: THE
BLITZKRIEG STRATEGY
In a world in which many people are indecisive and overly cautious, the use of
speed will bring you untold power. Striking first, before your opponents have
time to think or prepare, will make them emotional, unbalanced, and prone to
error.
15
CONTROL THE DYNAMIC: FORCING STRATEGIES
People are constantly struggling to control you. The only way to get the upper
hand is to make your play for control more intelligent and insidious. Instead of
trying to dominate the other side's every move, work to define the nature of the
relationship itself. Maneuver to control your opponents' minds, pushing their
emotional buttons and compelling them to make mistakes.
16
HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS: THE CENTER-OF-GRAVITY
STRATEGY
Everyone has a source of power on which he or she depends. When you look
at your rivals, search below the surface for that source, the center of gravity
that holds the entire structure together. Hitting them there will inflict
disproportionate pain. Find what the other side most cherishes and protects--
that is where you must strike.
17
DEFEAT THEM IN DETAIL: THE DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER
STRATEGY
Never be intimidated by your enemy's appearance. Instead, look at the parts
that make up the whole. By separating the parts, sowing dissension and
division, you can bring down even the most formidable foe. When you are
facing troubles or enemies, turn a large problem into small, eminently
defeatable parts.
18
EXPOSE AND ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT'S SOFT FLANK: THE
TURNING STRATEGY
When you attack people directly, you stiffen their resistance and make your
task that much harder. There is a better way: Distract your opponents'
attention to the front, then attack them from the side, where they least expect
it. Bait people into going out on a limb, exposing their weakness, then rake
them with fire from the side.
19
ENVELOP THE ENEMY: THE ANNIHILATION STRATEGY
People will use any kind of gap in your defenses to attack you. So offer no
gaps. The secret is to envelop your opponents--create relentless pressure on
them from all sides and close off their access to the outside world. As you
sense their weakening resolve, crush their willpower by tightening the noose.
20
MANEUVER THEM INTO WEAKNESS: THE RIPENING-FOR-THE-
SICKLE STRATEGY
No matter how strong you are, fighting endless battles with people is
exhausting, costly, and unimaginative. Wise strategists prefer the art of
maneuver: Before the battle even begins, they find ways to put their opponents
in positions of such weakness that victory is easy and quick. Create dilemmas:
Devise maneuvers that give them a choice of ways to respond-all of them bad.
21
NEGOTIATE WHILE ADVANCING: THE DIPLOMATIC-WAR
STRATEGY
Before and during negotiations, you must keep advancing, creating relentless
pressure and compelling the other side to settle on your terms. The more you
take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. Create a
reputation for being tough and uncompromising, so that people are back on
their heels before they even meet you.
22
KNOW HOW TO END THINGS: THE EXIT STRATEGY
You are judged in this world by how well you bring things to an end. A messy
or incomplete conclusion can reverberate for years to come. The art of ending
things well is knowing when to stop. The height of strategic wisdom is to avoid
all conflicts and entanglements from which there are no realistic exits.
PART V
UNCONVENTIONAL (DIRTY) WARFARE
23
WEAVE A SEAMLESS BLEND OF FACT AND FICTION:
MISPERCEPTION STRATEGIES
Since no creature can survive without the ability to see or sense what is going
on around it, make it hard for your enemies to know what is going on around
them, including what you are doing. Feed their expectations, manufacture a
reality to match their desires, and they will fool themselves. Control people's
perceptions of reality and you control them.
24
TAKE THE LINE OF LEAST EXPECTATION: THE ORDINARY-
EXTRAORDINARY STRATEGY
People expect your behavior to conform to known patterns and conventions.
Your task as a strategist is to upset their expectations. First do something
ordinary and conventional to fix their image of you, then hit them with the
extraordinary. The terror is greater for being so sudden. Sometimes the
ordinary is extraordinary because it is unexpected.
25
OCCUPY THE MORAL HIGH GROUND: THE RIGHTEOUS
STRATEGY
In a political world, the cause you are fighting for must seem more just than
the enemy's. By questioning your opponents' motives and making them appear
evil, you can narrow their base of support and room to maneuver. When you
yourself come under moral attack from a clever enemy, do not whine or get
angry; fight fire with fire.
26
DENY THEM TARGETS: THE STRATEGY OF THE VOID
The feeling of emptiness or void--silence, isolation, nonengagement with
others--is for most people intolerable. Give your enemies no target to attack, be
dangerous but elusive, then watch as they chase you into the void. Instead of
frontal battles, deliver irritating but damaging side attacks and pinprick bites.
27
SEEM TO WORK FOR THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS WHILE
FURTHERING YOUR OWN: THE ALLIANCE STRATEGY
The best way to advance your cause with the minimum of effort and bloodshed
is to create a constantly shifting network of alliances, getting others to
compensate for your deficiencies, do your dirty work, fight your wars. At the
same time, you must work to sow dissension in the alliances of others,
weakening your enemies by isolating them.
28
GIVE YOUR RIVALS ENOUGH ROPE TO HANG THEMSELVES: THE
ONE-UPMANSHIP STRATEGY
Life's greatest dangers often come not from external enemies but from our
supposed colleagues and friends who pretend to work for the common cause
while scheming to sabotage us. Work to instill doubts and insecurities in such
rivals, getting them to think too much and act defensively. Make them hang
themselves through their own self-destructive tendencies, leaving you
blameless and clean.
29
TAKE SMALL BITES: THE FAIT ACCOMPLI STRATEGY
Overt power grabs and sharp rises to the top are dangerous, creating envy,
distrust, and suspicion. Often the best solution is to take small bites, swallow
little territories, playing upon people's relatively short attention spans. Before
people realize it, you have accumulated an empire.
30
PENETRATE THEIR MINDS: COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES
Communication is a kind of war, its field of battle the resistant and defensive
minds of the people you want to influence. The goal is to penetrate their
defenses and occupy their minds. Learn to infiltrate your ideas behind enemy
lines, sending messages through little details, luring people into coming to the
conclusions you desire and into thinking they've gotten there by themselves.
31
DESTROY FROM WITHIN: THE INNER-FRONT STRATEGY
By infiltrating your opponents' ranks, working from within to bring them
down, you give them nothing to see or react against--the ultimate advantage.
To take something you want, do not fight those who have it, but rather join
them--then either slowly make it your own or wait for the moment to stage a
coup d'etat.
32
DOMINATE WHILE SEEMING TO SUBMIT: THE PASSIVE-
AGGRESSION STRATEGY
In a world where political considerations are paramount, the most effective
form of aggression is the best hidden one: aggression behind a compliant,
even loving exterior. To follow the passive-aggression strategy you must seem
to go along with people, offering no resistance. But actually you dominate the
situation. Just make sure you have disguised your aggression enough that you
can deny it exists.
33
SOW UNCERTAINTY AND PANIC THROUGH ACTS OF TERROR:
THE CHAIN-REACTION STRATEGY
Terror is the ultimate way to paralyze a people's will to resist and destroy their
ability to plan a strategic response. The goal in a terror campaign is not
battlefield victory but causing maximum chaos and provoking the other side
into desperate overreaction. To plot the most effective counterstrategy, victims
of terror must stay balanced. One's rationality is the last line of defense.

INDEX
PREFACE
We live in a culture that promotes democratic values of being fair to one and all,
the importance of fitting into a group, and knowing how to cooperate with other
people. We are taught early on in life that those who are outwardly combative
and aggressive pay a social price: unpopularity and isolation. These values of
harmony and cooperation are perpetuated in subtle and not-so-subtle ways--
through books on how to be successful in life; through the pleasant, peaceful
exteriors that those who have gotten ahead in the world present to the public;
through notions of correctness that saturate the public space. The problem for us
is that we are trained and prepared for peace, and we are not at all prepared for
what confronts us in the real world--war.
The life of man upon earth is a warfare.
JOB 7:1
Qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum (let him who wants peace prepare for
war)
VEGETIUS, A.D. FOURTH CENTURY
This war exists on several levels. Most obviously, we have our rivals on the
other side. The world has become increasingly competitive and nasty. In politics,
business, even the arts, we face opponents who will do almost anything to gain
an edge. More troubling and complex, however, are the battles we face with
those who are supposedly on our side. There are those who outwardly play the
team game, who act very friendly and agreeable, but who sabotage us behind the
scenes, use the group to promote their own agenda. Others, more difficult to
spot, play subtle games of passive aggression, offering help that never comes,
instilling guilt as a secret weapon. On the surface everything seems peaceful
enough, but just below it, it is every man and woman for him-or herself, this
dynamic infecting even families and relationships. The culture may deny this
reality and promote a gentler picture, but we know it and feel it, in our battle
scars.
It is not that we and our colleagues are ignoble creatures who fail to live up
to ideals of peace and selflessness, but that we cannot help the way we are. We
have aggressive impulses that are impossible to ignore or repress. In the past,
individuals could expect a group--the state, an extended family, a company--to
take care of them, but this is no longer the case, and in this uncaring world we
have to think first and foremost of ourselves and our interests. What we need are
not impossible and inhuman ideals of peace and cooperation to live up to, and
the confusion that brings us, but rather practical knowledge on how to deal with
conflict and the daily battles we face. And this knowledge is not about how to be
more forceful in getting what we want or defending ourselves but rather how to
be more rational and strategic when it comes to conflict, channeling our
aggressive impulses instead of denying or repressing them. If there is an ideal to
aim for, it should be that of the strategic warrior, the man or woman who
manages difficult situations and people through deft and intelligent maneuver.
[Strategy] is more than a science: it is the application of knowledge to
practical life, the development of thought capable of modifying the original
guiding idea in the light of ever-changing situations; it is the art of acting
under the pressure of the most difficult conditions.
HELMUTH VON MOLTKE, 1800-1891
Many psychologists and sociologists have argued that it is through conflict
that problems are often solved and real differences reconciled. Our successes and
failures in life can be traced to how well or how badly we deal with the
inevitable conflicts that confront us in society. The common ways that people
deal with them--trying to avoid all conflict, getting emotional and lashing out,
turning sly and manipulative--are all counterproductive in the long run, because
they are not under conscious and rational control and often make the situation
worse. Strategic warriors operate much differently. They think ahead toward
their long-term goals, decide which fights to avoid and which are inevitable,
know how to control and channel their emotions. When forced to fight, they do
so with indirection and subtle maneuver, making their manipulations hard to
trace. In this way they can maintain the peaceful exterior so cherished in these
political times.
This ideal of fighting rationally comes to us from organized warfare, where
the art of strategy was invented and refined. In the beginning, war was not at all
strategic. Battles between tribes were fought in a brutal manner, a kind of ritual
of violence in which individuals could display their heroism. But as tribes
expanded and evolved into states, it became all too apparent that war had too
many hidden costs, that waging it blindly o
