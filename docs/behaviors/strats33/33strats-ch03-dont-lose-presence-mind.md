AMIDST THE TURMOIL OF EVENTS, DO NOT
LOSE YOUR PRESENCE OF MIND
THE COUNTERBALANCE STRATEGY
In the heat of battle, the mind tends to lose its balance. Too many things confront
you at the same time--unexpected setbacks, doubts and criticisms from your own
allies. There's a danger of responding emotionally, with fear, depression, or
frustration. It is vital to keep your presence of mind, maintaining your mental
powers whatever the circumstances. You must actively resist the emotional pull
of the moment--staying decisive, confident, and aggressive no matter what hits
you. Make the mind tougher by exposing it to adversity. Learn to detach yourself
from the chaos of the battlefield. Let others lose their heads; your presence of
mind will steer you clear of their influence and keep you on course.
[Presence of mind] must play a great role in war, the domain of the
unexpected, since it is nothing but an increased capacity of dealing with the
unexpected. We admire presence of mind in an apt repartee, as we admire
quick thinking in the face of danger.... The expression "presence of mind"
precisely conveys the speed and immediacy of the help provided by the
intellect.
ON WAR, CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
THE HYPERAGGRESSIVE TACTIC
Vice Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson (1758-1805) had been through it all. He had
lost his right eye in the siege of Calvi and his right arm in the Battle of Tenerife.
He had defeated the Spanish at Cape St. Vincent in 1797 and had thwarted
Napoleon's Egyptian campaign by defeating his navy at the Battle of the Nile the
following year. But none of his tribulations and triumphs prepared him for the
problems he faced from his own colleagues in the British navy as they prepared
to go to war against Denmark in February 1801.
Nelson, England's most glorious war hero, was the obvious choice to lead
the fleet. Instead the Admiralty chose Sir Hyde Parker, with Nelson his second-
in-command. This war was a delicate business; it was intended to force the
disobedient Danes to comply with a British-led embargo on the shipping of
military goods to France. The fiery Nelson was prone to lose his cool. He hated
Napoleon, and if he went too far against the Danes, he would produce a
diplomatic fiasco. Sir Hyde was an older, more stable, even-tempered man who
would do the job and nothing more.
Nelson swallowed his pride and took the assignment, but he saw trouble
ahead. He knew that time was of the essence: the faster the navy sailed, the less
chance the Danes would have to build up their defenses. The ships were ready to
sail, but Parker's motto was "Everything in good order." It wasn't his style to
hurry. Nelson hated his casualness and burned for action: he reviewed
intelligence reports, studied maps, and came up with a detailed plan for fighting
the Danes. He wrote to Parker urging him to seize the initiative. Parker ignored
him.
More life may trickle out of men through thought than through a gaping
wound.
THOMAS HARDY, 1840-1928
At last, on March 11, the British fleet set sail. Instead of heading for
Copenhagen, however, Parker anchored well to the north of the city's harbor and
called a meeting of his captains. According to intelligence reports, he explained,
the Danes had prepared elaborate defenses for Copenhagen. Boats anchored in
the harbor, forts to the north and south, and mobile artillery batteries could blast
the British out of the water. How to fight this artillery without terrible losses?
Also, pilots who knew the waters around Copenhagen reported that they were
treacherous, places of sandbars and tricky winds. Navigating these dangers under
bombardment would be harrowing. With all of these difficulties, perhaps it was
best to wait for the Danes to leave harbor and then fight them in open sea.
Nelson struggled to control himself. Finally he let loose, pacing the room,
the stub of his lost arm jerking as he spoke. No war, he said, had ever been won
by waiting. The Danish defenses looked formidable "to those who are children at
war," but he had worked out a strategy weeks earlier: he would attack from the
south, the easier approach, while Parker and a reserve force would stay to the
city's north. Nelson would use his mobility to take out the Danish guns. He had
studied the maps: sandbars were no threat. As for the wind, aggressive action
was more important than fretting over wind.
Nelson's speech energized Parker's captains. He was by far their most
successful leader, and his confidence was catching. Even Sir Hyde was
impressed, and the plan was approved.
So Grant was alone; his most trusted subordinates besought him to change
his plans, while his superiors were astounded at his temerity and strove to
interfere. Soldiers of reputation and civilians in high places condemned, in
advance, a campaign that seemed to them as hopeless as it was
unprecedented. If he failed, the country would concur with the Government
and the Generals. Grant knew all this, and appreciated his danger, but was as
invulnerable to the apprehensions of ambition as to the entreaties of
friendship, or the anxieties even of patriotism. That quiet confidence in
himself which never forsook him, and which amounted indeed almost to a
feeling of fate, was uninterrupted. Having once determined in a matter that
required irreversible decision, he never reversed, nor even misgave, but was
steadily loyal to himself and his plans. This absolute and implicit faith was,
however, as far as possible from conceit or enthusiasm; it was simply a
consciousness or conviction, rather, which brought the very strength it
believed in; which was itself strength, and which inspired others with a trust
in him, because he was able thus to trust himself.
MILITARY HISTORY OF ULYSSES S. GRANT, ADAM BADEAU, 1868
The next morning Nelson's line of ships advanced on Copenhagen, and the
battle began. The Danish guns, firing on the British at close range, took a fierce
toll. Nelson paced the deck of his flagship, HMS Elephant, urging his men on.
He was in an excited, almost ecstatic state. A shot through the mainmast nearly
hit him: "It is warm work, and this day may be the last to any of us at any
moment," he told a colonel, a little shaken up by the blast, "but mark you, I
would not be elsewhere for thousands."
Parker followed the battle from his position to the north. He now regretted
agreeing to Nelson's plan; he was responsible for the campaign, and a defeat here
could ruin his career. After four hours of back-and-forth bombardment, he had
seen enough: the fleet had taken a beating and had gained no advantage. Nelson
never knew when to quit. Parker decided it was time to hoist signal flag 39, the
order to withdraw. The first ships to see it were to acknowledge it and pass the
signal on down the line. Once acknowledged there was nothing else to do but
retreat. The battle was over.
On board the Elephant, a lieutenant told Nelson about the signal. The vice-
admiral ignored it. Continuing to pound the Danish defenses, he eventually
called to an officer, "Is number sixteen still hoisted?" Number 16 was his own
flag; it meant "Engage the enemy more closely." The officer confirmed that the
flag was still flying. "Mind you keep it so," Nelson told him. A few minutes
later, Parker's signal still flapping in the breeze, Nelson turned to his flag
captain: "You know, Foley, I have only one eye--I have a right to be blind
sometimes." And raising his telescope to his blind eye, he calmly remarked, "I
really do not see the signal."
Torn between obeying Parker and obeying Nelson, the fleet captains chose
Nelson. They would risk their careers along with his. But soon the Danish
defenses started to crack; some of the ships anchored in the harbor surrendered,
and the firing of the guns began to slow. Less than an hour after Parker's signal
to stop the battle, the Danes surrendered.
The next day Parker perfunctorily congratulated Nelson on the victory. He
did not mention his subordinate's disobedience. He was hoping the whole affair,
including his own lack of courage, would be quietly forgotten.
Interpretation
When the Admiralty put its faith in Sir Hyde, it made a classical military error: it
entrusted the waging of a war to a man who was careful and methodical. Such
men may seem calm, even strong, in times of peace, but their self-control often
hides weakness: the reason they think things through so carefully is that they are
terrified of making a mistake and of what that might mean for them and their
career. This doesn't come out until they are tested in battle: suddenly they cannot
make a decision. They see problems everywhere and defeat in the smallest
setback. They hang back not out of patience but out of fear. Often these moments
of hesitation spell their doom.
There was once a man who may be called the "generalissimo" of robbers and
who went by the name of Hakamadare. He had a strong mind and a powerful
build. He was swift of foot, quick with his hands, wise in thinking and
plotting. Altogether there was no one who could compare with him. His
business was to rob people of their possessions when they were off guard.
Once, around the tenth month of a year, he needed clothing and decided to
get hold of some. He went to prospective spots and walked about, looking.
About midnight when people had gone to sleep and were quiet, under a
somewhat blurry moon he saw a man dressed in abundant clothes sauntering
about on a boulevard. The man, with his trouser-skirt tucked up with strings
perhaps and in a formal hunting robe which gently covered his body, was
playing the flute, alone, apparently in no hurry to go to any particular place.
Wow, here's a fellow who's shown up just to give me his clothes, Hakamadare
thought. Normally he would have gleefully run up and beaten his quarry
down and robbed him of his clothes. But this time, unaccountably, he felt
something fearsome about the man, so he followed him for a couple of
hundred yards. The man himself didn't seem to think, Somebody's following
me. On the contrary, he continued to play the flute with what appeared to be
greater calm. Give him a try, Hakamadare said to himself, and ran up close
to the man, making as much clatter as he could with his feet. The man,
however, looked not the least disturbed. He simply turned to look, still playing
the flute. It wasn't possible to jump on him. Hakamadare ran off.
Hakamadare tried similar approaches a number of times, but the man
remained utterly unperturbed. Hakamadare realized he was dealing with an
unusual fellow. When they had covered about a thousand yards, though,
Hakamadare decided he couldn't continue like this, drew his sword, and ran
up to him. This time the man stopped playing the flute and, turning, said,
"What in the world are you doing?" Hakamadare couldn't have been struck
with greater fear even if a demon or a god had run up to attack him when he
was walking alone. For some unaccountable reason he lost both heart and
courage. Overcome with deathly fear and despite himself, he fell on his knees
and hands. "What are you doing?" the man repeated. Hakamadare felt he
couldn't escape even if he tried. "I'm trying to rob you," he blurted out. "My
name is Hakamadare." "I've heard there's a man about with that name, yes. A
dangerous, unusual fellow, I'm told," the man said. Then he simply said to
Hakamadare, "Come with me," and continued on his way, playing the flute
again. Terrified that he was dealing with no ordinary human being, and as if
possessed by a demon or a god, Hakamadare followed the man, completely
mystified. Eventually the man walked into a gate behind which was a large
house. He stepped inside from the verandah after removing his shoes. While
Hakamadare was thinking, He must be the master of the house, the man came
back and summoned him. As he gave him a robe made of thick cotton cloth,
he said, "If you need something like this in the future, just come and tell me. If
you jump on somebody who doesn't know your intentions, you may get hurt."
Afterward it occurred to Hakamadare that the house belonged to Governor of
Settsu Fujiwara no Yasumasa. Later, when he was arrested, he is known to
have observed, "He was such an unusually weird, terrifying man!" Yasumasa
was not a warrior by family tradition because he was a son of Munetada. Yet
he was not the least inferior to anyone who was a warrior by family tradition.
He had a strong mind, was quick with his hands, and had tremendous
strength. He was also subtle in thinking and plotting. So even the imperial
court did not feel insecure in employing him in the way of the warrior. As a
result, the whole world greatly feared him and was intimidated by him.
LEGENDS OF THE SAMURAI, HIROAKI SATO, 1995
Lord Nelson operated according to the opposite principle. Slight of build,
with a delicate constitution, he compensated for his physical weakness with
fierce determination. He forced himself to be more resolute than anyone around
him. The moment he entered battle, he ratcheted up his aggressive impulses.
Where other sea lords worried about casualties, the wind, changes in the enemy's
formation, he concentrated on his plan. Before battle no one strategized or
studied his opponent more thoroughly. (That knowledge helped Nelson to sense
when the enemy was ready to crumble.) But once the engagement began,
hesitation and carefulness were dropped.
Presence of mind is a kind of counterbalance to mental weakness, to our
tendency to get emotional and lose perspective in the heat of battle. Our greatest
weakness is losing heart, doubting ourselves, becoming unnecessarily cautious.
Being more careful is not what we need; that is just a screen for our fear of
conflict and of making a mistake. What we need is double the resolve--an
intensification of confidence. That will serve as a counterbalance.
In moments of turmoil and trouble, you must force yourself to be more
determined. Call up the aggressive energy you need to overcome caution and
inertia. Any mistakes you make, you can rectify with more energetic action still.
Save your carefulness for the hours of preparation, but once the fighting begins,
empty your mind of doubts. Ignore those who quail at any setback and call for
retreat. Find joy in attack mode. Momentum will carry you through.
The senses make a more vivid impression on the mind than systematic
thought.... Even the man who planned the operation and now sees it being
carried out may well lose confidence in his earlier judgment.... War has a
way of masking the stage with scenery crudely daubed with fearsome
apparitions. Once this is cleared away, and the horizon becomes
unobstructed, developments will confirm his earlier convictions--this is one of
the great chasms between planning and execution.
--Carl von Clausewitz, ON WAR (1780-1831)
THE DETACHED-BUDDHA TACTIC
Watching the movie director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) at work on a film set
was often quite a surprise to those seeing it for the first time. Most filmmakers
are wound-up balls of energy, yelling at the crew and barking out orders, but
Hitchcock would sit in his chair, sometimes dozing, or at least with his eyes half
closed. On the set of Strangers on a Train, made in 1951, the actor Farley
Granger thought Hitchcock's behavior meant he was angry or upset and asked
him if anything was wrong. "Oh," Hitchcock replied sleepily, "I'm so bored."
The crew's complaints, an actor's tantrums--nothing fazed him; he would just
yawn, shift in his chair, and ignore the problem. "Hitchcock...didn't seem to
direct us at all," said the actress Margaret Lockwood. "He was a dozing, nodding
Buddha with an enigmatic smile on his face."
It was hard for Hitchcock's colleagues to understand how a man doing such
stressful work could stay so calm and detached. Some thought it was part of his
character--that there was something inherently cold-blooded about him. Others
thought it a gimmick, a put-on. Few suspected the truth: before the filmmaking
had even begun, Hitchcock would have prepared for it with such intense
attention to detail that nothing could go wrong. He was completely in control; no
temperamental actress, no panicky art director, no meddling producer could
upset him or interfere with his plans. Feeling such absolute security in what he
had set up, he could afford to lie back and fall asleep.
Hitchcock's process began with a storyline, whether from a novel or an idea
of his own. As if he had a movie projector in his head, he would begin to
visualize the film. Next, he would start meeting with a writer, who would soon
realize that this job was unlike any other. Instead of taking some producer's half-
baked idea and turning it into a screenplay, the writer was simply there to put on
paper the dream trapped in Hitchcock's mind. He or she would add flesh and
bones to the characters and would of course write the dialog, but not much else.
When Hitchcock sat down with the writer Samuel Taylor for the first script
meeting on the movie Vertigo (1958), his descriptions of several scenes were so
vivid, so intense, that the experiences seemed almost to have been real, or maybe
something he had dreamed. This completeness of vision foreclosed creative
conflict. As Taylor soon realized, although he was writing the script, it would
remain a Hitchcock creation.
Once the screenplay was finished, Hitchcock would transform it into an
elaborate shooting script. Blocking, camera positions, lighting, and set
dimensions were spelled out in detailed notes. Most directors leave themselves
some latitude, shooting scenes from several angles, for example, to give the film
editor options to work with later on. Not Hitchcock: he essentially edited the
entire film in the shooting script. He knew exactly what he wanted and wrote it
down. If a producer or actor tried to add or change a scene, Hitchcock was
outwardly pleasant--he could afford to pretend to listen--but inside he was totally
unmoved.
Nothing was left to chance. For the building of the sets (quite elaborate in a
movie like Rear Window), Hitchcock would present the production designer with
precise blueprints, floor plans, incredibly detailed lists of props. He supervised
every aspect of set construction. He was particularly attentive to the clothes of
his leading actresses: according to Edith Head, costumer on many Hitchcock
movies, including Dial M for Murder in 1954, "There was a reason for every
color, every style, and he was absolutely certain about everything he settled on.
For one scene he saw [Grace Kelly] in pale green, for another in white chiffon,
for another in gold. He was really putting a dream together in the studio." When
the actress Kim Novak refused to wear a gray suit in Vertigo because she felt it
made her look washed out, Hitchcock told her he wanted her to look like a
woman of mystery who had just stepped out of the San Francisco fog. How
could she argue with that? She wore the suit.
Hitchcock's actors found working with him strange yet pleasant. Some of
Hollywood's best--Joseph Cotten, Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman--
said that he was the easiest director to work for: his nonchalance was catching,
and since his films were so carefully staged as not to depend on the actor's
performance in any particular scene, they could relax. Everything went like
clockwork. As James Stewart told the cast of The Man Who Knew Too Much
(1956), "We're in the hands of an expert here. You can lean on him. Just do
everything he tells you and the whole thing will be okay."
As Hitchcock sat calmly on the set, apparently half asleep, the cast and crew
could see only the small part each one played. They had no idea how everything
fit into his vision. When Taylor saw Vertigo for the first time, it was like seeing
another man's dream. The film neatly duplicated the vision Hitchcock had
expressed to him many months before.
Interpretation
The first film Hitchcock directed was The Pleasure Garden, a silent he made in
1925. The production went wrong in every conceivab
