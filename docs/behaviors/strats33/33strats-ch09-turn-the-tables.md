TURN THE TABLES
THE COUNTERATTACK STRATEGY
Moving first--initiating the attack--will often put you at a disadvantage: you are
exposing your strategy and limiting your options. Instead discover the power of
holding back and letting the other side move first, giving you the flexibility to
counterattack from any angle. If your opponents are aggressive, bait them into a
rash attack that will leave them in a weak position. Learn to use their
impatience, their eagerness to get at you, as a way to throw them off balance and
bring them down. In difficult moments do not despair or retreat: any situation
can be turned around. If you learn how to hold back, waiting for the right
moment to launch an unexpected counterattack, weakness can become strength.
The technique of "according with" the enemy's expectations and desires
requires first determining what they believe and want, then apparently
conforming to them until the situation can be exploited: Definition: When the
enemy wants to take something and you yield it, it is termed "according
with."...In general, when going contrary to something merely solidifies it, it is
better to accord with it in order to lead them to flaws. If the enemy wants to
advance, be completely flexible and display weakness in order to induce an
advance. If the enemy wants to withdraw, disperse and open an escape route
for their retreat. If the enemy is relying upon a strong front, establish your
own front lines far off, solidly assuming a defensive posture in order to
observe their arrogance. If the enemy relies upon their awesomeness, be
emptily respectful but substantially plan while awaiting their laxness. Draw
them forward and cover them, release and capture them. Exploit their
arrogance, capitalize on their laxity.
SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY MING DYNASTY TEXT, QUOTED IN THE
TAO OF SPYCRAFT, RALPH D. SAWYER
DISGUISED AGGRESSION
In September 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte faced the greatest crisis until that
moment in his career: Austria and Russia had joined in an alliance against him.
To the south, Austrian troops were attacking the French soldiers occupying
northern Italy; to the east, the Austrian general Karl Mack was leading a large
force into Bavaria. A sizable Russian army under General Mikhail Kutusov was
on its way to join Mack's army, and this allied force, once merged and expanded,
would head for France. East of Vienna, more Russian and Austrian troops were
waiting to be deployed wherever needed. Napoleon's armies were outnumbered
two to one.
Napoleon's plan was to try to defeat each of the alliance's armies one by one,
using his smaller but more mobile corps to fight them before they could join
forces. While committing enough troops to produce a stalemate in Italy, he
moved into Bavaria before Kutusov could reach it and forced Mack's
ignominious surrender at Ulm, with hardly a shot being fired (see chapter 6).
This bloodless victory was a masterpiece, but to exploit it to its fullest, Napoleon
needed to catch Kutusov before the Russian general could himself be reinforced
by more Russian or Austrian troops. To that end, Napoleon sent the bulk of his
army east, toward Vienna, hoping to trap the retreating Russian forces. But the
pursuit bogged down: the weather was bad, the French troops were tired, their
marshals made mistakes, and, most important, the wily Kutusov was cleverer in
retreat than in attack. Managing to elude the French, he reached the town of
Olmutz, northeast of Vienna, where the remaining Austro-Russian forces were
stationed.
Now the situation reversed: suddenly it was Napoleon who was in grave
danger. The strength of his corps was their mobility; relatively small, they were
vulnerable individually and worked best when operating close enough to one
another to come fast to one another's support. Now they were dispersed in a long
line from Munich to Vienna, which Napoleon had taken after his victory over
Mack at Ulm. The men were hungry, tired, and short of supplies. The Austrians
fighting the French in northern Italy had given up the battle there and were in
retreat--but that put them heading northeast, posing a threat to Napoleon's
southern flank. To the north, the Prussians, seeing that Napoleon was in trouble,
were considering joining the alliance. If that happened, they could wreak havoc
on Napoleon's extended lines of communication and supply--and the two armies
moving in from north and south could squeeze him to death.
Napoleon's options were abysmal. To continue the pursuit of Kutusov would
further extend his lines. Besides, the Russians and Austrians were now 90,000
strong and in an excellent position at Olmutz. To stay put, on the other hand, was
to risk being slowly swallowed by armies on all sides. Retreat seemed the only
solution, and it was what his generals advised, but with the weather deteriorating
(it was mid-November) and the enemy sure to harass him, that would be costly,
too. And retreat would mean that his victory at Ulm had been wasted--a
tremendous blow to the morale of his men. That would virtually invite the
Prussians to join the war, and his enemies the English, seeing him vulnerable,
might go so far as to invade France. Whatever path he chose seemed to lead to
disaster. For several days he went into deep thought, ignoring his advisers and
poring over maps.
A rapid, powerful transition to the attack--the glinting sword of vengeance--is
the most brilliant moment of the defense.
CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
Meanwhile, at Olmutz, the Austrian and Russian leaders--among them the
Austrian Emperor Francis I and the young czar Alexander I--watched Napoleon's
moves with intense curiosity and excitement. They had him where they wanted
him; surely they would be able to recoup the disaster at Ulm and then some.
On November 25, alliance scouts reported that Napoleon had moved a large
part of his army to Austerlitz, halfway between Vienna and Olmutz. There it
looked as if his forces were occupying the Pratzen Heights, a position that would
indicate preparation for battle. But Napoleon had only some 50,000 men with
him; he was outnumbered nearly two to one. How could he hope to face the
allies? Even so, on November 27, Francis I offered him an armistice. Napoleon
was formidable, and even at those odds, fighting him was a risk. In truth, Francis
was also trying to buy enough time to envelop the French army completely, but
none of the alliance generals thought Napoleon would fall for that trick.
To their surprise, however, Napoleon seemed eager to come to terms.
Suddenly the czar and his generals had a new thought: he was panicking,
grasping at straws. That suspicion seemed borne out almost immediately, when,
on November 29, Napoleon abandoned the Pratzen Heights almost as soon as he
had taken them, assuming a position to their west and repeatedly repositioning
his cavalry. He appeared utterly confused. The next day he asked for a meeting
with the czar himself. Instead the czar sent an emissary, who reported back that
Napoleon had been unable to disguise his fear and doubt. He had seemed on
edge, emotional, even distraught. The emissary's conditions for armistice had
been harsh, and although Napoleon had not agreed to them, he had listened
quietly, seeming chastened, even intimidated. This was music to the ears of the
young czar, who was burning for his first engagement with Napoleon. He was
tired of waiting.
By abandoning the Pratzen Heights, Napoleon seemed to have put himself in
a vulnerable position: his southern lines were weak, and his route of retreat,
southwest toward Vienna, was exposed. An allied army could take the Pratzen
Heights, pivot south to break through that weak point in his lines and cut off his
retreat, then move back north to surround his army and destroy him. Why wait?
A better chance would never come. Czar Alexander and his younger generals
prevailed over the hesitant Austrian emperor and launched the attack.
A sudden inspiration then came to William [at the Battle of Hastings, A.D.
1066] , suggested by the disaster which had befallen the English right in the
first conflict. He determined to try the expedient of a feigned flight, a
stratagem not unknown to Bretons and Normans of earlier ages. By his
orders a considerable portion of the assailants suddenly wheeled about and
retired in seeming disorder. The English thought, with more excuse on this
occasion than on the last, that the enemy was indeed routed, and for the
second time a great body of them broke the line and rushed after the
retreating squadrons. When they were well on their way down the slope,
William repeated his former procedure. The intact portion of his host fell
upon the flanks of the pursuers, while those who had simulated flight faced
about and attacked them in front. The result was again a foregone
conclusion: the disordered men of the fyrd were hewn to pieces, and few or
none of them escaped back to their comrades on the height.
HISTORY OF THE ART OF WAR IN THE MIDDLE AGES, SIR CHARLES
OMAN, 1898
It began early on the morning of December 2. While two smaller divisions
faced off against the French from the north, pinning them down, a stream of
Russian and Austrian soldiers moved toward the Pratzen Heights, took them,
then wheeled to the south, aiming at the French weak point. Although they met
resistance from the outnumbered enemy, they quickly broke through and were
soon able to take the key positions that would allow them to turn north and
surround Napoleon. But at 9:00 A.M., as the last alliance troops (some 60,000
men in all) made their way to the heights and headed south, word reached the
allied commanders that something unexpected was afoot: a large French force,
invisible to them beyond the Pratzen Heights, was suddenly heading due east,
straight for the town of Pratzen itself and the center of the allied lines.
Kutusov saw the danger: the allies had advanced so many men into the gap
in the French lines that they had left their own center exposed. He tried to turn
back the last troops heading south, but it was too late. By 11:00 A.M. the French
had retaken the heights. Worse, French troops had come up from the southwest
to reinforce the southern position and prevent the allies from surrounding the
French. Everything had turned around. Through the town of Pratzen, the French
were now pouring through the allied center and were swiftly moving to cut off
the retreat of the allied troops to their south.
Each part of the allied army--north, center, and south--was now effectively
isolated from the others. The Russians in the southernmost position tried to
retreat farther to the south, but thousands of them lost their lives in the frozen
lakes and marshes in their path. By 5:00 P.M. the rout was complete, and a truce
was called. The Austro-Russian army had suffered terrible casualties, far more
than the French. The defeat was so great that the alliance collapsed; the
campaign was over. Somehow Napoleon had snatched victory from defeat.
Austerlitz was the greatest triumph of his career.
 
Interpretation In the crisis leading up to the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon's
advisers and marshals had thought only of retreat. Sometimes it is better, they
believed, to accept a setback willingly and go on the defensive. On the other side
stood the czar and his allies, who had Napoleon weak. Whether they waited to
envelop him or attacked right away, they were on the offensive.
In the middle was Napoleon, who, as a strategist, stood far above both his
own advisers and marshals, on the one hand, and the czar and alliance generals
on the other. His superiority lay in the fluidity of his thinking: he did not
conceive war in mutually exclusive terms of defense and offense. In his mind
they were inextricably linked: a defensive position was the perfect way to
disguise an offensive maneuver, a counterattack; an offensive maneuver was
often the best way to defend a weak position. What Napoleon orchestrated at
Austerlitz was neither retreat nor attack but something far more subtle and
creative: he fused defense and offense to set up the perfect trap.
When the enemy finds itself in a predicament and wants to engage us in a
decisive battle, wait; when it is advantageous for the enemy but not for us to
fight, wait; when it is expedient to remain still and whoever moves first will
fall into danger, wait; when two enemies are engaged in a fight that will
result in defeat or injury, wait; when the enemy forces, though numerous,
suffer from mistrust and tend to plot against one another, wait; when the
enemy commander, though wise, is handicapped by some of his cohorts, wait.
THE WILES OF WAR: 36 MILITARY STRATEGIES FROM ANCIENT
CHINA, TRANSLATED BY SUN HAICHEN, 1991
First, having taken Vienna, Napoleon advanced to Austerlitz, apparently
taking the offensive. That startled the Austrians and Russians, even though they
still heavily outnumbered him. Next he backed off and took a defensive position;
then he seemed to switch between offense and defense, giving every appearance
of confusion. In his meeting with the czar's emissary, he seemed confused
personally as well as strategically. It was all high drama, staged by Napoleon to
make him look weak and vulnerable, inviting attack.
These maneuvers fooled the allies into giving up prudence, striking out at
Napoleon with total abandon and exposing themselves in the process. Their
defensive position at Olmutz was so strong and dominant that only leaving it
would ruin it, and that was precisely what Napoleon lured them into doing.
Then, instead of defending himself against their rash attack, he suddenly
switched to the offensive himself, the counterattack. In doing so he altered the
dynamic of the battle not only physically but psychologically: when an attacking
army suddenly has to go on the defensive, its spirit crumbles. And indeed the
alliance troops panicked, retreating to the frozen lakes that Napoleon had
intended as their graveyard all along.
Most of us only know how to play either offensively or defensively. Either
we go into attack mode, charging our targets in a desperate push to get what we
want, or we try frantically to avoid conflict and, if it is forced on us, to ward off
our enemies as best we can. Neither approach works when it excludes the other.
Making offense our rule, we create enemies and risk acting rashly and losing
control of our own behavior, but constant defensiveness backs us into a corner,
becomes a bad habit. In either case we are predictable.
Instead consider a third option, the Napoleonic way. At times you seem
vulnerable and defensive, getting your opponents to disregard you as a threat, to
lower their guard. When the moment is right and you sense an opening, you
switch to the attack. Make your aggression controlled and your weakness a ploy
to disguise your intentions. In a dangerous moment, when those around you see
only doom and the need to retreat, that is when you smell an opportunity. By
playing weak you can seduce your aggressive enemies to come at you full
throttle. Then catch them off guard by switching to the offense when they least
expect it. Mixing offense and defense in this fluid fashion, you will stay one step
ahead of your inflexible opponents. The best blows are the ones they never see
coming.
These two main principles of application are specifically related to the
tactical value assigned to the personality of the opponent in combat.
According to the unilateral principle of application, the personality of the
opponent was considered the primary target of an attack or counterattack, for
the purpose of either total or partial subjugation. According to the bilateral
principle of application, on the other hand, the opponent's personality was
viewed not merely as a target, but also (and by certain bujutsu masters,
primarily) as an instrument--that is, as the unwilling but nevertheless useful
vector of his own subjugation....... It is the principle of bilateral application
which seems to represent a tactical differentiation between Japanese bujutsu
and the martial arts of the West. Lafcadio Hearn, for example, considered this
principle "a uniquely Oriental idea," asking, "What Western brain could have
elaborated this strange teaching: never to oppose force to force, but only to
direct and utilize the power of attack; to overthrow the enemy solely by his
own strength--to vanquish him solely by his own efforts?" (Smith,
128)...Takuan, writing about the art of swordsmanship in particular, refers to
the strategic value of the bilateral principle in the strategy of counterattack
against an opponent, when he advised his pupil to "make use of his attack by
turning it on to himself. Then, his sword meant to kill you becomes your own
and the weapon will fall on the opponent himself. In Zen this is known as
'seizing the enemy's spear and using it as the weapon to kill him'" (Suzuki, 96)
The ancient schools of jujutsu were very empathetic on this subject.... JuJutsu
(literally "soft art"), as its name implies, is based upon the principle of
opposing softness or elasticity to hardness or stiffness. Its secret lies in
keeping one's body full of ki, with elasticity in one's limbs, and in being ever
on the alert to turn the strength of one's foe to one's own advantage with the
minimum employment of one's own muscular force.

However desperate the situation and circumstances, don't despair. When
there is everything to fear, be unafraid. When surrounded by dangers, fear
none of them. When without resources, depend on resourcefulness. When
surprised, take the enemy itself by surprise.

JUJITSU
In 1920 the Democratic Party nominated Ohio governor James Cox as its
candidate to succeed the retiring President Woodrow Wilson. At the same time,
it named thirty-eight-year-old Franklin Delano Roosevelt as its vice presidential
nominee. Roosevelt had served as the assistant secretary of the navy under
Wilson; more important, he was the cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, still very
popular after his presidency in the first decade of the century.
The Republican nominee was Warren G. Harding, and the campaign was a
grueling affair. The Republicans had a lot of money; they avoided talking about
the issues and played up Harding's folksy image. Cox and Roosevelt responded
to the Republicans by going on a vigorous offensive, basing their campaign on a
single issue of Wilson's: American participation in the League of Nations, which
they hoped would bring peace and prosperity. Roosevelt campaigned all over the
country, delivering speech after speech--the idea was to counter the Republicans'
money with sheer effort. But the race was a disaster: Harding won the
presidency in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history.
The following year, Roosevelt was stricken with polio and lost the use of his
legs. Coming just after the disastrous 1920 campaign, his illness marked a
turning point in his life: suddenly made aware of his physical fragility and
mortality, he retreated into himself and reassessed. The world of politics was
vicious and violent. To win an election, people would do anything, stooping to
all kinds of personal attacks. The public official moving in this world was under
pressure to be as unscrupulous as everyone else and survive as best he could--but
that approach did not suit Roosevelt personally and took too much out of him
physically. He decided to craft a different political style, one that would separate
him from the crowd and give him a constant advantage.
In 1932, after a stint as governor of New York, Roosevelt ran as the
Democratic presidential nominee against the Republican incumbent, Herbert
Hoover. The country was in the midst of the Depression, and Hoover seemed
incapable of dealing with it. Given the weakness of his record, a defensive hand
was a difficult one for him to play, and, like the Democrats in 1920, he went
