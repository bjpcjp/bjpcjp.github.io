DECLARE WAR ON YOUR ENEMIES
THE POLARITY STRATEGY
Life is endless battle and conflict, and you cannot fight effectively unless you can
identify your enemies. People are subtle and evasive, disguising their intentions,
pretending to be on your side. You need clarity. Learn to smoke out your
enemies, to spot them by the signs and patterns that reveal hostility. Then, once
you have them in your sights, inwardly declare war. As the opposite poles of a
magnet create motion, your enemies--your opposites--can fill you with purpose
and direction. As people who stand in your way, who represent what you loathe,
people to react against, they are a source of energy. Do not be naive: with some
enemies there can be no compromise, no middle ground.
Then [Xenophon] got up, and first called together the under-officers of
Proxenos. When they were collected he said: "Gentlemen, I cannot sleep and
I don't think you can; and I can't lie here when I see what a plight we are in.
It is clear that the enemy did not show us open war until they thought they
had everything well prepared; and no-one among us takes the pains to make
the best possible resistance. "Yet if we give way, and fall into the king's power,
what do we expect our fate will be? When his own half-brother was dead, the
man cut off his head and cut off his hand and stuck them up on a pole. We
have no-one to plead for us, and we marched here to make the king a slave or
to kill him if we could, and what do you think our fate will be? Would he not
go to all extremes of torture to make the whole world afraid of making war on
him? Why, we must do anything to keep out of his power! While the truce
lasted, I never ceased pitying ourselves, I never ceased congratulating the
king and his army. What a vast country I saw, how large, what endless
provisions, what crowds of servants, how many cattle and sheep, what gold,
what raiment! But when I thought of these our soldiers--we had no share in
all these good things unless we bought them, and few had anything left to buy
with; and to procure anything without buying was debarred by our oaths.
While I reasoned like this, I sometimes feared the truce more than the war
now. "However, now they have broken the truce, there is an end both to their
insolence and to our suspicion. There lie all these good things before us,
prizes for whichever side prove the better men; the gods are the judges of the
contest, and they will be with us, naturally.... "When you have appointed as
many commanders as are wanted, assemble all the other soldiers and
encourage them; that will be just what they want now. Perhaps you have
noticed yourselves how crestfallen they were when they came into camp, how
crestfallen they went on guard; in such a state I don't know what you could do
with them.... But if someone could turn their minds from wondering what will
happen to them, and make them wonder what they could do, they will be
much more cheerful. You know, I am sure, that not numbers or strength brings
victory in war; but whichever army goes into battle stronger in soul, their
enemies generally cannot withstand them."
 
ANABASIS: THE MARCH UP COUNTRY, XENOPHON, 430?-355? B.C.
THE INNER ENEMY
In the spring of 401 B.C., Xenophon, a thirty-year-old country gentleman who
lived outside Athens, received an intriguing invitation: a friend was recruiting
Greek soldiers to fight as mercenaries for Cyrus, brother of the Persian king
Ataxerxes, and asked him to go along. The request was somewhat unusual: the
Greeks and the Persians had long been bitter enemies. Some eighty years earlier,
in fact, Persia had tried to conquer Greece. But the Greeks, renowned fighters,
had begun to offer their services to the highest bidder, and within the Persian
Empire there were rebellious cities that Cyrus wanted to punish. Greek
mercenaries would be the perfect reinforcements in his large army.
Xenophon was not a soldier. In fact, he had led a coddled life, raising dogs
and horses, traveling into Athens to talk philosophy with his good friend
Socrates, living off his inheritance. He wanted adventure, though, and here he
had a chance to meet the great Cyrus, learn war, see Persia. Perhaps when it was
all over, he would write a book. He would go not as a mercenary (he was too
wealthy for that) but as a philosopher and historian. After consulting the oracle
at Delphi, he accepted the invitation.
Some 10,000 Greek soldiers joined Cyrus's punitive expedition. The
mercenaries were a motley crew from all over Greece, there for the money and
the adventure. They had a good time of it for a while, but a few months into the
job, after leading them deep into Persia, Cyrus admitted his true purpose: he was
marching on Babylon, mounting a civil war to unseat his brother and make
himself king. Unhappy to be deceived, the Greeks argued and complained, but
Cyrus offered them more money, and that quieted them.
The armies of Cyrus and Ataxerxes met on the plains of Cunaxa, not far
from Babylon. Early in the battle, Cyrus was killed, putting a quick end to the
war. Now the Greeks' position was suddenly precarious: having fought on the
wrong side of a civil war, they were far from home and surrounded by hostile
Persians. They were soon told, however, that Ataxerxes had no quarrel with
them. His only desire was that they leave Persia as quickly as possible. He even
sent them an envoy, the Persian commander Tissaphernes, to provision them and
escort them back to Greece. And so, guided by Tissaphernes and the Persian
army, the mercenaries began the long trek home--some fifteen hundred miles.
A few days into the march, the Greeks had new fears: their supplies from the
Persians were insufficient, and the route that Tissaphernes had chosen for them
was problematic. Could they trust these Persians? They started to argue among
themselves.
The Greek commander Clearchus expressed his soldiers' concerns to
Tissaphernes, who was sympathetic: Clearchus should bring his captains to a
meeting at a neutral site, the Greeks would voice their grievances, and the two
sides would come to an understanding. Clearchus agreed and appeared the next
day with his officers at the appointed time and place--where, however, a large
contingent of Persians surrounded and arrested them. They were beheaded that
same day.
One man managed to escape and warn the Greeks of the Persian treachery.
That evening the Greek camp was a desolate place. Some men argued and
accused; others slumped drunk to the ground. A few considered flight, but with
their leaders dead, they felt doomed.
That night Xenophon, who had stayed mostly on the sidelines during the
expedition, had a dream: a lightning bolt from Zeus set fire to his father's house.
He woke up in a sweat. It suddenly struck him: death was staring the Greeks in
the face, yet they lay around moaning, despairing, arguing. The problem was in
their heads. Fighting for money rather than for a purpose or cause, unable to
distinguish between friend and foe, they had gotten lost. The barrier between
them and home was not rivers or mountains or the Persian army but their own
muddled state of mind. Xenophon didn't want to die in this disgraceful way. He
was no military man, but he knew philosophy and the way men think, and he
believed that if the Greeks concentrated on the enemies who wanted to kill them,
they would become alert and creative. If they focused on the vile treachery of the
Persians, they would grow angry, and their anger would motivate them. They
had to stop being confused mercenaries and go back to being Greeks, the polar
opposite of the faithless Persians. What they needed was clarity and direction.
Xenophon decided to be Zeus's lightning bolt, waking the men up and
illuminating their way. He called a meeting of all the surviving officers and
stated his plan: We will declare war without parley on the Persians--no more
thoughts of bargaining or debate. We will waste no more time on argument or
accusation among ourselves; every ounce of our energy will be spent on the
Persians. We will be as inventive and inspired as our ancestors at Marathon, who
fought off a vastly larger Persian army. We will burn our wagons, live off the
land, move fast. We will not for one second lay down our arms or forget the
dangers around us. It is us or them, life or death, good or evil. Should any man
try to confuse us with clever talk or with vague ideas of appeasement, we will
declare him too stupid and cowardly to be on our side and we will drive him
away. Let the Persians make us merciless. We must be consumed with one idea:
getting home alive.
The officers knew that Xenophon was right. The next day a Persian officer
came to see them, offering to act as an ambassador between them and Ataxerxes;
following Xenophon's counsel, he was quickly and rudely driven away. It was
now war and nothing else.
Roused to action, the Greeks elected leaders, Xenophon among them, and
began the march home. Forced to depend on their wits, they quickly learned to
adapt to the terrain, to avoid battle, to move at night. They successfully eluded
the Persians, beating them to a key mountain pass and moving through it before
they could be caught. Although many enemy tribes still lay between them and
Greece, the dreaded Persian army was now behind them. It took several years,
but almost all of them returned to Greece alive.
Political thought and political instinct prove themselves theoretically and
practically in the ability to distinguish friend and enemy. The high points of
politics are simultaneously the moments in which the enemy is, in concrete
clarity, recognized as the enemy.
CARL SCHMITT, 1888-1985
Interpretation
Life is battle and struggle, and you will constantly find yourself facing bad
situations, destructive relationships, dangerous engagements. How you confront
these difficulties will determine your fate. As Xenophon said, your obstacles are
not rivers or mountains or other people; your obstacle is yourself. If you feel lost
and confused, if you lose your sense of direction, if you cannot tell the difference
between friend and foe, you have only yourself to blame.
Think of yourself as always about to go into battle. Everything depends on
your frame of mind and on how you look at the world. A shift of perspective can
transform you from a passive and confused mercenary into a motivated and
creative fighter.
We are defined by our relationship to other people. As children we develop
an identity by differentiating ourselves from others, even to the point of pushing
them away, rejecting them, rebelling. The more clearly you recognize who you
do not want to be, then, the clearer your sense of identity and purpose will be.
Without a sense of that polarity, without an enemy to react against, you are as
lost as the Greek mercenaries. Duped by other people's treachery, you hesitate at
the fatal moment and descend into whining and argument.
Focus on an enemy. It can be someone who blocks your path or sabotages
you, whether subtly or obviously; it can be someone who has hurt you or
someone who has fought you unfairly; it can be a value or an idea that you
loathe and that you see in an individual or group. It can be an abstraction:
stupidity, smugness, vulgar materialism. Do not listen to people who say that the
distinction between friend and enemy is primitive and passe. They are just
disguising their fear of conflict behind a front of false warmth. They are trying to
push you off course, to infect you with the vagueness that inflicts them. Once
you feel clear and motivated, you will have space for true friendship and true
compromise. Your enemy is the polar star that guides you. Given that direction,
you can enter battle.
He that is not with me is against me.
--Luke 11:23
THE OUTER ENEMY
In the early 1970s, the British political system had settled into a comfortable
pattern: the Labour Party would win an election, and then, the next time around,
the Conservatives would win. Back and forth the power went, all fairly genteel
and civilized. In fact, the two parties had come to resemble one another. But
when the Conservatives lost in 1974, some of them had had enough. Wanting to
shake things up, they proposed Margaret Thatcher as their leader. The party was
divided that year, and Thatcher took advantage of the split and won the
nomination.
I am by nature warlike. To attack is among my instincts. To be able to be an
enemy, to be an enemy--that presupposes a strong nature, it is in any event a
condition of every strong nature. It needs resistances, consequently it seeks
resistances.... The strength of one who attacks has in the opposition he needs
a kind of gauge; every growth reveals itself in the seeking out of a powerful
opponent--or problem: for a philosopher who is warlike also challenges
problems to a duel. The undertaking is to master, not any resistances that
happen to present themselves, but those against which one has to bring all
one's strength, suppleness and mastery of weapons--to master equal
opponents.
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1844-1900
No one had ever seen a politician quite like Thatcher. A woman in a world
run by men, she was also proudly middle class--the daughter of a grocer--in the
traditional party of the aristocracy. Her clothes were prim, more like a
housewife's than a politician's. She had not been a player in the Conservative
Party; in fact, she was on its right-wing fringes. Most striking of all was her
style: where other politicians were smooth and conciliatory, she confronted her
opponents, attacking them directly. She had an appetite for battle.
Most politicians saw Thatcher's election as a fluke and didn't expect her to
last. And in her first few years leading the party, when Labour was in power, she
did little to change their opinion. She railed against the socialist system, which in
her mind had choked all initiative and was largely responsible for the decline of
the British economy. She criticized the Soviet Union at a time of detente. Then,
in the winter of 1978-79, several public-sector unions decided to strike. Thatcher
went on the warpath, linking the strikes to the Labour Party and Prime Minister
James Callaghan. This was bold, divisive talk, good for making the evening
news--but not for winning elections. You had to be gentle with the voters,
reassure them, not frighten them. At least that was the conventional wisdom.
In 1979 the Labour Party called a general election. Thatcher kept on the
attack, categorizing the election as a crusade against socialism and as Great
Britain's last chance to modernize. Callaghan was the epitome of the genteel
politician, but Thatcher got under his skin. He had nothing but disdain for this
housewife-turned-politician, and he returned her fire: he agreed that the election
was a watershed, for if Thatcher won, she would send the economy into shock.
The strategy seemed partly to work; Thatcher scared many voters, and the polls
that tracked personal popularity showed that her numbers had fallen well below
Callaghan's. At the same time, though, her rhetoric, and Callaghan's response to
it, polarized the electorate, which could finally see a sharp difference between
the parties. Dividing the public into left and right, she charged into the breach,
sucking in attention and attracting the undecided. She won a sizable victory.
Thatcher had bowled over the voters, but now, as prime minister, she would
have to moderate her tone, heal the wounds--according to the polls, at any rate,
that was what the public wanted. But Thatcher as usual did the opposite,
enacting budget cuts that went even deeper than she had proposed during the
campaign. As her policies played out, the economy did indeed go into shock, as
Callaghan had said it would, and unemployment soared. Men in her own party,
many of whom had by that point been resenting her treatment of them for years,
began publicly to question her abilities. These men, whom she called the "wets,"
were the most respected members of the Conservative Party, and they were in a
panic: she was leading the country into an economic disaster that they were
afraid they would pay for with their careers. Thatcher's response was to purge
them from her cabinet. She seemed bent on pushing everyone away; her legion
of enemies was growing, her poll numbers slipping still lower. Surely the next
election would be her last.
[Salvador Dali] had no time for those who did not agree with his principles,
and took the war into the enemy camp by writing insulting letters to many of
the friends he had made in the Residencia, calling them pigs. He happily
compared himself to a clever bull avoiding the cowboys and generally had a
great deal of fun stirring up and scandalizing almost every Catalan
intellectual worthy of the name. Dali was beginning to burn his bridges with
the zeal of an arsonist.... "We [Dali and the filmmaker Luis Bunuel] had
resolved to send a poison pen letter to one of the great celebrities of Spain,"
Dali later told his biographer Alain Bosquet. "Our goal was pure
subversion.... Both of us were strongly influenced by Nietzsche.... We hit upon
two names: Manuel de Falla, the composer, and Juan Ramon Jimenez, the
poet. We drew straws and Jimenez won.... So we composed a frenzied and
nasty letter of incomparable violence and addressed it to Juan Ramon
Jimenez. It read: 'Our Distinguished Friend: We believe it is our duty to
inform you--disinterestedly--that your work is deeply repugnant to us because
of its immorality, its hysteria, its arbitrary quality....' It caused Jimenez great
pain...."

ETHERINGTON-SMITH, 1992
Then, in 1982, on the other side of the Atlantic, the military junta that ruled
Argentina, needing a cause to distract the country from its many problems,
invaded the Falkland Islands, a British possession to which, however, Argentina
had a historical claim. The officers of the junta felt certain that the British would
abandon these islands, barren and remote. But Thatcher did not hesitate: despite
the distance--eight thousand miles--she sent a naval task force to the Falklands.
Labour leaders attacked her for this pointless and costly war. Many in her own
party were terrified; if the attempt to retake the islands failed, the party would be
ruined. Thatcher was more alone than ever. But much of the public now saw her
qualities, which had seemed so irritating, in a new light: her obstinacy became
courage, nobility. Compared to the dithering, pantywaisted, careerist men around
her, Thatcher seemed resolute and confident.
The British successfully won back the Falklands, and Thatcher stood taller
than ever. Suddenly the country's economic and social problems were forgotten.
Thatcher now dominated the scene, and in the next two elections she crushed
Labour.
Interpretation
Margaret Thatcher came to power as an outsider: a middle-class woman, a right-
wing radical. The first instinct of most outsiders who attain power is to become
insiders--life on the outside is hard--but in doing so they lose their identity, their
difference, the thing that makes them stand out in the public eye. If Thatcher had
become like the men around her, she would simply have been replaced by yet
another man. Her instinct was to stay an outsider. In fact, she pushed being an
outsider as far as it could go: she set herself up as one woman against an army of
men.
At every step of the way, to give her the contrast she needed, Thatcher
marked out an opponent: the socialists, the wets, the Argentineans. These
enemies helped to define her image as determined, powerful, self-sacrificing.
Thatcher was not seduced by popularity, which is ephemeral and superficial.
Pundits might obsess over popularity numbers, but in the mind of the voter--
which, for a politician, is the field of battle--a dominating presence has more pull
than does likability. Let some of the public hate you; you cannot please
everyone. Your enemies, those you stand sha
