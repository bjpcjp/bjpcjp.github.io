THE DEATH-GROUND STRATEGY
You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future
instead of engaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you are
only half involved in what you do. The only way to change is through action and
outside pressure. Put yourself in situations where you have too much at stake to
waste time or resources--if you cannot afford to lose, you won't. Cut your ties to
the past; enter unknown territory where you must depend on your wits and
energy to see you through. Place yourself on "death ground," where your back is
against the wall and you have to fight like hell to get out alive.
Cortes ran all that aground with the ten ships. Cuba, to be sure, was still
there, in the blue sea, with its farms, its cows and its tame Indians; but the
way to Cuba was no longer through sunny blue waves, rocked in soft idleness,
oblivious of danger and endeavor; it was through Motecucuma's court, which
had to be conquered by ruse, by force, or by both; through a sea of warlike
Indians who ate their prisoners and donned their skins as trophies; at the
stroke of their chief's masterly hand, the five hundred men had lost that flow
of vital memories and hopes which linked up their souls with their mother-
island; at one stroke, their backs had been withered and had lost all sense of
life. Henceforward, for them, all life was ahead, towards those forbidding
peaks which rose gigantically on the horizon as if to bar all access to what
was now not merely their ambition, but their only possible aim--Mexico,
mysterious and powerful behind the conflicting tribes.
HERNAN CORTES: CONQUEROR OF MEXICO, SALVADOR DE
MADARIAGA, 1942
THE NO-RETURN TACTIC
In 1504 an ambitious nineteen-year-old Spaniard named Hernan Cortes gave up
his studies in law and sailed for his country's colonies in the New World.
Stopping first in Santo Domingo (the island today comprising Haiti and the
Dominican Republic), then in Cuba, he soon heard about a land to the west
called Mexico--an empire teeming with gold and dominated by the Aztecs, with
their magnificent highland capital of Tenochtitlan. From then on, Cortes had just
one thought: someday he would conquer and settle the land of Mexico.
Over the next ten years, Cortes slowly rose through the ranks, eventually
becoming secretary to the Spanish governor of Cuba and then the king's treasurer
for the island. In his own mind, though, he was merely biding his time. He
waited patiently while Spain sent other men to Mexico, many of them never to
return.
Finally, in 1518, the governor of Cuba, Diego de Velazquez, made Cortes the
leader of an expedition to discover what had happened to these earlier explorers,
find gold, and lay the groundwork for the country's conquest. Velazquez wanted
to make that future conquest himself, however, so for this expedition he wanted
a man he could control, and he soon developed doubts about Cortes--the man
was clever, perhaps too much so. Word reached Cortes that the governor was
having second thoughts about sending him to Mexico. Deciding to give
Velazquez no time to nurse his misgivings, he managed to slip out of Cuba in the
middle of the night with eleven ships. He would explain himself to the governor
later.
The expedition landed on Mexico's east coast in March 1519. Over the next
few months, Cortes put his plans to work--founding the town of Veracruz,
forging alliances with local tribes who hated the Aztecs, and making initial
contact with the Aztec emperor, whose capital lay some 250 miles to the west.
But one problem plagued the conquistador: among the 500 soldiers who had
sailed with him from Cuba were a handful who had been placed there by
Velazquez to act as spies and make trouble for him if he exceeded his authority.
These Velazquez loyalists accused Cortes of mismanaging the gold that he was
collecting, and when it became clear that he intended to conquer Mexico, they
spread rumors that he was insane--an all-too-convincing accusation to make
about a man planning to lead 500 men against half a million Aztecs, fierce
warriors known to eat their prisoners' flesh and wear the skins as trophies. A
rational man would take the gold they had, return to Cuba, and come back later
with an army. Why stay in this forbidding land, with its diseases and its lack of
creature comforts, when they were so heavily outnumbered? Why not sail for
Cuba, back home where their farms, their wives, and the good life awaited them?
Cortes did what he could with these troublemakers, bribing some, keeping a
close eye on others. Meanwhile he worked to build a strong enough rapport with
the rest of his men that the grumblers could do no harm. All seemed well until
the night of July 30, when Cortes was awoken by a Spanish sailor who, begging
for mercy, confessed that he had joined in a plot to steal a ship and return that
very evening to Cuba, where the conspirators would tell Velazquez about
Cortes's goal of conquering Mexico on his own.
Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when
one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped
apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging
waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, bring struck by lightning,
being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs,
dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And
every day without fail one should consider himself as dead.

TSUNETOMO, 1659-1720
Cortes sensed that this was the decisive moment of the expedition. He could
easily squash the conspiracy, but there would be others. His men were a rough
lot, and their minds were on gold, Cuba, their families--anything but fighting the
Aztecs. He could not conquer an empire with men so divided and untrustworthy,
but how to fill them with the energy and focus for the immense task he faced?
Thinking this through, he decided to take swift action. He seized the conspirators
and had the two ringleaders hanged. Next, he bribed his pilots to bore holes in all
of the ships and then announce that worms had eaten through the boards of the
vessels, making them unseaworthy.
Pretending to be upset at the news, Cortes ordered what was salvageable
from the ships to be taken ashore and then the hulls to be sunk. The pilots
complied, but not enough holes had been bored, and only five of the ships went
down. The story of the worms was plausible enough, and the soldiers accepted
the news of the five ships with equanimity. But when a few days later more ships
were run aground and only one was left afloat, it was clear to them that Cortes
had arranged the whole thing. When he called a meeting, their mood was
mutinous and murderous.
This was no time for subtlety. Cortes addressed his men: he was responsible
for the disaster, he admitted; he had ordered it done, but now there was no
turning back. They could hang him, but they were surrounded by hostile Indians
and had no ships; divided and leaderless, they would perish. The only alternative
was to follow him to Tenochtitlan. Only by conquering the Aztecs, by becoming
lords of Mexico, could they get back to Cuba alive. To reach Tenochtitlan they
would have to fight with utter intensity. They would have to be unified; any
dissension would lead to defeat and a terrible death. The situation was desperate,
but if the men fought desperately in turn, Cortes guaranteed that he would lead
them to victory. Since the army was so small in number, the glory and riches
would be all the greater. Any cowards not up to the challenge could sail the one
remaining ship home.
There is something in war that drives so deeply into you that death ceases to
be the enemy, merely another participant in a game you don't wish to end.
PHANTOM OVER VIETNAM, JOHN TROTTI, USMC, 1984
No one accepted the offer, and the last ship was run aground. Over the next
months, Cortes kept his army away from Veracruz and the coast. Their attention
was focused on Tenochtitlan, the heart of the Aztec empire. The grumbling, the
self-interest, and the greed all disappeared. Understanding the danger of their
situation, the conquistadors fought ruthlessly. Some two years after the
destruction of the Spanish ships, and with the help of their Indian allies, Cortes's
army laid siege to Tenochtitlan and conquered the Aztec empire.
"You don't have time for this display, you fool," he said in a severe tone.
"This, whatever you're doing now, may be your last act on earth. It may very
well be your last battle. There is no power which could guarantee that you
are going to live one more minute...." "...Acts have power," he said,
"Especially when the person acting knows that those acts are his last battle.
There is a strange consuming happiness in acting with the full knowledge that
whatever one is doing may very well be one's last act on earth. I recommend
that you reconsider your life and bring your acts into that light.... Focus your
attention on the link between you and your death, without remorse or sadness
or worrying. Focus your attention on the fact you don't have time and let your
acts flow accordingly. Let each of your acts be your last battle on earth. Only
under those conditions will your acts have their rightful power. Otherwise
they will be, for as long as you live, the acts of a timid man." "Is it so terrible
to be a timid man?" "No. It isn't if you are going to be immortal, but if you
are going to die there is not time for timidity, simply because timidity makes
you cling to something that exists only in your thoughts. It soothes you while
everything is at a lull, but then the awesome, mysterious world will open its
mouth for you, as it will open for every one of us, and then you will realize
that your sure ways were not sure at all. Being timid prevents us from
examining and exploiting our lot as men."
JOURNEY TO IXTLAN: THE LESSONS OF DON JUAN, CARLOS
CASTANEDA, 1972
Interpretation On the night of the conspiracy, Cortes had to think fast. What
was the root of the problem he faced? It was not Velazquez's spies, or the hostile
Aztecs, or the incredible odds against him. The root of the problem was his own
men and the ships in the harbor. His soldiers were divided in heart and mind.
They were thinking about the wrong things--their wives, their dreams of gold,
their plans for the future. And in the backs of their minds there was always an
escape route: if this conquest business went badly, they could go home. Those
ships in the harbor were more than just transportation; they represented Cuba,
the freedom to leave, the ability to send for reinforcements--so many
possibilities.
For the soldiers the ships were a crutch, something to fall back on if things
got ugly. Once Cortes had identified the problem, the solution was simple:
destroy the ships. By putting his men in a desperate place, he would make them
fight with utmost intensity.
A sense of urgency comes from a powerful connection to the present. Instead
of dreaming of rescue or hoping for a better future, you have to face the issue at
hand. Fail and you perish. People who involve themselves completely in the
immediate problem are intimidating; because they are focusing so intensely, they
seem more powerful than they are. Their sense of urgency multiplies their
strength and gives them momentum. Instead of five hundred men, Cortes
suddenly had the weight of a much larger army at his back.
Like Cortes you must locate the root of your problem. It is not the people
around you; it is yourself, and the spirit with which you face the world. In the
back of your mind, you keep an escape route, a crutch, something to turn to if
things go bad. Maybe it is some wealthy relative you can count on to buy your
way out; maybe it is some grand opportunity on the horizon, the endless vistas of
time that seem to be before you; maybe it is a familiar job or a comfortable
relationship that is always there if you fail. Just as Cortes's men saw their ships
as insurance, you may see this fallback as a blessing--but in fact it is a curse. It
divides you. Because you think you have options, you never involve yourself
deeply enough in one thing to do it thoroughly, and you never quite get what you
want. Sometimes you need to run your ships aground, burn them, and leave
yourself just one option: succeed or go down. Make the burning of your ships as
real as possible--get rid of your safety net. Sometimes you have to become a
little desperate to get anywhere.
The ancient commanders of armies, who well knew the powerful influence of
necessity, and how it inspired the soldiers with the most desperate courage,
neglected nothing to subject their men to such a pressure.
--Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)
THE DEATH-AT-YOUR-HEELS TACTIC
In 1845 the writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky, then twenty-four, shook the Russian
literary world with the publication of his first novel, Poor Folk. He became the
toast of St. Petersburg society. But something about his early fame seemed
empty to him. He drifted into the fringes of left-wing politics, attending meetings
of various socialist and radical groups. One of these groups centered on the
charismatic Mikhail Petrashevsky.
Three years later, in 1848, revolution broke out all across Europe. Inspired
by what was happening in the West, Russian radical groups like Petrashevsky's
talked of following suit. But agents of Czar Nicholas I had infiltrated many of
these groups, and reports were written about the wild things being discussed at
Petrashevsky's house, including talk of inciting peasant revolts. Dostoyevsky
was fervent about freeing the serfs, and on April 23, 1849, he and twenty-three
other members of the Petrashevsky group were arrested.
After eight months of languishing in jail, the prisoners were awakened one
cold morning and told that today they would finally hear their sentences. A few
months' exile was the usual punishment for their crime; soon, they thought, their
ordeal would be over.
They were bundled into carriages and driven through the icy streets of St.
Petersburg. Emerging from the carriages into Semyonovsky Square, they were
greeted by a priest; behind him they could see rows of soldiers and, behind the
soldiers, thousands of spectators. They were led toward a scaffold covered in
black cloth at the center of the square. In front of the scaffold were three posts,
and to the side was a line of carts laden with coffins.
Lord Naoshige said, "The Way of the Samurai is in desperateness. Ten men or
more cannot kill such a man. Common sense will not accomplish great things.
Simply become insane and desperate."

TSUNETOMO, 1659-1720
Dostoyevsky could not believe what he saw. "It's not possible that they mean
to execute us," he whispered to his neighbor. They were marched to the scaffold
and placed in two lines. It was an unbelievably cold day, and the prisoners were
wearing the light clothes they'd been arrested in back in April. A drumroll
sounded. An officer came forward to read their sentences: "All of the accused
are guilty as charged of intending to overthrow the national order, and are
therefore condemned to death before a firing squad." The prisoners were too
stunned to speak.
As the officer read out the individual charges and sentences, Dostoyevsky
found himself staring at the golden spire of a nearby church and at the sunlight
bouncing off it. The gleams of light disappeared as a cloud passed overhead, and
the thought occurred to him that he was about to pass into darkness just as
quickly, and forever. Suddenly he had another thought: If I do not die, if I am not
killed, my life will suddenly seem endless, a whole eternity, each minute a
century. I will take account of everything that passes--I will not waste a second
of life again.
The prisoners were given hooded shirts. The priest came forward to read
them their last rites and hear their confessions. They said good-bye to one
another. The first three to be shot were tied to the posts, and the hoods were
pulled over their faces. Dostoyevsky stood in the front, in the next group to go.
The soldiers raised their rifles, took aim--and suddenly a carriage came galloping
into the square. A man got out with an envelope. At the last second, the czar had
commuted their death sentences.
It had long been known, of course, that a man who, through disciplined
training, had relinquished any desire or hope for survival and had only one
goal--the destruction of his enemy--could be a redoubtable opponent and a
truly formidable fighter who neither asked nor offered any quarter once his
weapon had been unsheathed. In this way, a seemingly ordinary man who, by
the force of circumstances rather than by profession, had been placed in the
position of having to make a desperate choice, could prove dangerous, even
to a skilled fencing master. One famous episode, for example, concerns a
teacher of swordsmanship who was asked by a superior to surrender a
servant guilty of an offense punishable by death. This teacher, wishing to test
a theory of his concerning the power of that condition we would call
"desperation," challenged the doomed man to a duel. Knowing full well the
irrevocability of his sentence, the servant was beyond caring one way or the
other, and the ensuing duel proved that even a skilled fencer and teacher of
the art could find himself in great difficulty when confronted by a man who,
because of his acceptance of imminent death, could go to the limit (and even
beyond) in his strategy, without a single hesitation or distracting
consideration. The servant, in fact, fought like a man possessed, forcing his
master to retreat until his back was almost to the wall. At last the teacher had
to cut him down in a final effort, wherein the master's own desperation
brought about the fullest coordination of his courage, skill, and
determination.
SECRETS OF THE SAMURAI, OSCAR RATTI AND ADELE
WESTBROOK, 1973
Later that morning, Dostoyevsky was told his new sentence: four years hard
labor in Siberia, to be followed by a stint in the army. Barely affected, he wrote
that day to his brother, "When I look back at the past and think of all the time I
squandered in error and idleness,...then my heart bleeds. Life is a gift...every
minute could have been an eternity of happiness! If youth only knew! Now my
life will change; now I will be reborn."
A few days later, ten-pound shackles were put on Dostoyevsky's arms and
legs--they would stay there for the length of his prison term--and he was carted
off to Siberia. For the next four years, he endured the most abysmal prison
conditions. Granted no writing privileges, he wrote novels in his head,
memorized them. Finally, in 1857, still serving the army period of his sentence,
he was allowed to start publishing his work. Where before he would torture
himself over a page, spend half a day idling it away in thought, now he wrote
and wrote. Friends would see him walking the streets of St. Petersburg
mumbling bits of dialogue to himself, lost in his characters and plots. His new
motto was "Try to get as much done as possible in the shortest time."
Some pitied Dostoyevsky his time in prison. That made him angry; he was
grateful for the experience and felt no bitterness. But for that December day in
1849, he felt, he would have wasted his life. Right up until his death, in 1881, he
continued writing at a frantic pace, churning out novel after novel--Crime and
Punishment, The Possessed, The Brothers Karamazov--as if each one were his
last.
 
Interpretation Czar Nicholas had decided to sentence the Petrashevsky radicals
to hard labor soon after their arrest. But he wanted to teach them a harsher lesson
as well, so he dreamed up the cruel theater of the death sentence, with its careful
details--the priest, the hoods, the coffins, the last-second pardon. This, he
thought, would
