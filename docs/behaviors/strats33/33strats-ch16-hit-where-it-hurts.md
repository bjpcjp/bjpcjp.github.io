HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS
THE CENTER-OF-GRAVITY STRATEGY
Everyone has a source of power on which he or she depends. When you look at
your rivals, search below the surface for that source, the center of gravity that
holds the entire structure together. That center can be their wealth, their
popularity, a key position, a winning strategy. Hitting them there will inflict
disproportionate pain. Find what the other side most cherishes and protects--
that is where you must strike.
Man depends on his throat for fluent breathing and the maintenance of life.
When his throat is strangled, his five sense organs will lose their sensibility
and no longer function normally. He will not be able to stretch his limbs,
which become numb and paralyzed. The man can therefore rarely survive.
Thus, when the banners of the enemy come into sight and the beating of its
battle drums can be heard, we must first ascertain the positions of its back
and throat. Then we can attack it from the back and strangle its throat. This is
an excellent strategy to crush the enemy.
THE WILES OF WAR: 36 MILITARY STRATEGIES FROM ANCIENT
CHINA, TRANSLATED BY SUN HAICHEN, 1991
PILLARS OF COLLAPSE
In 210 B.C. a young Roman general named Publius Scipio the Younger (later
called Scipio Africanus) was sent to northeastern Spain with a simple mission: to
hold the Ebro River against the powerful Carthaginian armies that were
threatening to cross it and take control of the peninsula. This was Scipio's first
assignment as commander, and as he looked out on the river and plotted his
strategy, he felt a strange mix of emotions.
Eight years earlier the great Carthaginian commander Hannibal had crossed
this river heading north. Onward he had gone into Gaul and then, catching the
Romans by surprise, had crossed the Alps into Italy. Scipio, only eighteen at the
time, had fought alongside his father, a general, in the first battles against
Hannibal on Italian soil. He had seen the North African's battlefield skills with
his own eyes: Hannibal had maneuvered his small army brilliantly, made
maximum use of his superior cavalry, and through inexhaustible creativity had
constantly managed to surprise the Romans and inflict on them a series of
humiliating defeats, culminating in the virtual annihilation of the Roman legions
at the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C. Matching wits with Hannibal, Scipio knew,
was futile. It had seemed back then that Rome itself was doomed.
Scipio also recalled two events after Cannae that had had an overwhelming
effect on him. First, a Roman general named Fabius had finally conceived a
strategy to keep Hannibal at bay. Keeping his legions in the hills and avoiding
direct battle, Fabius had launched hit-and-run raids designed to wear down the
Carthaginians, who were fighting far from their home, in what is now Tunisia.
The campaign had worked as a holding action, but to Scipio it had seemed
equally exhausting for the Romans to fight so long and still have the enemy at
their doorstep. Also, since the plan could not lead to any real defeat of Hannibal,
it was basically flawed.
Second, a year into Hannibal's invasion, the Romans had sent Scipio's father
to Spain to try to knock out the Carthaginian bases there. Carthage had had
colonies in Spain for many years and earned wealth from Spanish mines. It used
Spain as a training ground for its soldiers and as the base for its war on Rome.
For six years Scipio's father had fought the Carthaginians on the Spanish
peninsula, but the campaign had ended in his defeat and death in 211 B.C.
As Scipio studied the reports coming in about the situation beyond the Ebro,
a plan took root in his mind: with one bold maneuver, he could avenge his
father's death the year before, demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy he
thought far better than Fabius's, and set in motion the eventual collapse not just
of Hannibal but of Carthage itself. Along the coast to the south of him was the
city of New Carthage (present-day Cartagena), the Carthaginians' capital in
Spain. There they stored their vast wealth, their army's supplies, and the hostages
they had taken from different Spanish tribes to be held as ransom in case of
rebellion. At this moment the Carthaginian armies--which outnumbered the
Romans two to one--were scattered about the country, trying to gain further
domination over the Spanish tribes, and were all several days' march from New
Carthage. Their commanders, Scipio learned, had been quarreling among
themselves over power and money. Meanwhile New Carthage was garrisoned
with only 1,000 men.
The third shogun Iemitsu was fond of sword matches. Once, when he
arranged to see some of his outstanding swordsmen display their skills, he
spotted among the gathering a master equestrian by the name of Suwa
Bunkuro, and impulsively asked him to take part. Bunkuro responded by
saying that he would be pleased to if he could fight on horseback, adding that
he could defeat anyone on horseback. Iemitsu was delighted to urge the
swordsmen to fight Bunkuro in the style he preferred. As it turned out,
Bunkuro was right in his boasting. Brandishing a sword on a prancing horse
wasn't something many swordsmen were used to, and Bunkuro easily defeated
everyone who dared face him on horseback. Somewhat exasperated, Iemitsu
told Munenori to give it a try. Though a bystander on this occasion, Munenori
at once complied and mounted a horse. As his horse trotted up to Bunkuro's,
Munenori suddenly stopped his horse and slapped the nose of Bunkuro's
horse with his wooden sword. Bunkuro's horse reared, and while the famed
equestrian was trying to restore his balance, Munenori struck him off his
horse.
THE SWORD AND THE MIND, TRANSLATED BY HIROAKI SATO, 1985
Disobeying his orders to take his stand at the Ebro, Scipio advanced south by
ship and led a daring raid on New Carthage. This walled city was considered
impregnable, but he timed his attack for the ebbing of the tide in a lagoon on the
city's north side; there his men were able to scale the walls relatively easily, and
New Carthage was taken. In one move, Scipio had produced a dramatic
turnaround. Now the Romans commanded the central position in Spain; they had
the money and supplies on which the Carthaginians in Spain depended; and they
had Carthage's hostages, whom they now could use to stir revolt among the
conquered tribes. Over the next few years, Scipio exploited this position and
slowly brought Spain under Roman control.
In 205 B.C., Scipio returned to Rome a hero--but Hannibal was still a
menace in Italy's interior. Scipio now wanted to take the war to Africa, by
marching on Carthage itself. That was the only way to get Hannibal out of Italy
and finally erase Carthage as a threat. But Fabius was still the commander in
charge of Rome's strategy, and few saw the point of fighting Hannibal by waging
war so far from him, and from Rome. Yet Scipio's prestige was high, and the
Roman Senate finally gave him an army--a small, low-quality army--to use for
his campaign.
Wasting no time on arguing his case, Scipio proceeded to make an alliance
with Masinissa, king of the Massyles, Carthage's neighbors. Masinissa would
supply him with a large and well-trained cavalry. Then, in the spring of 204
B.C., Scipio sailed for Africa and landed near Utica, not far from Carthage.
Initially surprised, the Carthaginians rallied and were able to pin Scipio's troops
on a peninsula outside the town. The situation looked bleak. If Scipio could
somehow advance past the enemy troops that blocked his path, he would enter
the heart of the enemy state and gain control of the situation, but that seemed an
impossible task--he could not hope to fight his way past the tight Carthaginian
cordon; trapped where he was, his supplies would eventually run out, forcing
him to surrender. Scipio bargained for peace but used the negotiations as a way
to spy on the Carthaginian army.
Scipio's ambassadors told him that the enemy had two camps, one for its
own army and the other for its main ally, the Numidians, whose camp was rather
disorganized, a swarm of reed huts. The Carthaginian camp was more orderly
but made of the same combustible materials. Over the next few weeks, Scipio
seemed indecisive, first breaking off negotiations, then reopening them,
confusing the Carthaginians. Then one night he made a sneak attack on the
Numidian camp and set it on fire. The blaze spread quickly, and the African
soldiers panicked, scattering in every direction. Awakened by the hubbub, the
Carthaginians opened the gates to their own camp to come to their allies' rescue-
-but in the confusion the Romans were able to steal in and set fire to their camp
as well. The enemy lost half their army in this battle by night, the rest managing
to retreat to Numidia and Carthage.
Heracles did not return to Mycenae by a direct route. He first traversed
Libya, whose King Antaeus, son of Poseidon and Mother Earth, was in the
habit of forcing strangers to wrestle with him until they were exhausted,
whereupon he killed them; for not only was he a strong and skilful athlete, but
whenever he touched the earth, his strength revived. He saved the skulls of his
victims to roof a temple of Poseidon. It is not known whether Heracles, who
was determined to end this barbarous practice, challenged Antaeus, or was
challenged by him. Antaeus, however, proved no easy victim, being a giant
who lived in a cave beneath a towering cliff, where he feasted on the flesh of
lions, and slept on the bare ground in order to conserve and increase his
already colossal strength. Mother Earth, not yet sterile after her birth of the
Giant, had conceived Antaeus in a Libyan cave, and found more reason to
boast of him than even of her monstrous elder children, Typhon, Tityus, and
Briareus. It would have gone ill with the Olympians if he had fought against
them on the Plains of Phlegra. In preparation for the wrestling match, both
combatants cast off their lion pelts, but while Heracles rubbed himself with
oil in the Olympian fashion, Antaeus poured hot sand over his limbs lest
contact with the earth through the soles of his feet alone should prove
insufficient. Heracles planned to preserve his strength and wear Antaeus
down, but after tossing him full length on the ground, he was amazed to see
the giant's muscles swell and a healthy flush suffuse his limbs as Mother
Earth revived him. The combatants grappled again, and presently Antaeus
flung himself down of his own accord, not waiting to be thrown; upon which,
Heracles, realizing what he was at, lifted him high into the air, then cracked
his ribs and, despite the hollow groans of Mother Earth, held him aloft until
he died.
THE GREEK MYTHS, VOL. 2, ROBERT GRAVES, 1955
Suddenly the Carthaginian interior lay open to Scipio's army. He proceeded
to take town after town, advancing much as Hannibal had in Italy. Then he
landed a contingent of troops at the port of Tunis, within sight of Carthage's
walls. Now it was the Carthaginians' turn to panic, and Hannibal, their greatest
general, was immediately recalled. In 202 B.C., after sixteen years of fighting on
Rome's doorstep, Hannibal was finally compelled to leave Italy.
Hannibal landed his army to Carthage's south and made plans to fight Scipio.
But the Roman general retreated west, to the Bagradas Valley--the most fertile
farmlands of Carthage, its economic base. There he went on a rampage,
destroying everything in sight. Hannibal had wanted to fight near Carthage,
where he had shelter and material reinforcements. Instead he was compelled to
pursue Scipio before Carthage lost its richest territory. But Scipio kept retreating,
refusing battle until he had lured Hannibal to the town of Zama, where he
secured a solid position and forced Hannibal to camp in a place without water.
Now the two armies finally met in battle. Exhausted by their pursuit of Scipio,
their cavalry neutralized by Masinissa's, the Carthaginians were defeated, and
with no refuge close enough to retreat to, Hannibal was forced to surrender.
Carthage quickly sued for peace, and under the harsh terms imposed by Scipio
and the Senate, it was reduced to a client state of Rome. As a Mediterranean
power and a threat to Rome, Carthage was finished for good.
Interpretation
Often what separates a mediocre general from a superior one is not their
strategies or maneuvers but their vision--they simply look at the same problem
from a different angle. Freed from the stranglehold of convention, the superior
general naturally hits on the right strategy.
The Romans were dazzled by Hannibal's strategic genius. They came to so
fear him that the only strategies they could use against him were delay and
avoidance. Scipio Africanus simply saw differently. At every turn he looked not
at the enemy army, nor even at its leader, but at the pillar of support on which it
stood--its critical vulnerability. He understood that military power was located
not in the army itself but in its foundations, the things that supported it and made
it possible: money, supplies, public goodwill, allies. He found those pillars and
bit by bit knocked them down.
Scipio's first step was to see Spain, not Italy, as Hannibal's center of gravity.
Within Spain the key was New Carthage. He did not chase the various Roman
armies but took New Carthage and turned the war around. Now Hannibal,
deprived of his main military base and source of supply, would have to lean
more heavily on his other support base: Carthage itself, with its wealth and
resources. So Scipio took the war to Africa. Trapped near Utica, he examined
what gave the enemy its power in this situation, and saw that it was not the
armies themselves but the position they had taken: get them to move out of that
position without wasting men in a frontal battle and Carthage's soft underbelly
would be exposed. By burning the camps, Scipio moved the armies. Then,
instead of marching on the city of Carthage--a glittering prize that would have
drawn most generals like a magnet--he hit what would hurt the Carthaginian
state most: the fertile farming zone that was the source of its wealth. Finally,
instead of chasing Hannibal, he made Hannibal come after him, to an area in the
middle of the country where he would be deprived of reinforcements and
support. Now that Scipio had unbalanced the Carthaginians so completely, their
defeat at Zama was definitive.
Power is deceptive. If we imagine the enemy as a boxer, we tend to focus on
his punch. But still more than he depends on his punch, he depends on his legs;
once they go weak, he loses balance, he cannot escape the other fighter, he is
subject to grueling exchanges, and his punches gradually diminish in force until
he is knocked out. When you look at your rivals, do not be distracted by their
punch. To engage in any exchange of punches, in life or in war, is the height of
stupidity and waste. Power depends on balance and support; so look at what is
holding your enemy up, and remember that what holds him up can also make
him fall. A person, like an army, usually gets his or her power from three or four
simultaneous sources: money, popularity, skillful maneuvering, some particular
advantage he has fostered. Knock out one and he will have to depend more on
the others; knock out those and he is lost. Weaken a boxer's legs and he will reel
and stagger, and when he does, be merciless. No power can stand without its
legs.
When the vanes are removed from an arrow, even though the shaft and tip
remain it is difficult for the arrow to penetrate deeply.
--Ming dynasty strategist Chieh Hsuan (early seventeenth century A.D.)
KEYS TO WARFARE
It is natural in war to focus on the physical aspect of conflict--bodies, equipment,
materiel. Even an enlightened strategist will tend to look first at the enemy's
army, firepower, mobility, reserves. War is a visceral, emotional affair, an arena
of physical danger, and it takes great effort to rise above this level and ask
different questions: What makes the enemy army move? What gives it impetus
and endurance? Who guides its actions? What is the underlying source of its
strength?
The people of Israel cried out to the Lord their God, for their courage failed,
because all their enemies had surrounded them and there was no way of
escape from them. The whole Assyrian army, their infantry, chariots, and
cavalry, surrounded them for thirty-four days, until all the vessels of water
belonging to every inhabitant of Bethulia were empty.... Their children lost
heart, and the women and young men fainted from thirst and fell down in the
streets of the city and in the passages through the gates; there was no strength
left in them any longer.... When Judith had ceased crying out to the God of
Israel, and had ended all these words, she rose from where she lay prostrate
and called her maid and went down into the house where she lived on
sabbaths and on her feast days; and she removed the sackcloth which she had
been wearing, and took off her widow's garments, and bathed her body with
water, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and combed her hair and
put on a tiara, and arrayed herself in her gayest apparel, which she used to
wear while her husband Manasseh was living. And she put sandals on her
feet, and put on her anklets and bracelets and rings, and her earrings and all
her ornaments, and made herself very beautiful, to entice the eyes of all men
who might see her....... The women went straight on through the valley; and
an Assyrian patrol met her and took her into custody, and asked her, "To what
people do you belong, and where are you going?" She replied, "I am a
daughter of the Hebrews, but I am fleeing from them, for they are about to be
handed over to you to be devoured. I am on my way to the presence of
Holofernes the commander of your army, to give him a true report; and I will
show him a way by which he can go and capture all the hill country without
losing one of his men, captured or slain." When the man heard her words,
and observed her face--she was in their eyes marvelously beautiful--they said
to her "...Go at once to his tent.... And when you stand before him, do not be
afraid in your heart, but tell him just what you have said, and he will treat
you well."...Her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and they
marveled at her wisdom and said, "There is no such a woman from one end of
the earth to the other, either for beauty of face or wisdom of speech!"...On the
fourth day Holofernes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite
any of his officers. And he said to Bagoas, the eunuch who had charge of all
his personal affairs, "Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in
your care to join us and eat and drink with us."...So Bagoas went out from the
presence of Holofernes, and approached her...And Judith said, "Who am I, to
refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a
joy to me until the day of my death!" So she got up and arrayed herself in all
her woman's finery. Then Judith came in and lay down, and olofernes' heart
was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for
he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he
first saw her. So Holofernes said to her, "Drink now, and be merry with us!"
Judith said, "I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me
today than in all the days since I was born."...And Holofernes was greatly
pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had
ever drunk in any one day since he was born. When evening came, his slaves
quickly withdrew, and Bagoas closed the tent from outside and shut out the
attendants from his master's presence; and they went to bed.... So Judith was
left alone in the tent, with Holofernes stretched out on his bed, for he was
overcome with wine.... [Judith] went to the post at the end of the bed, above
Holofernes' head, and took down his sword that hung there. She
