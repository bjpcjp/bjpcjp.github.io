DEFEAT THEM IN DETAIL
THE DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER STRATEGY
When you look at your enemies, do not be intimidated by their appearance.
Instead look at the parts that make up the whole. By separating the parts, sowing
dissension and division from within, you can weaken and bring down even the
most formidable foe. In setting up your attack, work on their minds to create
internal conflict. Look for the joints and links, the things that connect the people
in a group or connect one group to another. Division is weakness, and the joints
are the weakest part of any structure. When you are facing troubles or enemies,
turn a large problem into small, eminently defeatable parts.
There were, however, many occasions when the French were faced not by one
but by two or a whole series of enemy armies within supporting distance of
one another. Faced with such a difficult situation, Napoleon often adopted a
second system of maneuver--the "strategy of the central position." Very often
under these circumstances the French found themselves operating at a
numerical disadvantage against the combined strength of their opponents, but
could procure superior numbers against any one part of their adversaries'
forces. It was this second factor that the system was designed to exploit to the
full. "The art of generalship consists in, when actually inferior in numbers to
the enemy (overall), being superior to him on the battlefield." In brief,
Napoleon set himself the task of isolating one part of the enemy armament,
concentrating a stronger force to ensure its defeat and if possible its
destruction, and then turning with his full strength to attack the second enemy
army; that is to say, instead of a single decisive blow, he planned a series of
smaller blows against scattered adversaries and set out to destroy them in
detail. How could this be done? Once again, the sequence of the Napoleonic
attack reveals the formula. First of all the Emperor would accumulate as
much information about the forces facing him from captured newspapers,
deserters and most especially from the indications brought in by his probing
cavalry patrols. From the data thus provided, he would carefully plot the
known dispositions of his foes on the map, and then select the place where
their respective army boundaries converged. This was the "hinge" or "joint"
of the enemy's strategic dispositions, and as such was vulnerable to attack.
This point would be selected by Napoleon for his initial blitzkrieg attack,
carried out as often as not in full strength. Shielded by the cavalry screen, the
French army would perform a crash concentration and fall like a thunderbolt
on the handful of troops defending this central point. Invariably this initial
onslaught would be successful. Immediately Napoleon had massed his army
at this newly captured point, he was master of the "central position"--that is
to say, he had successfully interposed his concentrated army between the
forces of his enemies who, ideally, would have staggered back under the
impact of the surprise blow in such a way as to increase the distance between
their respective armies. This would inevitably mean that the foe would have
to operate on "exterior lines" (i.e., have greater distances to march from one
flank to the other) while the better-positioned French would have a shorter
distance to travel to reach either enemy.
THE CAMPAIGNS OF NAPOLEON, DAVID G. CHANDLER, 1966
THE CENTRAL POSITION
One day in early August of 490 B.C., the citizens of Athens received word that a
massive Persian fleet had just landed some twenty-four miles to the north, along
the coastal plains of Marathon. A mood of doom quickly spread. Every Athenian
knew Persia's intentions--to capture their city; destroy its young democracy and
restore a former tyrant, Hippias, to the throne; and sell many of its citizens into
slavery. Some eight years earlier, Athens had sent ships to support the Greek
cities of Asia Minor in a rebellion against King Darius, ruler of the Persian
Empire. The Athenians had sailed home after a few battles--they soon saw that
this business was hopeless--but they had participated in burning down the city of
Sardis, an unforgivable outrage, and Darius wanted revenge.
The Athenians' predicament seemed desperate. The Persian army was
enormous, some 80,000 men strong, transported by hundreds of ships; it had
excellent cavalry and the best archers in the world. The Athenians, meanwhile,
had only infantry, some 10,000 strong. They had sent a runner to Sparta urgently
requesting reinforcements, but the Spartans were celebrating their moon festival
and it was taboo to fight during such a time. They would send troops as soon as
they could, within a week--but that would probably be too late. Meanwhile a
group of Persian sympathizers within Athens--mostly from wealthy families--
despised the democracy, looked forward to Hippias's return, and were doing their
best to sow dissension and betray the city from within. Not only would the
Athenians have to fight the Persians alone, but they were divided into factions
among themselves.
The leaders of democratic Athens gathered to discuss the alternatives, all of
which seemed bad. The majority argued for concentrating the Athenian forces
outside the city in a defensive cordon. There they could wait to fight the Persians
on terrain they knew well. The Persian army, however, was large enough to
surround the city by both land and sea, choking it off with a blockade. So one
leader, Miltiades, made a very different proposal: to march the entire Athenian
army immediately toward Marathon, to a place where the road to Athens passed
through a narrow pass along the coast. That would leave Athens itself
unprotected; in trying to block the Persian advance on land, it would open itself
to an attack by sea. But Miltiades argued that occupying the pass was the only
way to avoid being surrounded. He had fought the Persians in Asia Minor and
was the Athenians' most experienced soldier. The leaders voted for his plan.
And so a few days later, the 10,000 Athenian infantrymen began the march
north, slaves carrying their heavy body armor, mules and donkeys transporting
their food. When they reached the pass looking down on the plains of Marathon,
their hearts sank: as far as the eye could see, the long strip of land was filled with
tents, horses, and soldiers from all over the Persian Empire. Ships cluttered the
coast.
For several days neither side moved. The Athenians had no choice but to
hold their position; without cavalry and hopelessly outnumbered, how could they
do battle at Marathon? If enough time went by, perhaps the Spartans would
arrive as reinforcements. But what were the Persians waiting for?
Before dawn on August 12, some Greek scouts ostensibly working for the
Persians slipped across to the Athenian side and reported startling news: under
cover of darkness, the Persians had just sailed for the Bay of Phaleron outside
Athens, taking most of their cavalry with them and leaving a holding force of
some 15,000 soldiers in the plains of Marathon. They would take Athens from
the sea, then march north, squeezing the Athenian army at Marathon between
two larger forces.
Of the Athenian army's eleven commanders, Miltiades alone seemed calm,
even relieved: this was their opportunity. As the sun was getting ready to rise, he
argued for an immediate attack on the Persians at Marathon. Some of the other
commanders resisted this idea: the enemy still had more men, some cavalry, and
plenty of archers. Better to wait for the Spartans, who would surely arrive soon.
But Miltiades countered that the Persians had divided their forces. He had fought
them before and knew that the Greek infantryman was superior in discipline and
spirit. The Persians at Marathon now only slightly outnumbered the Greeks; they
could fight them and win.
Meanwhile, even with a good wind, it would take the Persian ships ten to
twelve hours to round the coast and arrive at the Bay of Phaleron. Then they
would need more time to disembark the troops and horses. If the Athenians
defeated the Persians at Marathon quickly, they would have just enough time to
run back to Athens and defend the city the same day. If instead they opted to
wait, the Spartans might never arrive; the Persians would surround them, and,
more ominously, the Persian sympathizers within Athens would probably betray
the city from within and open its walls to the barbarians. It was now or never. By
a vote of six to five, the commanders decided to attack at dawn.
At six in the morning, the Athenians began their charge. A hail of arrows
from the Persian archers rained down on them, but they closed in on the enemy
so quickly that the battle now had to be fought hand-to-hand--and, as Miltiades
had foreseen, in close combat the Athenians were superior. They pushed the
Persians back into the marshes at the north end of the plain, where thousands
drowned. The waters reddened with blood. By nine in the morning, the
Athenians had control of the plains, having lost fewer than two hundred men.
Although emotionally spent by this battle, the Athenians now had only
around seven hours to make the twenty-four miles back to Athens in time to stop
the Persians. There was simply no time to rest; they ran, as fast their feet could
take them, loaded down in their heavy armor, impelled by the thought of the
imminent dangers facing their families and fellow citizens. By four in the
afternoon, the fastest among them had straggled to a point overlooking the Bay
of Phaleron. The rest soon followed. Within a matter of minutes after their
arrival, the Persian fleet sailed into the bay to see a most unwelcome sight:
thousands of Athenian soldiers, caked in dust and blood, standing shoulder to
shoulder to fight the landing.
The Persians rode at anchor for a few hours, then headed out to sea,
returning home. Athens was saved.
Interpretation
The victory at Marathon and race to Athens were perhaps the most decisive
moments in Athenian history. Had the soldiers not come in time, the Persians
would have taken the city, then certainly all of Greece, and eventually they
would have expanded throughout the Mediterranean, for no other power in
existence at the time could have stopped them. History would have been altered
irrevocably.
Miltiades' plan worked by the narrowest of margins, but it was based on
sound and timeless principles. When a powerful foe attacks you in strength,
threatening your ability to advance and take the initiative, you must work to
make the enemy divide its forces and then defeat these smaller forces one by
one--"in detail," as the military say.
The key to Miltiades' strategy was his intuition to take the battle to
Marathon. By placing himself at the pass that led to Athens, he occupied the
central position in the war instead of the southern periphery. With the entire
army holding the pass, the Persians would have a bloody time forcing their way
through, so they decided to divide their forces before the Spartan reinforcements
arrived. Once divided, and with their cavalry diluted, they lost their advantage
and the central position from which they could dominate the war.
For the Athenians it was imperative to fight the smallest force first, the one
they faced at Marathon. That done, and having taken the central position, they
had the shorter route to Athens, while the invaders had to round the coast.
Arriving first at Phaleron, the Athenians allowed no safe place to disembark. The
Persians could have returned to Marathon, but the arrival of the bloodied
Athenian soldiers from the north must have told them they had already lost the
battle there, and their spirits were broken. Retreat was the only option.
There will be times in life when you face a powerful enemy--a destructive
opponent seeking your undoing, a slew of seemingly insurmountable problems
hitting you at once. It is natural to feel intimidated in these situations, which may
paralyze you into inaction or make you wait in the vain hope that time will bring
a solution. But it is a law of war that by allowing the larger force to come to you,
at full strength and unified, you increase the odds against you; a large and
powerful army on the move will gain an irresistible momentum if left
unchecked. You will find yourself quickly overwhelmed. The wisest course is to
take a risk, meet the enemy before it comes to you, and try to blunt its
momentum by forcing or enticing it to divide. And the best way to make an
enemy divide is to occupy the center.
Think of battle or conflict as existing on a kind of chessboard. The
chessboard's center can be physical--an actual place like Marathon--or more
subtle and psychological: the levers of power within a group, the support of a
critical ally, a troublemaker at the eye of the storm. Take the center of the
chessboard and the enemy will naturally break into parts, trying to hit you from
more than one side. These smaller parts are now manageable, can be defeated in
detail or forced to divide yet again. And once something large is divided, it is
prone to further division, to being splintered into nothingness.
As your army faces the enemy and the enemy appears powerful, try to attack
the enemy in one particular spot. If you are successful in crumbling that one
particular spot, leave that spot and attack the next, and so on and so forth, as
if you were going down a winding road.
--Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645)
ATTACKING THE JOINTS
As a young man, Samuel Adams (1722-1803) of colonial-era Boston developed
a dream: the American colonies, he believed, should one day win complete
independence from England and establish a government based on the writings of
the English philosopher John Locke. According to Locke, a government should
reflect the will of its citizens; a government that did not do so had lost its right to
exist. Adams had inherited a brewery from his father, but he did not care about
business, and while the brewery veered toward bankruptcy, he spent his time
writing articles on Locke and the need for independence. He was an excellent
writer, good enough to get his articles published, but few took his ideas
seriously: he seemed to rant, to be somewhat out of touch with the world. He had
that obsessive glint in the eye that makes people think you're a crackpot. The
problem was that the ties between England and America were strong; the
colonists did have their grievances, but there was hardly a clamor for
independence. Adams began to have bouts of depression; his self-appointed
mission seemed hopeless.
The British desperately needed money from the colonies, and in 1765 they
passed a law called the Stamp Act: to make any document legal, American
businesses would be required to purchase and affix to it a stamp of the British
crown. The colonists were growing ticklish about the taxes they paid to England;
they saw the Stamp Act as a new kind of tax in disguise, and a few disgruntled
voices were raised in urban taverns. Even so, for most the issue seemed minor--
but Adams saw the Stamp Act as the opportunity he had been waiting for his
whole life. It gave him something tangible to attack, and he flooded newspapers
throughout the colonies with editorials, all fulminating against the act. Without
consulting the colonies, he wrote, England was imposing a new kind of tax, and
this, in a memorable phrase, was taxation without representation, the first step
toward tyranny.
A novice chess player soon learns that it is a good idea to control the center
of the board. This recognition will recur, in novel disguises, in situations far
from the chessboard. It may help to seek the equivalent of the center of the
board in any situation, or to see that the role of the center has migrated to the
flanks, or to realize that there is no board and no singular topology....

OETINGER, CHRISTOPHER BASSFORD, EDS., 2001
These editorials were so well written and so audacious in their criticisms that
many began to take a closer look at the Stamp Act, and they did not like what
they saw. Adams had never previously gone beyond writing articles, but now
that he had lit this fire of discontent, he saw the urgency in stoking it further with
action. For many years he had fraternized with working-class people considered
riffraff by polite society--dockworkers and the like; now he banded these men
into an organization called the Sons of Liberty. The group marched through the
streets of Boston shouting a slogan Adams had coined: "Liberty, property, and no
stamps!" They burned effigies of political figures who had promoted the Stamp
Act. They distributed pamphlets containing Adams's arguments against the act.
They also worked to intimidate the future distributors of the stamps, even going
so far as to destroy one of their offices. The more dramatic the action, the more
publicity Adams would earn, publicity into which he could insert arguments
against the act.
Having gained momentum, the relentless Adams would not stop. He
organized a statewide work stoppage for the day the act was to become law:
shops would close, the courts would be empty. Since no business would be
conducted in Massachusetts, no stamps would be purchased. The boycott was
massively successful.
Adams's articles, demonstrations, and boycott made a splash in England, and
there were members of Parliament who sympathized with the colonists and
spoke out against the Stamp Act. Finally King George III had had enough, and in
April 1766 the act was repealed. Americans rejoiced at their first show of power.
The British were smarting from their defeat, however, and the following year
they sneaked in another series of indirect taxes known as the Townshend System.
Clearly they had underestimated their enemy: Adams went to war. As he had
with the Stamp Act, he wrote countless articles on the nature of the taxes the
English had tried to disguise, once again stirring up anger. He also organized
further demonstrations by the Sons of Liberty, now more menacing and violent
than ever--in fact, the English were forced to send troops to Boston to keep the
peace. This had been Adams's goal all along; he had ratcheted up the tension.
Belligerent encounters between the Sons of Liberty and the English troops put
the soldiers on edge, and finally a nervous group of them fired into a crowd,
killing several Bostonians. Adams called this the Boston Massacre and spread
fiery word of it throughout the colonies.
With the people of Boston now bubbling with anger, Adams organized
another boycott: no citizen of Massachusetts, not even a prostitute, would sell
anything to British soldiers. No one would rent them lodgings. They were
shunned in the streets and taverns; even eye contact was avoided. All of this had
a demoralizing effect on the British soldiers. Feeling isolated and antagonized,
many of them began to desert or find ways to be sent home.
Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household
falls. And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom
stand?
LUKE 11:14
News of the problems in Massachusetts spread north and south; colonists
everywhere began to talk about Britain's actions in Boston, its use of force, its
hidden taxes, its patronizing attitude. Then, in 1773, Parliament passed the Tea
Act, on the surface a rather harmless attempt to solve the economic problems of
the East India Company by giving it a virtual monopoly on the sale of tea in the
colonies. The law also levied a nominal tax, but, even so, it would have made tea
cheaper in the colonies, because the middlemen--the colonial importers--were to
be cut out. The Tea Act, however, was deceptive in its effect, and confusing, and
Adams saw in it a chance to apply the coup de grace: it would ruin many
colonial tea importers, and it did include a hidden tax, yet another form of
taxation without representation. In exchange for cheaper tea, the English were
making a mockery of
