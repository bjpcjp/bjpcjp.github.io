SEGMENT YOUR FORCES
THE CONTROLLED-CHAOS STRATEGY
The critical elements in war are speed and adaptability--the ability to move and
make decisions faster than the enemy. But speed and adaptability are hard to
achieve today. We have more information than ever before at our fingertips,
making interpretation and decision making more difficult. We have more people
to manage, those people are more widely spread, and we face more uncertainty.
Learn from Napoleon, warfare's greatest master: speed and adaptability come
from flexible organization. Break your forces into independent groups that can
operate and make decisions on their own. Make your forces elusive and
unstoppable by infusing them with the spirit of the campaign, giving them a
mission to accomplish, and then letting them run.
Finally, a most important point to be considered is that the revolutionary
system of command employed by Napoleon was the outcome not of any
technological advances, as one might expect, but merely of superior
organization and doctrine. The technical means at the emperor's disposal
were not a whit more sophisticated than those of his opponents; he differed
from them in that he possessed the daring and ingenuity needed to transcend
the limits that technology had imposed on commanders for thousands of
years. Whereas Napoleon's opponents sought to maintain control and
minimize uncertainty by keeping their forces closely concentrated, Napoleon
chose the opposite way, reorganizing and decentralizing his army in such a
way as to enable its parts to operate independently for a limited period of
time and consequently tolerate a higher degree of uncertainty. Rather than
allowing the technological means at hand to dictate the method of strategy
and the functioning of command, Napoleon made profitable use of the very
limitations imposed by the technology.
COMMAND IN WAR, MARTIN VAN CREVELD, 1985
CALCULATED DISORDER
In 1800, by defeating Austria in the Battle of Marengo, Napoleon gained control
of northern Italy and forced the Austrians to sign a treaty recognizing French
territorial gains there and in Belgium. For the next five years, an uneasy peace
held sway--but Napoleon crowned himself emperor of France, and many in
Europe began to suspect that this Corsican upstart had limitless ambitions. Karl
Mack, the Austrian quartermaster general and an older and influential member of
the Austrian military, advocated a preemptive strike against France, with an
army large enough to guarantee victory. He told his colleagues, "In war the
object is to beat the enemy, not merely to avoid being beaten."
Mack and like-minded officers slowly gained influence, and in April 1805,
Austria, England, and Russia signed a treaty of alliance to wage war on France
and force her to return to her pre-Napoleonic borders. That summer they
formulated their plan: 95,000 Austrian troops would attack the French in
northern Italy, redressing the humiliating defeat of 1800. Another 23,000 troops
would secure the Tyrol, between Italy and Austria. Mack would then lead a force
of 70,000 men west along the Danube into Bavaria, preventing this strategically
located country from allying itself with France. Once encamped in Bavaria,
Mack and his army would await the arrival a few weeks later of 75,000 troops
from Russia; the two armies would link up, and this unstoppable force would
march west into France. Meanwhile the English would attack the French at sea.
More troops would later be funneled into each war zone, making for an army
totaling 500,000 men overall--the largest military force ever assembled in
Europe up to that point. Not even Napoleon could withstand an army more than
twice the size of his own, moving in on him from all sides.
In the middle of September, Mack began his phase of the campaign by
advancing along the Danube to Ulm, in the heart of Bavaria. Having established
his camp there, he felt hugely satisfied. Mack loathed disorder and uncertainty.
He tried to think of everything in advance, to come up with a clear plan and
make sure everyone stuck to it--"clockwork warfare," he called it. He thought his
plan was perfect; nothing could go wrong. Napoleon was doomed.
Mack had once been captured and forced to spend three years in France,
where he had studied Napoleon's style of war. A key Napoleonic strategy was to
make the enemy divide his forces, but now the trick was reversed: with trouble
in Italy, Napoleon could not afford to send more than 70,000 French troops
across the Rhine into Germany and Bavaria. The moment he crossed the Rhine,
the Austrians would know his intentions and would act to slow his march; his
army would need at least two months to reach Ulm and the Danube. By then the
Austrians would already have linked up with the Russians and swept through the
Alsace and France. The strategy was as close to foolproof as any Mack had ever
known. He savored the role he would play in destroying Napoleon, for he hated
the man and all he represented--undisciplined soldiers, the fomenting of
revolution throughout Europe, the constant threat to the status quo. For Mack the
Russians could not arrive in Ulm too soon.
We find our attention drawn repeatedly to what one might call "the
organizational dimension of strategy." Military organizations, and the states
that develop them, periodically assess their own ability to handle military
threats. When they do so they tend to look at that which can be quantified: the
number of troops, the quantities of ammunition, the readiness rates of key
equipment, the amount of transport, and so on. Rarely, however, do they look
at the adequacy of their organization as such, and particularly high level
organization, to handle these challenges. Yet as Pearl Harbor and other cases
suggest, it is in the deficiency of organizations that the embryo of misfortune
develops.

A. COHEN AND JOHN GOOCH, 1990
Near the end of September, however, Mack began to sense something
wrong. To the west of Ulm lay the Black Forest, between his own position and
the French border. Suddenly scouts were telling him that a French army was
passing through the forest in his direction. Mack was bewildered: it made the
best sense for Napoleon to cross the Rhine into Germany farther to the north,
where his passage east would be smoother and harder to stop. But now he was
yet again doing the unexpected, funneling an army through a narrow opening in
the Black Forest and sending it straight at Mack. Even if this move were just a
feint, Mack had to defend his position, so he sent part of his army west into the
Black Forest to stem the French advance long enough for the Russians to come
to his aid.
A few days later, Mack began to feel horribly confused. The French were
proceeding through the Black Forest, and some of their cavalry had come quite
far. At the same time, though, word reached Mack of a large French army
somewhere to the north of his position. The reports were contradictory: some
said this army was at Stuttgart, sixty miles northwest of Ulm; others had it more
to the east or even farther to the north or--quite close, near the Danube. Mack
could get no hard information, since the French cavalry that had come through
the Black Forest blocked access to the north for reconnaissance. The Austrian
general now faced what he feared most--uncertainty--and it was clouding his
ability to think straight. Finally he ordered all of his troops back to Ulm, where
he would concentrate his forces. Perhaps Napoleon intended to do battle at Ulm.
At least Mack would have equal numbers.
In early October, Austrian scouts were at last able to find out what was really
going on, and it was a nightmare. A French army had crossed the Danube to the
east of Ulm, blocking Mack's way back to Austria and cutting off the Russians.
Another army lay to the south, blocking his route to Italy. How could 70,000
French soldiers appear in so many places at once? And move so fast? Gripped by
panic, Mack sent probes in every direction. On October 11 his men discovered a
weak point: only a small French force barred the way north and east. There he
could push through and escape the French encirclement. He began to prepare for
the march. But two days later, when he was on the point of ordering the retreat,
his scouts reported that a large French force had appeared overnight, blocking
the northeastern route as well.
On October 20, finding out that the Russians had decided not to come to his
rescue, Mack surrendered. Over 60,000 Austrian soldiers were taken prisoner
with hardly a shot fired. It was one of the most splendidly bloodless victories in
history.
In the next few months, Napoleon's army turned east to deal with the
Russians and remaining Austrians, culminating in his spectacular victory at
Austerlitz. Meanwhile Mack languished in an Austrian prison, sentenced to two
years for his role in this humiliating defeat. There he racked his brains (losing
his sanity in the process, some said): Where had his plan gone wrong? How had
an army appeared out of nowhere to his east, so easily swallowing him up? He
had never seen anything like it, and he was trying to figure it out to the end of
his days.
The fact that, historically speaking, those armies have been most successful
which did not turn their troops into automatons, did not attempt to control
everything from the top, and allowed subordinate commanders considerable
latitude has been abundantly demonstrated. The Roman centurions and
military tribunes; Napoleon's marshals; Moltke's army commanders;
Ludendorff's storm detachments...--all these are examples, each within its
own stage of technological development, of the way things were done in some
of the most successful military forces ever.
COMMAND IN WAR, MARTIN VAN CREVELD, 1985
Interpretation History should not judge General Mack too harshly, for the
French armies he faced in the fall of 1805 represented one of the greatest
revolutions in military history. For thousands of years, war had been fought in
essentially the same way: the commander led his large and unified army into
battle against an opponent of roughly equal size. He would never break up his
army into smaller units, for that would violate the military principle of keeping
one's forces concentrated; furthermore, scattering his forces would make them
harder to monitor, and he would lose control over the battle.
Suddenly Napoleon changed all that. In the years of peace between 1800 and
1805, he reorganized the French military, bringing different forces together to
form the Grande Armee, 210,000 men strong. He divided this army into several
corps, each with its own cavalry, infantry, artillery, and general staff. Each was
led by a marshal general, usually a young officer of proven strength in previous
campaigns. Varying in size from 15,000 to 30,000 men, each corps was a
miniature army headed by a miniature Napoleon.
Patton's philosophy of command was: "Never tell people how to do things.
Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity."
PATTON: A GENIUS FOR WAR, CARLO D'ESTE, 1995
The key to the system was the speed with which the corps could move.
Napoleon would give the marshals their mission, then let them accomplish it on
their own. Little time was wasted with the passing of orders back and forth, and
smaller armies, needing less baggage, could march with greater speed. Instead of
a single army moving in a straight line, Napoleon could disperse and concentrate
his corps in limitless patterns, which to the enemy seemed chaotic and
unreadable.
This was the monster that Napoleon unleashed on Europe in September
1805. While a few corps were dispatched to northern Italy as a holding force
against Austria's planned invasion there, seven corps moved east into Germany
in a scattered array. A reserve force with much cavalry was sent through the
Black Forest, drawing Mack to the west--and so making it harder for him to
understand what was happening to the north and easier to entrap. (Napoleon
understood Mack's simple psychology and how the appearance of disorder
would paralyze him.) Meanwhile, with Stuttgart as a pivot, the seven corps
wheeled south to the Danube and cut off Mack's various escape routes. One
corps marshal, hearing that the northeastern route was weakly held, did not wait
for Napoleon to send orders but simply sped and covered it on his own.
Wherever Mack went, he would hit a corps large enough to hold him until the
rest of the French army could tighten the circle. It was like a pack of coyotes
against a rabbit.
Agamemnon smiled and moved on, Coming next to the two captains Who
shared the name Ajax As they were strapping on their helmets. Behind them a
cloud of infantry loomed...Agamemnon Was glad to see them, and his words
flew out: "Ajax, both of you, Achaean commanders, I would be out of line if I
issued you orders. You push your men to fight hard on your own. By Father
Zeus, by Athena and Apollo, If all of my men had your kind of heart, King
Priam's city would soon bow her head, Taken and ravaged under our hands."
 
THE ILIAD, HOMER, CIRCA NINTH CENTURY B.C.
Understand: the future belongs to groups that are fluid, fast, and nonlinear.
Your natural tendency as a leader may be to want to control the group, to
coordinate its every movement, but that will just tie you to the past and to the
slow-moving armies of history. It takes strength of character to allow for a
margin of chaos and uncertainty--to let go a little--but by decentralizing your
army and segmenting it into teams, you will gain in mobility what you lose in
complete control. And mobility is the greatest force multiplier of them all. It
allows you to both disperse and concentrate your army, throwing it into patterns
instead of advancing in straight lines. These patterns will confuse and paralyze
your opponents. Give your different corps clear missions that fit your strategic
goals, then let them accomplish them as they see fit. Smaller teams are faster,
more creative, more adaptable; their officers and soldiers are more engaged,
more motivated. In the end, fluidity will bring you far more power and control
than petty domination.
Separate to live, unite to fight.
--Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)
KEYS TO WARFARE
The world is full of people looking for a secret formula for success and power.
They do not want to think on their own; they just want a recipe to follow. They
are attracted to the idea of strategy for that very reason. In their minds strategy is
a series of steps to be followed toward a goal. They want these steps spelled out
for them by an expert or a guru. Believing in the power of imitation, they want to
know exactly what some great person has done before. Their maneuvers in life
are as mechanical as their thinking.
To separate yourself from such a crowd, you need to get rid of a common
misconception: the essence of strategy is not to carry out a brilliant plan that
proceeds in steps; it is to put yourself in situations where you have more options
than the enemy does. Instead of grasping at Option A as the single right answer,
true strategy is positioning yourself to be able to do A, B, or C depending on the
circumstances. That is strategic depth of thinking, as opposed to formulaic
thinking.
Sun-tzu expressed this idea differently: what you aim for in strategy, he said,
is shih, a position of potential force--the position of a boulder perched
precariously on a hilltop, say, or of a bowstring stretched taut. A tap on the
boulder, the release of the bowstring, and potential force is violently unleashed.
The boulder or arrow can go in any direction; it is geared to the actions of the
enemy. What matters is not following pre-ordained steps but placing yourself in
shih and giving yourself options.
Napoleon was probably unaware of Sun-tzu's concept of shih, yet he had
perhaps history's greatest understanding of it. Once he had positioned his seven
corps in their seemingly chaotic pattern along the Rhine and his reserve forces in
the Black Forest, he was in shih. Wherever Mack turned, whatever he did, the
Austrians were doomed. Napoleon had endless options while Mack had only a
few, and all of them bad.
It was during this period of post-war introspection and evaluation that one of
the fundamental military concepts of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau coalesced
into a clearly defined doctrine understandable to and understood by all
officers in the Army. This was the concept of Auftragstaktik , or mission
tactics. Moltke himself inserted in the draft of a new tactical manual for
senior commanders the following lines: "A favorable situation will never be
exploited if commanders wait for orders. The highest commander and the
youngest soldier must always be conscious of the fact that omission and
inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong expedient."...Nothing
epitomized the outlook and performance of the German General Staff, and of
the German Army which it coordinated, more than this concept of mission
tactics: the responsibility of each German officer and noncommissioned
officer...to do without question or doubt whatever the situation required, as he
saw it. This meant that he should act without awaiting orders, if action
seemed necessary. It also meant that he should act contrary to orders, if these
did not seem to be consistent with the situation. To make perfectly clear that
action contrary to orders was not considered either as disobedience or lack of
discipline, German commanders began to repeat one of Moltke's favorite
stories, of an incident observed while visiting the headquarters of Prince
Frederick Charles. A major, receiving a tongue-lashing from the Prince for a
tactical blunder, offered the excuse that he had been obeying orders, and
reminded the Prince that a Prussian officer was taught that an order from a
superior was tantamount to an order from the King. Frederick Charles
promptly responded: "His Majesty made you a major because he believed you
would know when not to obey his orders." This simple story became guidance
for all following generations of German officers.
A GENIUS FOR WAR: THE GERMAN ARMY AND GENERAL STAFF, 1807-
1945, COLONEL T.N. DUPUY, 1977
Napoleon had always aimed at his version of shih, and he perfected it in the
1805 campaign. Obsessed with structure and organization, he developed the
corps system, building flexibility into the very skeleton of his army. The lesson
is simple: a rigid, centralized organization locks you into linear strategies; a
fluid, segmented army gives you options, endless possibilities for reaching shih.
Structure is strategy--perhaps the most important strategic choice you will make.
Should you inherit a group, analyze its structure and alter it to suit your
purposes. Pour your creative energy into its organization, making fluidity your
goal. In doing so you will be following in the footsteps not only of Napoleon but
of perhaps the greatest war machine in modern times, the Prussian (and later
German) army.
Shortly after Napoleon's devastating defeat of the Prussians at the Battle of
Jena in 1806 (see chapter 2), the Prussian leaders did some soul-searching. They
saw they were stuck in the past; their way of doing things was too rigid.
Suddenly the military reformers, including Carl von Clausewitz, were taken
seriously and given power. And what they decided to do was unprecedented in
history: they would institutionalize success by designing a superior army
structure.
At the core of this revolution was the creation of a general staff, a cadre of
officers specially trained and educated in strategy, tactics, and leadership. A
king, a prime minister, or even a general might be incompetent at war, but a
group of brilliant and well-trained officers on the army's staff could compensate
for his failures. The structure of this body was unfixed: each new chief of staff
could alter its size and function to suit his needs and the times. After each
campaign o
