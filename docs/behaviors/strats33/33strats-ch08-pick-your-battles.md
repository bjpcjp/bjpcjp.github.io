PICK YOUR BATTLES CAREFULLY
THE PERFECT-ECONOMY STRATEGY
We all have limitations--our energies and skills will take us only so far. Danger
comes from trying to surpass our limits. Seduced by some glittering prize into
overextending ourselves, we end up exhausted and vulnerable. You must know
your limits and pick your battles carefully. Consider the hidden costs of a war:
time lost, political goodwill squandered, an embittered enemy bent on revenge.
Sometimes it is better to wait, to undermine your enemies covertly rather than
hitting them straight on. If battle cannot be avoided, get them to fight on your
terms. Aim at their weaknesses; make the war expensive for them and cheap for
you. Fighting with perfect economy, you can outlast even the most powerful foe.
THE SPIRAL EFFECT
In 281 B.C. war broke out between Rome and the city of Tarentum, on Italy's
east coast. Tarentum had begun as a colony of the Greek city of Sparta; its
citizens still spoke Greek, considered themselves cultured Spartans, and thought
other Italian cities barbaric. Rome meanwhile was an emerging power, locked in
a series of wars with neighboring cities.
In the utilization of a theater of war, as in everything else, strategy calls for
economy of strength. The less one can manage with, the better; but manage
one must, and here, as in commerce, there is more to it than mere stinginess.
CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
The prudent Romans were reluctant to take on Tarentum. It was Italy's
wealthiest city at the time, rich enough to finance its allies in a war against
Rome; it was also too far away, off in the southeast, to pose an immediate threat.
But the Tarentines had sunk some Roman ships that had wandered into their
harbor, killing the fleet's admiral, and when Rome had tried to negotiate a
settlement, its ambassadors had been insulted. Roman honor was at stake, and it
readied itself for war.
Tarentum had a problem: it was wealthy but had no real army. Its citizens
had gotten used to easy living. The solution was to call in a Greek army to fight
on its behalf. The Spartans were otherwise occupied, so the Tarentines called on
King Pyrrhus of Epirus (319-272 B.C.), the greatest Greek warrior king since
Alexander the Great.
Epirus was a small kingdom in west-central Greece. It was a poor land,
sparsely populated, with meager resources, but Pyrrhus--raised on stories of
Achilles, from whom his family claimed to be descended, and of Alexander the
Great, a distant cousin--was determined to follow in the footsteps of his
illustrious ancestors and relatives, expanding Epirus and carving out his own
empire. As a young man, he had served in the armies of other great military men,
including Ptolemy, a general of Alexander's who now ruled Egypt. Pyrrhus had
quickly proved his value as a warrior and leader. In battle he had become known
for leading dangerous charges, earning himself the nickname "The Eagle." Back
in Epirus he had built up his small army and trained it well, even managing to
defeat the much larger Macedonian army in several battles.
Pyrrhus's reputation was on the rise, but it was hard for a small country like
his to gain ascendancy over more powerful Greek neighbors like the
Macedonians, the Spartans, and the Athenians. And the Tarentines' offer was
tempting: First, they promised him money and a large army raised from allied
states. Second, by defeating the Romans, he could make himself master of Italy,
and from Italy he could take first Sicily, then Carthage in North Africa.
Alexander had moved east to create his empire; Pyrrhus could move west and
dominate the Mediterranean. He accepted the offer.
In the spring of 280 B.C., Pyrrhus set sail with the largest Greek army ever
to cross into Italy: 20,000 foot soldiers, 3,000 horsemen, 2,000 bowmen, and
twenty elephants. Once in Tarentum, though, he realized he had been tricked: not
only did the Tarentines have no army, they had made no effort to assemble one,
leaving Pyrrhus to do it himself. Pyrrhus wasted no time: he declared a military
dictatorship in the city and began to build and train an army from among the
Tarentines as fast as possible.
Pyrrhus's arrival in Tarentum worried the Romans, who knew his reputation
as a strategist and fighter. Deciding to give him no time to prepare, they quickly
sent out an army, forcing Pyrrhus to make do with what he had and he set off to
face them. The two armies met near the town of Heraclea. Pyrrhus and his troops
were outnumbered and at one point were on the verge of defeat, when he
unleashed his secret weapon: his elephants, with their massive weight, loud,
fearsome trumpeting, and soldiers on top, firing arrows down at will. The
Romans had never faced elephants in battle before, and panic spread among
them, turning the tide of the fight. Soon the disciplined Roman legions were in
headlong retreat.
"The Eagle" had won a great victory. His fame spread across the Italian
peninsula; he was indeed the reincarnation of Alexander the Great. Now other
cities sent him reinforcements, more than making up for his losses at Heraclea.
But Pyrrhus was worried. He had lost many veterans in the battle, including key
generals. More important, the strength and discipline of the Roman legions had
impressed him--they were like no other troops he had faced. He decided to try to
negotiate a peaceful settlement with the Romans, offering to share the peninsula
with them. At the same time, though, he marched on Rome, to give the
negotiations urgency and to make it clear that unless the Romans sued for peace,
they would face him again.
Meanwhile the defeat at Heraclea had had a powerful effect on the Romans,
who were not easily intimidated and did not take defeat lightly. Immediately
after the battle, a call went out for recruits, and young men responded in droves.
The Romans proudly rejected the offer of a settlement; they would never share
Italy.
The two armies met again near the town of Asculum, not far from Rome, in
the spring of 279 B.C. This time their numbers were about equal. The first day of
battle was fierce, and once again the Romans seemed to have the edge, but on
the second day Pyrrhus, a strategic master, managed to lure the Roman legions
onto terrain better suited to his own style of maneuvering, and he gained the
advantage. As was his wont, near the end of the day he personally led a violent
charge at the heart of the Roman legions, elephants in front. The Romans
scattered, and Pyrrhus was once again victorious.
King Pyrrhus had now scaled the heights, yet he felt only gloom and
foreboding. His losses had been terrible; the ranks of the generals he depended
on were decimated, and he himself had been badly wounded. At the same time,
the Romans seemed inexhaustible, undaunted by their defeat. When
congratulated on his victory at Asculum, he replied, "If we defeat the Romans in
one more such battle, we shall be totally ruined."
Pyrrhus, however, was already ruined. His losses at Asculum were too large
to be quickly replaced, and his remaining forces were too few to fight the
Romans again. His Italian campaign was over.
Interpretation
From the story of King Pyrrhus and his famous lament after the Battle of
Asculum comes the expression "Pyrrhic victory," signifying a triumph that is as
good as a defeat, for it comes at too great a cost. The victor is too exhausted to
exploit his win, too vulnerable to face the next battle. And indeed, after the
"victory" at Asculum, Pyrrhus staggered from one disaster to the next, his army
never quite strong enough to defeat his growing hosts of enemies. This
culminated in his untimely death in battle, ending Epirus's hopes to become a
power in Greece.
Pyrrhus could have avoided this downward spiral. Advance intelligence
would have told him about both the disciplined ferocity of the Romans and the
decadence and treachery of the Tarentines, and, knowing this, he could have
taken more time to build an army or canceled the expedition altogether. Once he
saw that he had been tricked, he could have turned back; after Heraclea there
was still time to retrench, consolidate, quit while he was ahead. Had he done any
of this, his story might have had a different ending. But Pyrrhus could not stop
himself--the dream was too alluring. Why worry about the costs? He could
recover later. One more battle, one more victory, would seal the deal.
Pyrrhic victories are much more common than you might think. Excitement
about a venture's prospects is natural before it begins, and if the goal is enticing,
we unconsciously see what we want to see--more of the possible gains, fewer of
the possible difficulties. The further we go, the harder it becomes to pull back
and rationally reassess the situation. In such circumstances the costs tend not just
to mount--they spiral out of control. If things go badly, we get exhausted, which
leads us to make mistakes, which lead to new, unforeseen problems, which in
turn lead to new costs. Any victories we might have along the way are
meaningless.
Understand: the more you want the prize, the more you must compensate by
examining what getting it will take. Look beyond the obvious costs and think
about the intangible ones: the goodwill you may squander by waging war, the
fury of the loser if you win, the time that winning may take, your debt to your
allies. You can always wait for a better time; you can always try something more
in line with your resources. Remember: history is littered with the corpses of
people who ignored the costs. Save yourself unnecessary battles and live to fight
another day.
When the weapons have grown dull and spirits depressed, when our strength
has been expended and resources consumed, then others will take advantage
of our exhaustion to arise. Then even if you have wise generals you cannot
make things turn out well in the end.
--The Art of War, Sun-tzu (fourth century B.C.)
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
When Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) ascended the throne of England in 1558,
she inherited a second-rate power: the country had been racked by civil war, and
its finances were in a mess. Elizabeth dreamed of creating a long period of peace
in which she could slowly rebuild England's foundations and particularly its
economy: a government with money was a government with options. England, a
small island with limited resources, could not hope to compete in war with
France and Spain, the great powers of Europe. Instead it would gain strength
through trade and economic stability.
He whom the ancients called an expert in battle gained victory where victory
was easily gained. Thus the battle of the expert is never an exceptional
victory, nor does it win him reputation for wisdom or credit for courage. His
victories in battle are unerring. Unerring means that he acts where victory is
certain, and conquers an enemy that has already lost.
 
THE ART OF WAR, SUN-TZU, FOURTH CENTURY B.C.
Year by year for twenty years, Elizabeth made progress. Then, in the late
1570s, her situation suddenly seemed dire: an imminent war with Spain
threatened to cancel all the gains of the previous two decades. The Spanish king,
Philip II, was a devout Catholic who considered it his personal mission to
reverse the spread of Protestantism. The Low Countries (now Holland and
Belgium) were properties of Spain at the time, but a growing Protestant rebellion
was threatening its rule, and Philip went to war with the rebels, determined to
crush them. Meanwhile his most cherished dream was to restore Catholicism to
England. His short-term strategy was a plot to have Elizabeth assassinated and
then to place her half sister, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, on the British
throne. In case this plan failed, his long-term strategy was to build an immense
armada of ships and invade England.
Philip did not keep his intentions well hidden, and Elizabeth's ministers saw
war as inevitable. They advised her to send an army to the Low Countries,
forcing Philip to put his resources there instead of into an attack on England--but
Elizabeth balked at that idea; she would send small forces there to help the
Protestant rebels avert a military disaster, but she would not commit to anything
more. Elizabeth dreaded war; maintaining an army was a huge expense, and all
sorts of other hidden costs were sure to emerge, threatening the stability she had
built up. If war with Spain really was inevitable, Elizabeth wanted to fight on her
own terms; she wanted a war that would ruin Spain financially and leave
England safe.
Defying her ministers, Elizabeth did what she could to keep the peace with
Spain, refusing to provoke Philip. That bought her time to put aside funds for
building up the British navy. Meanwhile she worked in secret to damage the
Spanish economy, which she saw as its only weak spot. Spain's enormous,
expanding empire in the New World made it powerful, but that empire was far
away. To maintain it and profit from it, Philip was entirely dependent on
shipping, a vast fleet that he paid for with enormous loans from Italian bankers.
His credit with these banks depended on the safe passage of his ships bringing
gold from the New World. The power of Spain rested on a weak foundation.
And so Queen Elizabeth unleashed her greatest captain, Sir Francis Drake,
on the Spanish treasure ships. He was to appear to be operating on his own, a
pirate out for his own profit. No one was to know of the connection between him
and the queen. With each ship that he captured, the interest rate on Philip's loans
crept upward, until eventually the Italian bankers were raising the rate more
because of the threat of Drake than because of any specific loss. Philip had
hoped to launch his armada against England by 1582; short of money, he had to
delay. Elizabeth had bought herself more time.
Meanwhile, much to the chagrin of Philip's finance ministers, the king
refused to scale back the size of the invading armada. Building it might take
longer, but he would just borrow more money. Seeing his fight with England as a
religious crusade, he would not be deterred by mere matters of finance.
Achilles now routed the Trojans and pursued them towards the city, but his
course, too, was run. Poseidon and Apollo, pledged to avenge the deaths of
Cycnus and Troilus, and to punish certain insolent boasts that Achilles had
uttered over Hector's corpse, took counsel together. Veiled with cloud and
standing by the Scaean gate, Apollo sought out Paris in the thick of battle,
turned his bow and guided the fatal shaft. It struck the one vulnerable part of
Achilles's body, the right heel, and he died in agony.
THE GREEK MYTHS, VOL. 2, ROBERT GRAVES, 1955
While working to ruin Philip's credit, Elizabeth put an important part of her
meager resources into building up England's spy network--in fact, she made it
the most sophisticated intelligence agency in Europe. With agents throughout
Spain, she was kept informed of Philip's every move. She knew exactly how
large the armada was to be and when it was to be launched. That allowed her to
postpone calling up her army and reserves until the very last moment, saving the
government money.
Finally, in the summer of 1588, the Spanish Armada was ready. It comprised
128 ships, including twenty large galleons, and a vast number of sailors and
soldiers. Equal in size to England's entire navy, it had cost a fortune. The
Armada set sail from Lisbon in the second week of July. But Elizabeth's spies
had fully informed her of Spain's plans, and she was able to send a fleet of
smaller, more mobile English ships to harass the Armada on its way up the
French coast, sinking its supply ships and generally creating chaos. As the
commander of the English fleet, Lord Howard of Effingham, reported, "Their
force is wonderful great and strong; and yet we pluck their feathers little by
little."
Finally the Armada came to anchor in the port of Calais, where it was to link
up with the Spanish armies stationed in the Low Countries. Determined to
prevent it from picking up these reinforcements, the English gathered eight large
ships, loaded them with flammable substances, and set them on course for the
Spanish fleet, which was anchored in tight formation. As the British ships
approached the harbor under full sail, their crews set them on fire and evacuated.
The result was havoc, with dozens of Spanish ships in flames. Others scrambled
for safe water, often colliding with one another. In their haste to put to sea, all
order broke down.
The loss of ships and supplies at Calais devastated Spanish discipline and
morale, and the invasion was called off. To avoid further attacks on the return to
Spain, the remaining ships headed not south but north, planning to sail home
around Scotland and Ireland. The English did not even bother with pursuit; they
knew that the rough weather in those waters would do the damage for them. By
the time the shattered Armada returned to Spain, forty-four of its ships had been
lost and most of the rest were too damaged to be seaworthy. Almost two-thirds
of its sailors and soldiers had perished at sea. Meanwhile England had lost not a
single ship, and barely a hundred men had died in action.
It was a great triumph, but Elizabeth wasted no time on gloating. To save
money, she immediately decommissioned the navy. She also refused to listen to
advisers who urged her to follow up her victory by attacking the Spanish in the
Low Countries. Her goals were limited: to exhaust Philip's resources and
finances, forcing him to abandon his dreams of Catholic dominance and
instituting a delicate balance of power in Europe. And this, indeed, was
ultimately her greatest triumph, for Spain never recovered financially from the
disaster of the Armada and soon gave up its designs on England altogether.
Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live economically in
normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us from
humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of world
conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, day and
night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, economy,
by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property and
prevent injury to the people.
 
THE I CHING, CHINA, CIRCA EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.
Interpretation
The defeat of the Spanish Armada has to be considered one of the most cost-
effective in military history: a second-rate power that barely maintained a
standing army was able to face down the greatest empire of its time. What made
the victory possible was the application of a basic military axiom: attack their
weaknesses with your strengths. England's strengths were its small, mobile navy
and its elaborate intelligence network; its weaknesses were its limited resources
in men, weaponry, and money. Spain's strengths were its vast wealth and its huge
army and fleet; its weaknesses were the precarious structure of its finances,
despite their magnitude, and the lumbering size and slowness of its ships.
Elizabeth refused to fight on Spain's terms, keeping her army out of the fray.
Instead she attacked Spain's weaknesses with her strengths: plaguing the Spanish
galleons with her smaller ships, wreaking havoc on the country's finances, using
special ops to grind its war machine to a halt. She was able to control the
situation by keeping England's costs down while making the war effort more and
more expensive for Spain. Eventually a time came when Philip could only fail: if
the Armada sank, he would be ruined for years to come, and even if the Armada
triumphed, victory would come so dear that he would ruin himself trying to
exploit it on English soil.
Understand: no person or group is completely either weak or strong. Every
army, no matter how invincible it seems, has a weak point, a place left
unprotected or undeveloped. Size itself can be a weakness in the end. Meanwhile
even the weakest group has something it can build on, some hidden strength.
