TRANSFORM YOUR WAR INTO A CRUSADE
MORALE STRATEGIES
The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to
think less about themselves and more about the group. Involve them in a cause, a
crusade against a hated enemy. Make them see their survival as tied to the
success of the army as a whole. In a group in which people have truly bonded,
moods and emotions are so contagious that it becomes easy to infect your troops
with enthusiasm. Lead from the front: let your soldiers see you in the trenches,
making sacrifices for the cause. That will fill them with the desire to emulate and
please you. Make both rewards and punishments rare but meaningful.
Remember: a motivated army can work wonders, making up for any lack of
material resources.
THE ART OF MAN MANAGEMENT
We humans are selfish by nature. Our first thoughts in any situation revolve
around our own interests: How will this affect me? How will it help me? At the
same time, by necessity, we try to disguise our selfishness, making our motives
look altruistic or disinterested. Our inveterate selfishness and our ability to
disguise it are problems for you as a leader. You may think that the people
working for you are genuinely enthusiastic and concerned--that is what they say,
that is what their actions suggest. Then slowly you see signs that this person or
that is using his or her position in the group to advance purely personal interests.
One day you wake up to find yourself leading an army of selfish, conniving
individuals.
You can do nothing with an army that is an amalgam of a hundred people
here, a hundred people there, and so on. What can be achieved with four
thousand men, united and standing shoulder to shoulder, you cannot do with
forty or even four hundred thousand men who are divided and pulled this way
and that by internal conflicts....

That is when you start thinking about morale--about finding a way to
motivate your troops and forge them into a group. Perhaps you try artfully to
praise people, to offer them the possibility of reward--only to find you have
spoiled them, strengthening their selfishness. Perhaps you try punishments and
discipline--only to make them resentful and defensive. Perhaps you try to fire
them up with speeches and group activities--but people are cynical nowadays;
they will see right through you.
The problem is not what you are doing but the fact that it comes late. You
have begun to think about morale only after it has become an issue, not before.
That is your mistake. Learn from history's great motivators and military leaders:
the way to get soldiers to work together and maintain morale is to make them
feel part of a group that is fighting for a worthy cause. That distracts them from
their own interests and satisfies their human need to feel part of something
bigger than they are. The more they think of the group, the less they think of
themselves. They soon begin to link their own success to the group's; their own
interests and the larger interests coincide. In this kind of army, people know that
selfish behavior will disgrace them in the eyes of their companions. They
become attuned to a kind of group conscience.
Morale is contagious: put people in a cohesive, animated group and they
naturally catch that spirit. If they rebel or revert to selfish behavior, they are
easily isolated. You must establish this dynamic the minute you become the
group's leader; it can only come from the top--that is, from you.
The ability to create the right group dynamic, to maintain the collective
spirit, is known in military language as "man management." History's great
generals--Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Napoleon--were all masters of the art,
which for military men is more than simply important: in battle it can be the
deciding issue, a matter of life and death. In war, Napoleon once said, "The
moral is to the physical as three to one." He meant that his troops' fighting spirit
was crucial in the outcome of the battle: with motivated soldiers he could beat an
army three times the size of his own.
To create the best group dynamic and prevent destructive morale problems,
follow these eight crucial steps culled from the writings and experiences of the
masters of the art. It is important to follow as many of the steps as possible; none
is less important than any other.
 
Step 1: Unite your troops around a cause. Make them fight for an idea. Now
more than ever, people have a hunger to believe in something. They feel an
emptiness, which, left alone, they might try to fill with drugs or spiritual fads,
but you can take advantage of it by channeling it into a cause you can convince
them is worth fighting for. Bring people together around a cause and you create a
motivated force.
What stronger breast-plate than a heart untainted! Thrice is he arm'd that
hath his quarrel just, And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel, Whose
conscience with injustice is corrupted.
KING HENRY V, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, 1564-1616
There are always moments when the commander's place is not back with his
staff but up with the troops. It is sheer nonsense to say that maintenance of
the men's morale is the job of the battalion commander alone. The higher the
rank, the greater the effect of the example. The men tend to feel no kind of
contact with a commander who, they know, is sitting somewhere in
headquarters. What they want is what might be termed a physical contact
with him. In moments of panic, fatigue, or disorganization, or when
something out of the ordinary has to be demanded from them, the personal
example of the commander works wonders, especially if has had the wit to
create some sort of legend around himself.
FIELD MARSHAL ERWIN ROMMEL, 1891-1944
The cause can be anything you wish, but you should represent it as
progressive: it fits the times, it is on the side of the future, so it is destined to
succeed. If necessary, you can give it a veneer of spirituality. It is best to have
some kind of enemy to hate--an enemy can help a group to define itself in
opposition. Ignore this step and you are left with an army of mercenaries. You
will deserve the fate that usually awaits such armies.
 
Step 2: Keep their bellies full. People cannot stay motivated if their material
needs go unmet. If they feel exploited in any way, their natural selfishness will
come to the surface and they will begin to peel off from the group. Use a cause--
something abstract or spiritual--to bring them together, but meet their material
needs. You do not have to spoil them by overpaying them; a paternalistic feeling
that they are being taken care of, that you are thinking of their comfort, is more
important. Attending to their physical needs will make it easier to ask more of
them when the time comes.
 
Step 3: Lead from the front. The enthusiasm with which people join a cause
inevitably wanes. One thing that speeds up its loss, and that produces discontent,
is the feeling that the leaders do not practice what they preach. Right from the
beginning, your troops must see you leading from the front, sharing their dangers
and sacrifices--taking the cause as seriously as they do. Instead of trying to push
them from behind, make them run to keep up with you.
 
Step 4: Concentrate their ch'i. There is a Chinese belief in an energy called
ch'i, which dwells in all living things. All groups have their own level of ch'i,
physical and psychological. A leader must understand this energy and know how
to manipulate it.
Idleness has a terrible effect on ch'i. When soldiers are not working, their
spirits lower. Doubts creep in, and selfish interests take over. Similarly, being on
the defensive, always waiting and reacting to what the enemy dishes out, will
also lower ch'i. So keep your soldiers busy, acting for a purpose, moving in a
direction. Do not make them wait for the next attack; propelling them forward
will excite them and make them hungry for battle. Aggressive action
concentrates ch'i, and concentrated ch'i is full of latent force.
During the Spring and Autumn era, the state of Qi was invaded by the states
of Jin and Yan. At first the invaders overcame the military forces of Qi. One of
the eminent nobles of the court of Qi recommended the martialist Tian Rangju
to the lord of Qi. To this man, later called Sima Rangju, is attributed the
famous military handbook "Sima's Art of War."...The lord of Qi then
summoned Rangju to discuss military matters with him. The lord was very
pleased with what Rangju had to say, and he made him a general, appointing
him to lead an army to resist the aggression of the forces of Yan and Jin.
Rangju said, "I am lowly in social status, yet the lord has promoted me from
the ranks and placed me above even the grandees. The soldiers are not yet
loyal to me, and the common people are not familiar with me; as a man of
little account, my authority is slight. I request one of your favorite ministers,
someone honored by the state, to be overseer of the army." The lord acceded
to this request and appointed a nobleman to be the overseer. Rangju took his
leave, arranging to meet the nobleman at the military headquarters at noon
the following day. Then Rangju hastened back to set up a sundial and a
water-clock to await the new overseer. Now this new overseer was a proud
and haughty aristocrat, and he imagined that as overseer he was leading his
own army. Because of his pride and arrogance, he did not see any need to
hurry, in spite of his promise with Rangju the martial master. His relatives
and close associates gave him a farewell party, and he stayed to drink with
them. At noon the next day, the new overseer had not arrived at headquarters.
Rangju took down the sundial and emptied the water-clock. He assembled the
troops and informed them of the agreement with the new overseer. That
evening the nobleman finally arrived. Rangju said to him, "Why are you
late?" He said, "My relatives, who are grandees, gave me a farewell party, so
I stayed for that." Rangju said, "On the day a military leader receives his
orders, he forgets about his home; when a promise is made in the face of
battle, one forgets his family; when the war drums sound, one forgets his own
body. Now hostile states have invaded our territory; the state is in an uproar;
the soldiers are exposed at the borders; the lord cannot rest or enjoy his food;
the lives of the common people all depend on you--how can you talk about
farewell parties?" Rangju then summoned the officer in charge of military
discipline and asked him, "According to military law, what happens to
someone who arrives later than an appointed time?" The officer replied, "He
is supposed to be decapitated." Terrified, the aristocrat had a messenger rush
back to report this to the lord and beseech him for help. But the haughty
nobleman was executed before the messenger even returned, and his
execution was announced to the army. The soldiers all shook with fear.
Eventually the lord sent an emissary with a letter pardoning the nobleman,
who was, after all, the new overseer of the army. The emissary galloped right
into camp on horseback with the lord's message. Rangju said, "When a
general is in the field, there are orders he doesn't take from the ruler." He
also said to the disciplinary officer, "It is a rule that there shall be no
galloping through camp, yet now the emissary has done just that. What
should be done with him?" The officer said, "He should be executed." The
emissary was petrified, but Rangju said, "It is not proper to kill an emissary
of the lord," and had two of the emissary's attendants executed in his stead.
This too was announced to the army. Rangju sent the emissary back to report
to the lord, and then he set out with the army. When the soldiers made camp,
Rangju personally oversaw the digging of wells, construction of stoves,
preparation of food and drink, and care of the sick. He shared all of the
supplies of the leadership with the soldiers, personally eating the same
rations as they. He was especially kind to the weary and weakened. After
three days, Rangju called the troops to order. Even those who were ill wanted
to go along, eager to go into battle for Rangju. When the armies of Jin and
Yan heard about this, they withdrew from the state of Qi. Now Rangju led his
troops to chase them down and strike them. Eventually he recovered lost
territory and returned with the army victorious.

Step 5: Play to their emotions. The best way to motivate people is not through
reason but through emotion. Humans, however, are naturally defensive, and if
you begin with an appeal to their emotions--some histrionic harangue--they will
see you as manipulative and will recoil. An emotional appeal needs a setup:
lower their defenses, and make them bond as a group, by putting on a show,
entertaining them, telling a story. Now they have less control over their emotions
and you can approach them more directly, moving them easily from laughter to
anger or hatred. Masters of man management have a sense of drama: they know
when and how to hit their soldiers in the gut.
 
Step 6: Mix harshness and kindness. The key to man management is a balance
of punishment and reward. Too many rewards will spoil your soldiers and make
them take you for granted; too much punishment will destroy their morale. You
need to hit the right balance. Make your kindness rare and even an occasional
warm comment or generous act will be powerfully meaningful. Anger and
punishment should be equally rare; instead your harshness should take the form
of setting very high standards that few can reach. Make your soldiers compete to
please you. Make them struggle to see less harshness and more kindness.
 
Step 7: Build the group myth. The armies with the highest morale are armies
that have been tested in battle. Soldiers who have fought alongside one another
through many campaigns forge a kind of group myth based on their past
victories. Living up to the tradition and reputation of the group becomes a matter
of pride; anyone who lets it down feels ashamed. To generate this myth, you
must lead your troops into as many campaigns as you can. It is wise to start out
with easy battles that they can win, building up their confidence. Success alone
will help bring the group together. Create symbols and slogans that fit the myth.
Your soldiers will want to belong.
 
Step 8: Be ruthless with grumblers. Allow grumblers and the chronically
disaffected any leeway at all and they will spread disquiet and even panic
throughout the group. As fast as you can, you must isolate them and get rid of
them. All groups contain a core of people who are more motivated and
disciplined than the rest--your best soldiers. Recognize them, cultivate their
goodwill, and set them up as examples. These people will serve as natural
ballasts against those who are disaffected and panicky.
You know, I am sure, that not numbers or strength brings victory in war; but
whichever army goes into battle stronger in soul, their enemies generally
cannot withstand them.
--Xenophon (430?-355? B.C.)
HISTORICAL EXAMPLES
1. In the early 1630s, Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658), a provincial gentleman
farmer in Cambridgeshire, England, fell victim to a depression and to constant
thoughts of death. Deep in crisis, he converted to the Puritan religion, and
suddenly his life took a new turn: he felt he had experienced a direct communion
with God. Now he believed in providence, the idea that everything happens for a
reason and according to God's will. Whereas before he had been despondent and
indecisive, now he was filled with purpose: he thought himself among God's
elect.
Eventually Cromwell became a member of Parliament and a vocal defender
of the common people in their grievances against the aristocracy. Yet he felt
marked by providence for something larger than politics: he had visions of a
great crusade. In 1642, Parliament, in a bitter struggle with Charles I, voted to
cut off the king's funds until he agreed to limits on royal power. When Charles
refused, civil war broke out between the Cavaliers (supporters of the king, who
wore their hair long) and the Roundheads (the rebels, so called since they
cropped their hair short). Parliament's most fervent supporters were Puritans like
Cromwell, who saw the war against the king as his chance--more than his
chance, his calling.
Although Cromwell had no military background, he hurriedly formed a
troop of sixty horsemen from his native Cambridgeshire. His aim was to
incorporate them in a larger regiment, gain military experience by fighting under
another commander, and slowly prove his worth. He was confident of ultimate
victory, for he saw his side as unbeatable: after all, God was on their side, and all
his men were believers in the cause of creating a more pious England.
Despite his lack of experience, Cromwell was something of a military
visionary: he imagined a new kind of warfare spearheaded by a faster, more
mobile cavalry, and in the war's first few months he proved a brave and effective
leader. He was given more troops to command but soon realized that he had
grossly overestimated the fighting spirit of those on his side: time and again he
led cavalry charges that pierced enemy lines, only to watch in disgust as his
soldiers broke order to plunder the enemy camp. Sometimes he tried to hold part
of his force in reserve to act as reinforcements later in the battle, but the only
command they listened to was to advance, and in retreat they were hopelessly
disordered. Representing themselves as crusaders, Cromwell's men were
revealed by battle as mercenaries, fighting for pay and adventure. They were
useless.
In 1643, when Cromwell was made a colonel at the head of his own
regiment, he decided to break with the past. From now on, he would recruit only
soldiers of a certain kind: men who, like himself, had experienced religious
visions and revelations. He sounded out the aspirants, tested them for the depth
of their faith. Departing from a long tradition, he appointed commoners, not
aristocrats, as officers; as he wrote to a friend, "I had rather have a plain russet-
coated captain that knows what he fights for, and loves what he knows, than that
which you call a gentleman and is nothing else." Cromwell made his recruits
sing psalms and pray together. In a stern check on bad discipline, he taught them
to see all their actions as part of God's plan. And he looked after them in an
unusual way for the times, making sure they were well fed, well clothed, and
promptly paid.
When Cromwell's army went into battle, it was now a force to reckon with.
The men rode in tight formation, loudly singing psalms. As they neared the
king's forces, they would break into a "pretty round trot," not the headlong and
disorderly charge of other troops. Even in contact with the enemy, they kept their
order, and they retreated with as much discipline as when they advanced. Since
they believed that God was with them, they had no fear of death: they could
march straight up a hill into enemy fire without breaking step. Having gained
control over his cavalry, Cromwell could maneuver them with infinite flexibility.
His troops won battle after battle.
In 1645, Cromwell was named lieutenant general of the cavalry in the New
Model Army. That year, at the Battle of Naseby, his disciplined regiment was
crucial in the Roundheads' victory. A few days later, his cavalry finished off the
Royalist forces at Langport, effectively putting an end to the first stage of the
Civil War.
Interpretation
That Cromwell is generally considered one of history's great military leaders is
all the more remarkable given that he learned soldiery on the job. During the
second stage of the Civil War, he became head of the Roundhead armies, and
later, after defeating
