DENY THEM TARGETS
THE STRATEGY OF THE VOID
The feeling of emptiness or void--silence, isolation, nonengagement with others--
is for most people intolerable. As a human weakness, that fear offers fertile
ground for a powerful strategy: give your enemies no target to attack, be
dangerous but elusive and invisible, then watch as they chase you into the void.
This is the essence of guerrilla warfare. Instead of frontal battles, deliver
irritating but damaging side attacks and pinprick bites. Frustrated at their
inability to use their strength against your vaporous campaign, your opponents
will grow irrational and exhausted. Make your guerrilla war part of a grand
political cause--a people's war--that crests in an irresistible revolution.
THE LURE OF THE VOID
In 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte of France and Czar Alexander I of Russia signed a
treaty of alliance. Now the period's two great military powers were linked. But
this treaty was unpopular with the Russian court--among other things it allowed
Napoleon nearly free rein in Poland, Russia's traditional "front yard." Russian
aristocrats worked to influence the czar to repudiate it. Before too long,
Alexander began to take actions that he knew would displease the French, and
by August 1811, Napoleon had had enough: it was time to teach Russia a lesson.
He began to lay plans for an invasion. The acquisition of this vast territory to the
east would make him the ruler of the largest empire in history.
Some of Napoleon's ministers warned him of the dangers of invading such a
vast country, but the emperor general felt supremely confident. The Russian
army was undisciplined, and its officers were squabbling among themselves.
Two forces in Lithuania were positioned to block an invasion from the west, but
intelligence had revealed that they were unprepared. Napoleon would march into
a central position between these forces and defeat them in detail. He would
ensure victory by mobilizing an army three times larger than any he had
previously led: 650,000 men would march into Russia, 450,000 as part of the
main attack force, the rest to secure lines of communication and supply. With an
army this size, he could dominate even the large spaces of Russia, overwhelming
the feeble enemy not only with his usual brilliant maneuvers but with superior
firepower.
Napoleon may have felt certain of victory, but he was not a reckless man. As
always, he studied the situation from every angle. He knew, for instance, that
Russian roads were notoriously bad, local food supplies were meager, the
climate tended to extremes of heat and cold, and the vast distances made it much
harder to encircle the enemy--there was always room to retreat. He read up on
the failed invasion of Russia by the king of Sweden, Charles XII, in 1709, and
anticipated that the Russians might revert to a scorched-earth policy. His army
would have to be as self-sufficient as possible (the distances were too great to
have extended supply lines from Europe), but, given its size, that would require
incredible planning and organization.
To help provide for his army, Napoleon had vast storehouses close to the
borders of Russia filled with wheat and rice. He knew it would be impossible to
provide fodder for the 150,000 horses of his army, and so, thinking ahead, he
decided they would have to wait until June for the invasion, when the grasses of
the Russian plains would be rich and green. At the last minute, he learned Russia
had very few mills to grind grain into flour, so he added to his growing list the
need to bring materials to build mills along the way. With the logistical problems
addressed and his usual well-devised strategy in hand, Napoleon told his
ministers that he foresaw complete victory within three weeks. In the past, these
predictions of Napoleon's had been uncannily accurate.
In June 1812, Napoleon's vast armada of men and supplies crossed into
Russia. Napoleon always planned for the unexpected, but this time
unmanageable difficulties began to pile up almost immediately: rain, the bad
roads, the intense summer heat brought the army's movements to a crawl. Within
days more than 10,000 horses ate rank grass and died. Supplies were failing to
reach the forward troops fast enough, and they had to resort to foraging, but the
uncooperative Russian peasants along the march not only refused to sell their
food at any price but burned their hay rather than let the French have it. More
French horses died when they were forced to feed off the thatch in the roofs of
houses, only to find the houses collapsing on them. The two Russian armies in
Lithuania retreated too fast to be caught, and as they went, they burned crops and
destroyed all storehouses of food. Dysentery quickly spread through the French
troops; some nine hundred men died each day.
In his effort to catch and destroy at least a part of his elusive enemy,
Napoleon was compelled to march ever farther east. At points he came
tantalizingly close to the more northern of the two Russian armies, but his
exhausted men and horses could not move fast enough to meet or encircle it, and
it easily escaped his traps each time. June bled into July. Now it became clear
that the Russians would be able to join their two armies at Smolensk, over 200
miles east of where Napoleon had intended to fight them and a mere 280 miles
from Moscow. Napoleon had to call a halt and rethink his plan.
In addition to wasting an ever-increasing proportion of French manpower,
the elusive Russian tactics also contributed to the mental as well as physical
exhaustion of Napolean's forces. Tip and run raids by small bands of
Cossacks were continuous and exercised a baleful influence far in excess of
the military danger they represented. The French army became increasingly
subject to fits of the jitters. Captain Roeder noted one typical example in his
diary. The Hessian troops were mustering for parade before the Emperor's
quarters at Vitebsk on August 17, when "everything was suddenly thrown into
ridiculous uproar because a few Cossacks had been sighted, who were said to
have carried off a forager. The entire garrison sprang to arms, and when they
had ridden out it was discovered that we were really surrounded by only a
few dozen Cossacks who were dodging about hither and thither. In this way
they will be able to bring the whole garrison to hospital in about fourteen
days without losing a single man."
THE CAMPAIGNS OF NAPOLEON, DAVID G. CHANDLER, 1966
Thousands of French soldiers had succumbed to disease and hunger without
a single battle's being fought. The army was strung out along a 500-mile line,
parts of which were constantly harassed by small troops of Cossacks on
horseback, sowing terror with their bloodthirsty raids. Napoleon could not allow
the chase to go on any longer--he would march his men to Smolensk and fight
the decisive battle there. Smolensk was a holy city, with great emotional
significance to the Russian people. Surely the Russians would fight to defend it
rather than let it be destroyed. He knew that if he could only meet the Russians
in battle, he would win.
And so the French moved on Smolensk, arriving there in mid-August, their
450,000-man attack force reduced to 150,000 and worn down by the intense
heat. Finally, as Napoleon had predicted, the Russians made a stand here--but
only briefly; after several days of fighting, they retreated yet again, leaving
behind a burned and ruined city with nothing in it to feed on or plunder.
Napoleon could not understand the Russian people, who seemed to him suicidal-
-they would destroy their country rather than surrender it.
Now he had to decide whether to march on Moscow itself. It might have
seemed wise to wait through the winter at Smolensk, but that would give the
czar time to raise a larger army that would prove too hard for Napoleon to handle
with his own depleted forces. The French emperor felt certain the czar would
defend Moscow, the very heart and soul of Russia. Once Moscow fell,
Alexander would have to sue for peace. So Napoleon marched his haggard
troops still farther east.
Now, at last, the Russians turned to face the French in battle, and on
September 7 the two armies clashed near the village of Borodino, a mere
seventy-five miles from Moscow. Napoleon no longer had enough forces or
cavalry to attempt his usual flanking maneuver, so he was forced to attack the
enemy head-on. The Russians fought bitterly, harder than any army Napoleon
had ever faced. Even so, after hours of brutal fighting, the Russians retreated yet
again. The road to Moscow lay open. But the Russian army was still intact, and
Napoleon's forces had suffered horrific casualties.
Seven days later Napoleon's army, now reduced to 100,000 men, straggled
into an undefended Moscow. A French marshal wrote to his wife that the
emperor's "joy was overflowing. 'The Russians,' he thinks, 'will sue for peace,
and I shall change the face of the world.'" In earlier years, when he had marched
into Vienna and Berlin, he had been met as a conquering hero, with dignitaries
turning over to him the keys to their cities. But Moscow was empty: no citizens,
no food. A terrible fire broke out almost immediately and lasted five days; all of
the city's water pumps had been removed--an elaborate sabotage to make
Moscow still more inhospitable.
Napoleon sent letters to the czar, offering generous terms of peace. At first
the Russians seemed willing to negotiate, but the weeks went by, and it finally
became clear that they were dragging out the talks to buy time to build up their
army--and to let winter grow closer.
Napoleon could not risk staying in Moscow another day; the Russians would
soon be able to encircle his now meager force. On October 19 he marched the
remains of his army out of the Russian capital. His goal was to get to Smolensk
as fast as possible. Now those undisciplined bands of Cossacks that had harassed
him on the road east had formed into larger divisions--guerrilla forces of 500
men--and every day they killed off more and more French soldiers. Marching in
constant fear, Napoleon's men rarely slept. Thousands succumbed to fatigue and
hunger. Napoleon was forced to lead them past the nightmarish fields of
Borodino, still crowded with French corpses, many half eaten by wolves. The
snow began to fall--the Russian winter set in. The French horses died from the
cold, and every last soldier had to trudge through the snow on foot. Barely
40,000 made it to Smolensk.
The cold was worsening. There was no time to tarry in Smolensk. Through
some deft maneuvering, Napoleon managed to get his troops across the Berezina
River, allowing them a clear line of retreat to the west. Then, in early December,
hearing of a failed coup d'etat at home in France, he left his troops behind and
headed for Paris. Of the 450,000 men in his main attack force, some 25,000
made it back. Few among the rest of the army survived as well. Napoleon had
miraculously escaped to fight more wars, but he would never recoup his losses in
manpower and horses. Russia was indeed his grave.
Interpretation
By the time Napoleon invaded Russia, Czar Alexander I had met him a number
of times in previous years and had come to know him quite well. The emperor,
Alexander saw, was an aggressive man who loved any kind of fight, even if the
odds were stacked against him. He needed battles as a chance to put his genius in
play. By refusing to meet him in battle, Alexander could frustrate him and lure
him into a void: vast but empty lands without food or forage, empty cities with
nothing to plunder, empty negotiations, empty time in which nothing happened,
and finally the dead of winter. Russia's harsh climate would make a shambles of
Napoleon's organizational genius. And as it played out, Alexander's strategy
worked to perfection. Napoleon's inability to engage his enemy got under his
skin: a few more miles east, one solid battle, and he could teach this cowardly
foe a lesson. His emotions--irritation, anger, confusion--overwhelmed his ability
to strategize. How could he have come to believe, for instance, that the fall of
Moscow would force the czar to surrender? Alexander's army was still intact, the
French had grown frighteningly weak, and winter was coming. Napoleon's mind
had succumbed to the powerful pull of the void that he had entered, and that led
him far astray.
Alexander's strategy wreaked havoc on the French soldiers as well, who
were renowned for their superior discipline and fighting spirit. A soldier can
endure almost anything except the expectation of a battle that never comes and a
tension that is never relieved. Instead of battle, the French got endless raids and
pinprick attacks that came out of nowhere, a continuous threat that gradually
built into panic. While thousands of soldiers fell to disease, many more simply
lost the will to fight.
It is human nature to not be able to endure any kind of void. We hate silence,
long stretches of inactivity, loneliness. (Perhaps this is related to our fear of that
final void, our own death.) We have to fill and occupy empty space. By giving
people nothing to hit, being as vaporous as possible, you play upon this human
weakness. Infuriated at the absence not just of a fight but of any kind of
interaction at all, people will tend to chase madly after you, losing all power of
strategic thought. It is the elusive side, no matter how weak or small its force,
that controls the dynamic.
The bigger the enemy, the better this strategy works: struggling to reach you,
the oversize opponent presents juicy targets for you to hit. To create the
maximum psychological disturbance, you must make your attacks small but
relentless, keeping your enemy's anger and frustration at a constant boil. Make
your void complete: empty negotiations, talks leading nowhere, time passing
without either victory or defeat. In a world of accelerated pace and activity, this
strategy will have a powerfully debilitating effect on people's nerves. The less
they can hit, the harder they will fall.
Most wars are wars of contact, both forces striving to keep in touch.... The
Arab war should be a war of detachment: to contain the enemy by the silent
threat of a vast unknown desert, not disclosing themselves till the moment of
attack.... From this theory came to be developed ultimately an unconscious
habit of never engaging the enemy at all. This chimed with the numerical plea
of never giving the enemy's soldier a target.
--T. E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1926)
KEYS TO WARFARE
Over the centuries organized war--in all its infinite variations, from primitive to
modern, Asian to Western--has always tended to follow a certain logic, which is
so universal as almost to seem inherent to the process. The logic is as follows: A
leader decides to take his country to war and raises an army for that purpose.
That army's goal is to meet and defeat the enemy in a decisive battle that will
force a surrender and favorable peace terms. The strategist guiding the campaign
must deal with a specific area, the theater of war. This area is most often
relatively limited; maneuvering in vast open spaces complicates the possibility
of bringing the war to closure. Working within the theater of war, then, the
strategist contrives to bring his army to the decisive battle in a way that will
surprise the enemy or put it at a disadvantage--it is cornered, or attacked from
both front and rear, or must fight uphill. To keep his forces strong enough to
deliver a mortal blow, he concentrates them rather than dispersing them. Once
battle begins, the army will naturally form a flank and rear that it must protect
against encirclement, as well as lines of communication and supply. It may take
several battles to end the war, as each side works to dominate the key positions
that will give it control of the theater, but military leaders must try to end it as
quickly as possible. The longer it drags on, the more the army's resources are
stretched to a breaking point where the ability to fight collapses. Soldiers' morale
declines with time as well.
As with any human activity, however, this positive, orderly side generates a
negative, shadow side that contains its own form of power and reverse logic. The
shadow side is guerrilla warfare. The rudiments of guerrilla warfare originated
thousands of years ago, when smaller nations found themselves invaded by more
powerful neighbors; to survive, their armies were forced to flee the invader, for
any direct engagement would have destroyed them. It soon became clear that the
longer they fled and eluded battle, the more they ruined the enemy's strategies
and confused it by not conforming to the usual logic of engagement.
Such was the system Spain used against us. One hundred and fifty to two
hundred guerrilla bands scattered all over Spain had sworn to kill thirty or
forty Frenchmen a month each: that made six to eight thousand men a month
for all guerrilla bands together. The order was never to attack soldiers
traveling as a body, unless the guerrillas outnumbered them. But they fired on
all stragglers, attacked small escorts, and sought to lay hands on the enemy's
funds, couriers, and especially convoys. As all the inhabitants acted as spies
for their fellow citizens, the guerrillas knew when the convoys would leave
and how strong their escorts would be, and the bands would make sure they
were twice the size. They knew the country very well, and they would attack
furiously in the most favorable spot. Success often crowned the undertaking;
but they always killed a lot of men, and the goal was achieved. As there are
twelve months in the year, we were losing about eighty thousand men a year,
without any pitched battles. The war in Spain lasted seven years, so over five
hundred men were killed.... But that includes only those killed by the
guerrillas. Add the battles of Salamanca, Talavera, and Vitoria, and several
others that our troops lost; the sieges,...the fruitless attack on Cadiz; add too
the invasion and evacuation of Portugal, the fevers and various illnesses that
the temperature caused our soldiers to suffer, and you will see that we could
add a further three hundred thousand men to that number during those seven
years....... From what has been said, it will be apparent that the prime aim of
this sort of war is to bring about the destruction of the enemy almost without
him noticing it, and as a drop of water dripping on a stone will eventually dig
a hole in the stone, patience and perseverance are needed, always following
the same system. In the long run, the enemy will suffer more from this than he
would from losing pitched battles.
ON PARTISANS AND IRREGULAR FORCES, J.F.A. LE MIERE DE
CORVEY, 1823
The next step was to take this further: these early guerrilla warriors learned
the value of operating in small, dispersed bands as opposed to a concentrated
army, keeping in constant motion, never forming a front, flank, or rear for the
other side to hit. The enemy would want to keep the war confined to a particular
space; better, then, to extend it over as much territory as possible, melting into
the countryside, forcing the enemy to disperse itself in the chase, opening itself
up to raids and pinprick attacks. The enemy would naturally want a quick end to
the war, so it was desirable to drag it out as long as possible, making time an
offensive weapon that consumed the enemy with friction and sagging morale.
In this way, over thousands of years and through trial and error, the art of
guerrilla warfare developed and was refined into its present-day form.
Conventional military training and thought revolve around concentrating for
battle, maneuvering within limited areas, and straining for the quick kill.
Guerrilla warfare's reversal of this natural order of war makes it impossible for a
conventional army to counter--hence its power. In the shadow land of reverse
warfare, where none of the normal rules apply, the co
