OCCUPY THE MORAL HIGH GROUND
THE RIGHTEOUS STRATEGY
In a political world, the cause you are fighting for must seem more just than the
enemy's. Think of this as moral terrain that you and the other side are fighting
over; by questioning your enemies' motives and making them appear evil, you
can narrow their base of support and room to maneuver. Aim at the soft spots in
their public image, exposing any hypocrisies on their part. Never assume that
the justice of your cause is self-evident; publicize and promote it. When you
yourself come under moral attack from a clever enemy, do not whine or get
angry; fight fire with fire. If possible, position yourself as the underdog, the
victim, the martyr. Learn to inflict guilt as a moral weapon.
THE MORAL OFFENSIVE
In 1513 the thirty-seven-year-old Giovanni de' Medici, son of the illustrious
Florentine Lorenzo de' Medici, was elected pope and assumed the name Leo X.
The church that Leo now led was in many ways the dominant political and
economic power in Europe, and Leo--a lover of poetry, theater, and painting, like
others in his famous family--wanted to make it also a great patron of the arts.
Earlier popes had begun the building of the basilica of St. Peter's in Rome, the
preeminent seat of the Catholic Church, but had left the structure unfinished. Leo
wanted to complete this mighty project, permanently associating it with his
name, but he would need to raise a fair amount of capital to be able to pay for
the best artists to work on it.
And so in 1517, Leo launched a campaign to sell indulgences. Then as now,
it was Catholic practice for the faithful to confess their sins to their priest, who
would enforce their contrition by assigning them a penance, a kind of worldly
punishment. Today this might simply be a prayer or a counting of the rosary, but
penances were once more severe, including fasts and pilgrimages--or financial
payments known as indulgences. The nobility might pay an indulgence in the
form of a saintly relic purchased for their church, a large expense that would
translate into the promise of a reduced time spent in purgatory after death
(purgatory being a kind of halfway house for those not evil enough for hell, not
good enough for heaven, so forced to wait); the lower classes might pay a
smaller fee to buy forgiveness for their sins. Indulgences were a major source of
church income.
For this particular campaign, Leo unleashed a squadron of expert indulgence
salesmen across Europe, and the money began to pour in. As his chief architect
for the completion of St. Peter's he appointed the great artist Raphael, who
planned to make the building a splendid work of art, Leo's lasting legacy to the
world. All was going well, until, in October 1517, news reached the pope that a
priest named Martin Luther (1483-1546)--some tiresome German theologian--
had tacked to the doors of the castle church of Wittenberg a tract called The
Ninety-five Theses. Like many important documents of the time, the tract was
originally in Latin, but it had been translated into German, printed up, and
passed out among the public--and within a few weeks all Germany seemed to
have read it. The Ninety-five Theses was essentially an attack on the practice of
selling indulgences. It was up to God, not the church, to forgive sinners, Luther
reasoned, and such forgiveness could not be bought. The tract went on to say
that the ultimate authority was Scripture: if the pope could cite Scripture to
refute Luther's arguments, the priest would gladly recant them.
The pope did not read Luther's writings--he preferred poetry to theological
discussions. And a single German priest surely posed no threat to the use of
indulgences to fund worthy projects, let alone to the church itself. But Luther
seemed to be challenging the church's authority in a broad sense, and Leo knew
that an unchecked heresy could become the center of a sect. Within recent
centuries in Europe, the church had had to put down such dissident sects by the
use of force; better to silence Luther before it was too late.
Leo began relatively gently, asking the respected Catholic theologian
Silvester Mazzolini, usually known as Prieras, to write an official response to
Luther that he hoped would frighten the priest into submission. Prieras
proclaimed that the pope was the highest authority in the church, even higher
than Scripture--in fact, that the pope was infallible. He quoted various
theological texts written over the centuries in support of this claim. He also
attacked Luther personally, calling him a bastard and questioning his motives:
perhaps the German priest was angling for a bishopric? Prieras concluded with
the words, "Whoever says that the Church of Rome may not do what it is
actually doing in the manner of indulgences is a heretic." The warning was clear
enough.
[Colonel John] Boyd paid particular attention to the moral dimension and the
effort to attack an adversary morally by showing the disjuncture between
professed beliefs and deeds. The name of the game for a moral design for
grand strategy is to use moral leverage to amplify one's spirit and strength
while exposing the flaws of competing adversary systems. In the process, one
should influence the uncommitted, potential adversaries and current
adversaries so that they are drawn toward one's philosophy and are
empathetic toward one's success.
THE MIND OF WAR: JOHN BOYD AND AMERICAN SECURITY, GRANT
T. HAMMOND, 2001
Leo had much on his mind during these years, including turmoil in the
Ottoman Empire and a plan to launch a new crusade, but Luther's response to
Prieras got his attention right away. Luther wrote a text in which he mercilessly
took apart Prieras's writings--the church, he argued, had failed to answer his
charges and to base its arguments on Scripture. Unless its authority in granting
indulgences and excommunicating heretics was rooted in the Bible, it was not
spiritual in nature but worldly, political, and that kind of authority could and
should be challenged. Luther published his text alongside Prieras's, allowing
readers to compare the two and come to their own conclusions. His direct
quotation of Prieras, his audacious and mocking tone, and his use of recently
developed printing technology to spread his message far and wide--all this was
quite shocking and new to church officials. They were dealing with a clever and
dangerous man. It was now clear to Leo that the war between the church and
Luther was a war to the death.
As the pope pondered how to get the German priest to Rome and try him as
a heretic, Luther accelerated his campaign, continuing to publish at an alarming
rate, his tone ever more vitriolic. In An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of
the German Nation, he claimed that Rome had used its spurious authority to
bully and cow the German people for centuries, turning Germany's kingdoms
into vassal states. The church, he said again, was a political power, not a spiritual
one, and to prop up its worldly rule it had resorted to lies, forged documents,
whatever means necessary. In On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, he
railed against the pope's lavish lifestyle, the whoring among the church
hierarchy, the blasphemous art Leo funded. The pope had gone so far as to have
staged an immoral and bawdy play by Machiavelli, called Mandragola, within
the Vatican itself. Luther juxtaposed the righteous behavior advocated by the
church with the way its cardinals actually lived. It was the pope and his
entourage, Luther charged, who were the real heretics, not he; in fact, the pope
was the Antichrist.
The central feature of the "exterior maneuver" is to assure for oneself the
maximum freedom of action while at the same time paralysing the enemy by a
multitude of deterrent checks, somewhat as the Lilliputians tied up Gulliver.
As with all operations designed to deter, action will of course be primarily
psychological; political, economic, diplomatic and military measures will all
be combined towards the same end. The procedures employed to achieve this
deterrent effect range from the most subtle to the most brutal: appeal will be
made to the legal formulae of national and international law, play will be
made with moral and humanitarian susceptibilities and there will be attempts
to prick the enemy's conscience by making him doubtful of the justice of his
cause. By these methods, opposition from some section of the enemy's internal
public opinion will be roused and at the same time some sector of
international public opinion will be whipped up; the result will be a real
moral coalition and attempts will be made to co-opt the more unsophisticated
sympathizers by arguments based upon their own preconceived ideas. This
climate of opinion will be exploited at the United Nations, for instance, or at
other international gatherings; primarily, however, it will be used as a threat
to prevent the enemy undertaking some particular action.... It is a point worth
noting that, just as in military operations one captures a position on the
ground and thereby denies it to the enemy, on the psychological plane it is
possible to take over abstract positions and equally deny them to the other
side. The [leaders of the] Soviet Union for instance,...have turned into their
own preserve the peace platform, that of the abolition of atomic weapons
(while themselves continuing to develop them) and that of anti-colonialism
while themselves ruling the only colonial empire still in existence.... It may
therefore be that these ideological positions occupied by the forces of
Marxism may one day be "conquered" by the West; but this presupposes that
the latter in their indirect strategy have learned the value of thinking and
calculating instead of merely trying to apply juridical or moral principles
which their enemy can use against them at every turn.
INTRODUCTION TO STRATEGY, ANDRE BEAUFRE, 1963
It seemed to Leo that Luther had responded to Prieras's threat by raising the
temperature. Clearly the threat had been weak; the pope had been too lenient. It
was time to show real force and end this war. So Leo wrote a papal bull
threatening Luther with excommunication. He also sent church officials to
Germany to negotiate the priest's arrest and imprisonment. These officials,
however, came back with shocking news that altered everything: in the few short
years since the publication of The Ninety-five Theses, Martin Luther, an
unknown German priest, had somehow become a sensation, a celebrity, a
beloved figure throughout the country. Everywhere the pope's officials went,
they were heckled, even threatened with stoning. Shop windows in almost every
German town contained paintings of Luther with a halo over his head. "Nine-
tenths of the Germans shout 'Long live Luther,'" one official reported to Leo,
"and the other tenth 'Death to Rome.'" Luther had somehow aroused the German
public's latent resentment and hatred of the church. And his reputation was
impeccable: he was a bestselling author, yet he refused the income from his
writings, clearly practicing what he preached. The more the church attacked him,
the more popular Luther became. To make a martyr of him now could spark a
revolution.
Nevertheless, in 1521, Leo ordered Luther to appear in the town of Worms
before the Imperial Diet, a gathering of German princes, nobles, and clergy
organized by the newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Leo hoped to
get the Germans to do his dirty work, and Charles was amenable: a political
creature, worried by the antiauthoritarian sentiments that Luther had sparked, he
wanted the dispute over. At the Diet he demanded that the priest recant his
teachings. But Luther, as usual, refused, and in dramatic fashion, uttering the
memorable line "Here I stand. I cannot do otherwise. God help me." The
emperor had no choice; he condemned Luther as a heretic and ordered him to
return to Wittenberg to await his fate. On the way home, however, Luther was
kidnapped and taken to Warburg Castle. The kidnapping had actually been
planned and executed by his many supporters among the aristocracy; he was
safe. Living in the castle under an assumed name, he was able to ride out the
storm.
Leo died that year, and within months of his death, Luther's ideas and the
reforms that he had advocated had spread throughout Germany like wildfire. By
1526 a Protestant party was officially recognized in different parts of Europe.
This was the birth of the Reformation, and with it the vast worldly power of the
Catholic Church, at least as Leo had inherited it, was irrevocably broken. That
obscure, pedantic Wittenberg priest had somehow won the war.
Interpretation
Luther's original intention in his Ninety-five Theses was to discuss a point of
theology: the relationship, or lack of it, between God's forgiveness and papal
indulgences. But when he read Prieras's response to his argument, something
changed in him. The pope and his men had failed to find justification for
indulgences in the Bible. There was much more they could not justify as well,
such as the pope's unlimited power to excommunicate. Luther came to believe
that the church needed drastic reform.
Reformation, however, would require political power. If Luther simply railed
at the church's wickedness from the pulpit or among his fellow priests, he would
get nowhere. The pope and his men had attacked him personally, questioning his
motives; now Luther in turn would go on the offensive, fighting fire with fire.
Luther's strategy was to make the war public, transforming his moral cause
into a political one. He did this by exploiting the previous century's advances in
printing technology: his tracts, written in vigorous, angry language that appealed
to the masses, were widely disseminated. He chose points of attack that would
particularly outrage the German people: the pope's decadent lifestyle, funded
through the sale of indulgences; the use of church power to meddle in German
politics; on and on. Perhaps most devastating of all, Luther exposed the church's
hypocrisies. Through these various tactics, he was able to spark and stoke a
moral anger that spread like fire, forever tainting the public's vision not just of
the pope but of the church itself.
Luther knew that Leo would respond to him not with arguments based on the
Bible but with heavy-handed force, which, he also knew, would only make his
cause shine all the brighter. And so with incendiary language and arguments that
questioned Leo's authority, he baited the pope into rash counterattacks. Luther
already led an exemplary life, but he took it further by refusing all income from
his writings. This widely known move in effect made his goodness theatrical, a
matter for public consumption. In a few short years, Luther gained so much
support among the masses that the pope could not fight him without provoking a
revolution. By using morality so consciously and publicly, he transformed it into
a strategy for winning power. The Reformation was one of the greatest political
victories in history.
Understand: you cannot win wars without public and political support, but
people will balk at joining your side or cause unless it seems righteous and just.
And as Luther realized, presenting your cause as just takes strategy and
showmanship. First, it is wise to pick a fight with an enemy that you can portray
as authoritarian, hypocritical, and power-hungry. Using all available media, you
strike first with a moral offensive against the opponent's points of vulnerability.
You make your language strong and appealing to the masses, and craft it, if you
can, to give people the opportunity to express a hostility they already feel. You
quote your enemies' own words back at them to make your attacks seem fair,
almost disinterested. You create a moral taint that sticks to them like glue.
Baiting them into a heavy-handed counterattack will win you even more public
support. Instead of trumpeting your own goodness--which would make you seem
smug and arrogant--you show it through the contrast between their unreasonable
actions and your own crusading deeds. Aim at them the most withering charge of
all--that they are after power, while you are motivated by something higher and
selfless.
Do not worry about the manipulations you will have to resort to if you are to
win this moral battle. Making a public show that your cause is more just than the
enemy's will amply distract people from the means you employ.
There always are concrete human groupings which fight other concrete
human groupings in the name of justice, humanity, order, or peace. When
being reproached for immorality and cynicism, the spectator of political
phenomena can always recognize in such reproaches a political weapon used
in actual combat.
--Carl Schmitt (1888-1985)
KEYS TO WARFARE
In almost all cultures, morality--the definition of good and evil--originated as a
way to differentiate one class of people from another. In ancient Greece, for
example, the word for "good" was first associated with the nobility, the higher
classes who served the state and proved their bravery on the battlefield; the bad--
the base, self-centered, and cowardly--were generally the lower classes. Over
time a system of ethics evolved that served a similar but more sophisticated
function: to keep society orderly by separating the antisocial and "evil" from the
social and "good." Societies use ideas about what is and is not moral to create
values that serve them well. When these values fall behind the times or
otherwise cease to fit, morality slowly shifts and evolves.
There are individuals and groups, however, who use morality for a much
different purpose--not to maintain social order but to extract an advantage in a
competitive situation, such as war, politics or business. In their hands morality
becomes a weapon they wield to attract attention to their cause while distracting
attention from the nastier, less noble actions inevitable in any power struggle.
They tend to play on the ambivalence we all have about conflict and power,
exploiting our feelings of guilt for their purposes. For instance, they may
position themselves as victims of injustice, so that opposing them seems wicked
or insensitive. Or they may make such a show of moral superiority that we feel
ashamed to disagree with them. They are masters at occupying the high ground
and translating it into some kind of power or advantage.
How should a regime pursue a counterguerrilla campaign? [Colonel John]
Boyd laid out an array of tools: Undermine the guerrillas' cause and destroy
their cohesion by demonstrating integrity and competence of government to
represent and serve the needs of the people rather than exploit and
impoverish them for the benefit of a greedy elite. (If you cannot realize such a
political program, Boyd noted, you might consider changing sides now to
avoid the rush later!) Take political initiative to root out and visibly punish
corruption. Select new leaders with recognized competence as well as
popular appeal. Ensure that they deliver justice, eliminate major grievances,
and connect the government with its grass roots.

T. HAMMOND, 2001
Let us call these strategists "moral warriors." There are generally two types:
unconscious and conscious. Unconscious moral warriors tend to be motivated by
feelings of weakness. They may not be so good at the straightforward game of
power, so they function by making other people feel guilty and morally inferior--
an unconscious, reflexive way of leveling the playing field. Despite their
apparent fragility, they are dangerous on an individual level, because they seem
so sincere and can have great power over people's emotions. Conscious moral
warriors are those who use the strategy knowingly. They are most dangerous on
a public level, where they can take the high ground by manipulating the media.
Luther was a conscious moral warrior, but, being also a genuin
