MANEUVER THEM INTO WEAKNESS
THE RIPENING-FOR-THE-SICKLE STRATEGY
No matter how strong you are, fighting endless battles with people is exhausting,
costly, and unimaginative. Wise strategists generally prefer the art of maneuver:
before the battle even begins, they find ways to put their opponents in positions
of such weakness that victory is easy and quick. Bait enemies into taking
positions that may seem alluring but are actually traps and blind alleys. If their
position is strong, get them to abandon it by leading them on a wild-goose chase.
Create dilemmas: devise maneuvers that give them a choice of ways to respond--
all of them bad. Channel chaos and disorder in their direction. Confused,
frustrated, and angry opponents are like ripe fruit on the bough: the slightest
breeze will make them fall.
MANEUVER WARFARE
Throughout history two distinct styles of warfare can be identified. The most
ancient is the war of attrition: the enemy surrenders because you have killed so
many of its men. A general fighting a war of attrition will calculate ways to
overwhelm the other side with larger numbers, or with the battle formation that
will do the most damage, or with superior military technology. In any event,
victory depends on wearing down the other side in battle. Even with today's
extraordinary technology, attrition warfare is remarkably unsophisticated,
playing into humanity's most violent instincts.
Warfare is like hunting. Wild animals are taken by scouting, by nets, by lying
in wait, by stalking, by circling around, and by other such stratagems rather
than by sheer force. In waging war we should proceed in the same way,
whether the enemy be many or few. To try simply to overpower the enemy in
the open, hand to hand and face to face, even though you might appear to
win, is an enterprise which is very risky and can result in serious harm. Apart
from extreme emergency, it is ridiculous to try to gain a victory which is so
costly and brings only empty glory....
BYZANTINE EMPEROR MAURIKIOS, A.D. 539-602
Over many centuries, and most notably in ancient China, a second method of
waging war developed. The emphasis here was not destroying the other side in
battle but weakening and unbalancing it before the battle began. The leader
would maneuver to confuse and infuriate and to put the enemy in a bad position-
-having to fight uphill, or with the sun or wind in its face, or in a cramped space.
In this kind of war, an army with mobility could be more effective than one with
muscle.
The maneuver-warfare philosophy was codified by Sun-tzu in his Art of War,
written in China's Warring States period, in the fifth to third century B.C.--over
two hundred years of escalating cycles of warfare in which a state's very survival
depended on its army and strategists. To Sun-tzu and his contemporaries, it was
obvious that the costs of war went far beyond its body counts: it entailed a loss
of resources and political goodwill and a lowering of morale among soldiers and
citizens. These costs would mount over time until eventually even the greatest
warrior nation would succumb to exhaustion. But through adroit maneuvering a
state could spare itself such high costs and still emerge victorious. An enemy
who had been maneuvered into a weak position would succumb more easily to
psychological pressure; even before the battle had begun, it had imperceptibly
started to collapse and would surrender with less of a fight.
Several strategists outside Asia--most notably Napoleon Bonaparte--have
made brilliant use of maneuver warfare. But in general, attrition warfare is
deeply engrained in the Western way of thinking--from the ancient Greeks to
modern America. In an attrition culture, thoughts naturally gravitate toward how
to overpower problems, obstacles, those who resist us. In the media, emphasis is
placed on big battles, whether in politics or in the arts--static situations in which
there are winners and losers. People are drawn to the emotional and dramatic
quality in any confrontation, not the many steps that lead to such confrontation.
The stories that are told in such cultures are all geared toward such battlelike
moments, a moral message preached through the ending (as opposed to the more
telling details). On top of it all, this way of fighting is deemed more manly,
honorable, honest.
More than anything, maneuver war is a different way of thinking. What
matters here is process--the steps toward battle and how to manipulate them to
make the confrontation less costly and violent. In the maneuver universe,
nothing is static. Battles are in fact dramatic illusions, short moments in the
larger flow of events, which is fluid, dynamic, and susceptible to alteration
through careful strategy. This way of thinking finds no honor or morality in
wasting time, energy, and lives in battles. Instead wars of attrition are seen as
lazy, reflecting the primitive human tendency to fight back reactively, without
thinking.
In a society full of attrition fighters, you will gain an instant advantage by
converting to maneuver. Your thought process will become more fluid, more on
the side of life, and you will be able to thrive off the rigid, battle-obsessed
tendencies of the people around you. By always thinking first about the overall
situation and about how to maneuver people into positions of weakness rather
than fight them, you will make your battles less bloody--which, since life is long
and conflict is endless, is wise if you want a fruitful and enduring career. And a
war of maneuver is just as decisive as a war of attrition. Think of weakening
your enemies as ripening them like grain, ready to be cut down at the right
moment.
The following are the four main principles of maneuver warfare:
 
Craft a plan with branches. Maneuver warfare depends on planning, and the
plan has to be right. Too rigid and you leave yourself no room to adjust to the
inevitable chaos and friction of war; too loose and unforeseen events will
confuse and overwhelm you. The perfect plan stems from a detailed analysis of
the situation, which allows you to decide on the best direction to follow or the
perfect position to occupy and suggests several effective options (branches) to
take, depending on what the enemy throws at you. A plan with branches lets you
outmaneuver your enemy because your responses to changing circumstances are
faster and more rational.
 
Give yourself room to maneuver. You cannot be mobile, you cannot maneuver
freely, if you put yourself in cramped spaces or tie yourself down to positions
that do not allow you to move. Consider the ability to move and keeping open
more options than your enemy has as more important than holding territories or
possessions. You want open space, not dead positions. This means not burdening
yourself with commitments that will limit your options. It means not taking
stances that leave you nowhere to go. The need for space is psychological as
well as physical: you must have an unfettered mind to create anything
worthwhile.
 
Give your enemy dilemmas, not problems. Most of your opponents are likely
to be clever and resourceful; if your maneuvers simply present them with a
problem, they will inevitably solve it. But a dilemma is different: whatever they
do, however they respond--retreat, advance, stay still--they are still in trouble.
Make every option bad: if you maneuver quickly to a point, for instance, you can
force your enemies either to fight before they are ready or to retreat. Try
constantly to put them in positions that seem alluring but are traps.
 
Create maximum disorder. Your enemy depends on being able to read you, to
get some sense of your intentions. The goal of your maneuvers should be to
make that impossible, to send the enemy on a wild-goose chase for meaningless
information, to create ambiguity as to which way you are going to jump. The
more you break down people's ability to reason about you, the more disorder you
inject into their system. The disorder you create is controlled and purposeful, at
least for you. The disorder the enemy suffers is debilitating and destructive.
So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest
excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy's army without
fighting at all.
--Sun-tzu (fourth century B.C.)
HISTORICAL EXAMPLES
1. On November 10, 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte completed the coup d'etat that
brought him to power as first consul, giving him near-complete control of the
French state. For over ten years, France had been convulsed with revolution and
war. Now that Napoleon was leader, his most pressing need was peace, to give
the country time to recoup and himself time to consolidate his power--but peace
would not come easily.
France had a bitter enemy in Austria, which had put two large armies in the
field, ready to move against Napoleon: one to the east of the Rhine and the other
in northern Italy under General Michael Melas. The Austrians were clearly
planning a major campaign. Waiting was too dangerous; Napoleon had to seize
the initiative. He had to defeat at least one of these armies if he were to force
Austria to negotiate peace on his terms. The one trump card he had was that
several months earlier a French army had gained control of Switzerland. There
were also French troops in northern Italy, which Napoleon had taken from the
Austrians several years earlier.
To plan for the first real campaign under his direction, Napoleon holed
himself up in his office for several days. His secretary, Louis de Bourienne,
would recall seeing him lying on giant maps of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy
laid out wall to wall on the floor. The desks were piled high with reconnaissance
reports. On hundreds of note cards organized into boxes, Napoleon had
calculated the Austrians' reactions to the feints he was planning. Muttering to
himself on the floor, he mulled over every permutation of attack and
counterattack.
"Addicts of attrition," as Simpkin calls them, generally cannot think beyond
the battle, and they consider that the only way--or at least the preferred way--
to defeat an enemy is to destroy the physical components of his army,
especially the combat portions (armored fighting vehicles, troops, guns, etc.).
If the attrition addict appreciates war's intangibles at all (such as morale,
initiative, and shock), he sees them only as combat multipliers with which to
fight the attrition battle better. If the attrition warrior learns about maneuver,
he sees it primarily as a way to get to the fight. In other words, he moves in
order to fight. Maneuver theory, on the other hand, attempts to defeat the
enemy through means other than simple destruction of his mass. Indeed, the
highest and purest application of maneuver theory is to preempt the enemy,
that is, to disarm or neutralize him before the fight. If such is not possible, the
maneuver warrior seeks to dislocate the enemy forces, i.e., removing the
enemy from the decisive point, or vice versa, thus rendering them useless and
irrelevant to the fight. If the enemy cannot be preempted or dislocated, then
the maneuver-warfare practitioner will attempt to disrupt the enemy, i.e.,
destroy or neutralize his center of gravity, preferably by attacking with
friendly strengths through enemy weaknesses.
THE ART OF MANEUVER, ROBERT R. LEONHARD, 1991
By the end of March 1800, Napoleon had emerged from his office with a
plan for a campaign in northern Italy that went far beyond anything his
lieutenants had ever seen before. In the middle of April, a French army under
General Jean Moreau would cross the Rhine and push the eastern Austrian army
back into Bavaria. Then Napoleon would lead a 50,000-man force, already in
place in Switzerland, into northern Italy through several different passes in the
Alps. Moreau would then release one of his divisions to move south and follow
Napoleon into Italy. Moreau's initial move into Bavaria, and the subsequent
scattered dispatch of divisions into Italy, would confuse the Austrians as to
Napoleon's intentions. And if the Austrian army at the Rhine was pushed east, it
would be too distant to support the Austrian army in northern Italy.
Once across the Alps, Napoleon would concentrate his forces and link up
with the divisions under General Andre Massena already stationed in northern
Italy. He would then move much of his army to the town of Stradella, cutting off
communications between Melas in northern Italy and command headquarters in
Austria. With Melas's troops now isolated and the mobile French army within
reach of them, Napoleon would have many excellent options for dislocating and
destroying them. At one point, as he described this plan to Bourienne, Napoleon
lay down on the giant map on his floor and stuck a pin next to the town of
Marengo, in the center of the Italian theater of war. "I will fight him here," he
said.
A few weeks later, as Napoleon began to position his armies, he received
some troubling news: Melas had beaten him to the punch by attacking Massena's
army in Northern Italy. Massena was forced back to Genoa, where the Austrians
quickly surrounded him. The danger here was great: if Massena surrendered, the
Austrians could sweep into southern France. Also, Napoleon had been counting
on Massena's army to help him beat Melas. Yet he took the news with surprising
calm and simply made some adjustments: he transferred more men to
Switzerland and sent word to Massena that he must do whatever he could to hold
out for at least eight weeks, keeping Melas busy while Napoleon moved into
Italy.
Within a week there was more irritating news. After Moreau had begun the
campaign to push the Austrians back from the Rhine, he refused to transfer the
division that Napoleon had counted on for Italy, claiming he could not spare it.
Instead he sent a smaller, less experienced division. The French army in
Switzerland had already begun the dangerous crossings through the Alps.
Napoleon had no choice but to take what Moreau gave him.
By May 24, Napoleon had brought his army safely into Italy. Absorbed with
the siege at Genoa, Melas ignored reports of French movements to the north.
Next Napoleon advanced to Milan, close to Stradella, where he cut Austrian
communications as planned. Now, like a cat stealing up on its prey, he could wait
for Melas to notice the trap he was in and try to fight his way out of it near
Milan.
On June 8, however, once again more bad news reached Napoleon: two
weeks before he had hoped, Massena had surrendered. Napoleon now had fewer
men to work with, and Melas had won a strong base in Genoa. Since its
inception the campaign had been plagued with mistakes and unforeseen events--
the Austrians attacking early, Massena retreating into a trap at Genoa, Moreau
disobeying orders, and now Massena's surrender. Yet while Napoleon's
lieutenants feared the worst, Napoleon himself not only stayed cool, he seemed
oddly excited by these sudden twists of fortune. Somehow he could discern
opportunities in them that were invisible to everyone else--and with the loss of
Genoa, he sensed the greatest opportunity of all. He quickly altered his plan;
instead of waiting at Milan for Melas to come to him, he suddenly cast his
divisions in a wide net to the west.
Watching his prey closely, Napoleon sensed that Melas was mesmerized by
the movements of the French divisions--a fatal hesitation. Napoleon moved one
division west to Marengo, close to the Austrians at Genoa, almost baiting them
to attack. Suddenly, on the morning of June 14, they took the bait, and in
surprising force. This time it was Napoleon who had erred; he had not expected
the Austrian attack for several days, and his divisions were scattered too widely
to support him. The Austrians at Marengo outnumbered him two to one. He
dispatched urgent messages in all directions for reinforcements, then settled into
battle, hoping to make his small forces hold ground until they came.
The hours went by with no sign of aid. Napoleon's lines grew weaker, and at
three in the afternoon the Austrians finally broke through, forcing the French to
retreat. This was the ultimate downturn in the campaign, and it was yet again
Napoleon's moment to shine. He seemed encouraged by the way the retreat was
going, the French scattering and the Austrians pursuing them, without discipline
or cohesion. Riding among the men who had retreated the farthest, he rallied
them and prepared them to counterattack, promising them that reinforcements
would arrive within minutes--and he was right. Now French divisions were
coming in from all directions. The Austrians, meanwhile, had let their ranks fall
into disorder, and, stunned to find themselves facing new forces in this
condition, they halted and then gave ground to a quickly organized French
counterattack. By 9:00 P.M. the French had routed them.
Just as Napoleon had predicted with his pin on the map, he met and defeated
the enemy at Marengo. A few months later, a treaty was signed that gave France
the peace it so desperately needed, a peace that was to last nearly four years.
Aptitude for maneuver is the supreme skill in a general; it is the most useful
and rarest of gifts by which genius is estimated.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821
Interpretation
Napoleon's victory at Marengo might seem to have depended on a fair amount of
luck and intuition. But that is not at all the case. Napoleon believed that a
superior strategist could create his own luck--through calculation, careful
planning, and staying open to change in a dynamic situation. Instead of letting
bad fortune face him down, Napoleon incorporated it into his plans. When he
learned that Massena had been forced back to Genoa, he saw that the fight for
the city would lock Melas into a static position, giving Napoleon time to move
his men into place. When Moreau sent him a smaller division, Napoleon sent it
through the Alps by a narrower, more obscure route, throwing more sand in the
eyes of the Austrians trying to figure out how many men he had available. When
Massena unexpectedly surrendered, Napoleon realized that it would be easier
now to bait Melas into attacking his divisions, particularly if he moved them
closer. At Marengo itself he knew all along that his first reinforcements would
arrive sometime after three in the afternoon. The more disorderly the Austrian
pursuit of the French, the more devastating the counterattack would be.
Napoleon's power to adjust and maneuver on the run was based in his novel
way of planning. First, he spent days studying maps and using them to make a
detailed analysis. This was what told him, for example, that putting his army at
Stradella would pose a dilemma for the Austrians and give him many choices of
ways to destroy them. Then he calculated contingencies: if the enemy did x, how
would he respond? If part y of his plan misfired, how would he recover? The
plan was so fluid, and gave him so many options, that he could adapt it infinitely
to whatever situation developed. He had anticipated so many possible problems
that he could come up with a rapid answer to any of them. His plan was a mix of
detail and fluidity, and even when he made a mistake, as he did in the early part
of the encounter at Marengo, his quick adjustments kept the Austrians from
taking advantage of it--before they'd figured out what to do, he was already
somewhere else. His devastating freedom of maneuver cannot be separated from
his methodical planning.
Understand: in life as in war, nothing ever happens just as you expect it to.
People's responses are odd or surprising, your staff commits outrageous acts of
stupidity, on and on. If you meet the dynamic situations of life with plans that are
rigid, if you think of only holding static positions, if you rely on technology to
control any friction that comes your way, you are doomed: events will change
faster than you can adjust to them, and chaos will enter your system.
In an increasingly complex world, Napoleon's way o
