KNOW YOUR ENEMY
THE INTELLIGENCE STRATEGY
The target of your strategies should be less the army you face than the mind of
the man or woman who runs it. If you understand how that mind works, you have
the key to deceiving and controlling it. Train yourself to read people, picking up
the signals they unconsciously send about their innermost thoughts and
intentions. A friendly front will let you watch them closely and mine them for
information. Beware of projecting your own emotions and mental habits onto
them; try to think as they think. By finding your opponents' psychological
weaknesses, you can work to unhinge their minds.
THE MIRRORED ENEMY
In June 1838, Lord Auckland, the British governor-general of India, called a
meeting of his top officials to discuss a proposed invasion of Afghanistan.
Auckland and other British ministers had become increasingly concerned at
Russia's growing influence in the area. The Russians had already made an ally of
Persia; they were now trying to do the same with Afghanistan, and if they were
successful, the British in India would find themselves potentially cut off by land
to the west and vulnerable to more incursions by the Russians. Instead of trying
to outdo the Russians and negotiate an alliance with the Afghan ruler, Dost
Mahomed, Auckland proposed what he thought was a surer solution: invade
Afghanistan and install a new ruler--Shah Soojah, a former Afghan leader forced
out of power twenty-five years earlier--who would then be indebted to the
English.
He who knows the enemy and himself Will never in a hundred battles be at
risk.
 
SUN-TZU, FOURTH CENTURY B.C.
[As to the second case] , that of being drawn into one [a trap or ambush]
...you must be shrewd about not believing easily things not in accord with
reason. For example, if the enemy puts some booty before you, you ought to
believe that within it there is a hook and that it conceals some trick. If many
of the enemy are put to flight by your few, if a few of the enemy assail your
many, if the enemy turn in sudden flight,...you ought to fear a trick. And you
should never believe that the enemy does not know how to carry on his
affairs; rather, if you hope to be less deceived...and...run less risk, in
proportion as your enemy is weaker, in proportion as he is less cautious, you
should the more respect him.
THE ART OF WAR, NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI, 1521
Among the men listening to Auckland that day was William Macnaghten,
the forty-five-year-old chief secretary of the Calcutta government. Macnaghten
thought the invasion a brilliant idea: a friendly Afghanistan would secure British
interests in the area and even help to spread British influence. And the invasion
could hardly fail. The British army would have no trouble sweeping away the
primitive Afghan tribesmen; they would present themselves as liberators, freeing
the Afghans from Russian tyranny and bringing to the country the support and
civilizing influence of England. As soon as Shah Soojah was in power, the army
would leave, so that British influence over the grateful shah, although powerful,
would be invisible to the Afghan public. When it came time for Macnaghten to
give his opinion on the proposed invasion, his support of it was so sound and
enthusiastic that Lord Auckland not only decided to go ahead, he named
Macnaghten the queen's envoy to Kabul, the Afghan capital--the top British
representative in Afghanistan.
Meeting little resistance along the way, in August 1839 the British army
reached Kabul. Dost Mahomed fled to the mountains, and the shah reentered the
city. To the local inhabitants, this was a strange sight: Shah Soojah, whom many
could barely remember, looked old and submissive alongside Macnaghten, who
rode into Kabul wearing a bright-colored uniform topped by a cocked hat fringed
with ostrich feathers. Why had these people come? What were they doing here?
With the shah back in power, Macnaghten had to reassess the situation.
Reports came in informing him that Dost Mahomed was building an army in the
mountains to the north. Meanwhile, to the south, it seemed that in invading the
country the British had insulted some local chieftains by plundering their lands
for food. These chiefs were now stirring up trouble. It was also clear that the
shah was unpopular with his former subjects, so unpopular that Macnaghten
could not leave him and other British interests in the country unprotected.
Reluctantly Macnaghten ordered most of the British army to remain in
Afghanistan until the situation was stabilized.
Time went by, and eventually Macnaghten decided to allow the officers and
soldiers of this increasingly long-standing occupying force to send for their
families, so that life would be less harsh for them. Soon the wives and children
came, along with their Indian servants. But where Macnaghten had imagined
that the arrival of the soldiers' families would have a humanizing, civilizing
effect, it only alarmed the Afghans. Were the British planning a permanent
occupation? Everywhere the local people looked, there were representatives of
British interests, talking loudly in the streets, drinking wine, attending theaters
and horse races--strange imported pleasures that they had introduced to the
country. Now their families were making themselves at home. A hatred of
everything English began to take root.
THE AGING LION AND THE FOX
A lion who was getting old and could no longer obtain his food by force
decided that he must resort to trickery instead. So he retired to a cave and lay
down pretending to be ill. Thus, whenever any animals came to his cave to
visit him, he ate them all as they appeared. When many animals had
disappeared, a fox figured out what was happening. He went to see the lion
but stood at a safe distance outside the cave and asked him how he was. "Oh,
not very well," said the lion. "But why don't you come in?" But the fox said:
"I would come inside if I hadn't seen that a lot of footprints are pointing
inwards towards your cave but none are pointing out." Wise men note the
indications of dangers and thus avoid them.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
There were those who warned Macnaghten about this, and to all of them he
had the same answer: everything would be forgotten and forgiven when the army
left Afghanistan. The Afghans were childlike, emotional people; once they felt
the benefits of English civilization, they would be more than grateful. One
matter, however, did worry the envoy: the British government was unhappy
about the increasing expense of the occupation. Macnaghten would have to do
something to cut costs, and he knew just where to begin.
Most of the mountain passes through which Afghanistan's main trade routes
ran were held by the Ghilzye tribes, who for many years, over the lives of many
different rulers of the country, had been paid a stipend to keep the passes open.
Macnaghten decided to halve this stipend. The Ghilzyes responded by blocking
the passes, and elsewhere in the country tribes sympathetic to the Ghilzyes
rebelled. Macnaghten, caught off guard, tried to put these rebellions down, but
he did not take them too seriously, and worried officers who told him to respond
more vigorously were rebuked for overreacting. Now the British army would
have to stay indefinitely.
The situation deteriorated quickly. In October 1841 a mob attacked the home
of a British official and killed him. In Kabul local chiefs began to conspire to
expel their British overlords. Shah Soojah panicked. For months he had begged
Macnaghten to let him capture and kill his main rivals, an Afghan ruler's
traditional method of securing his position. Macnaghten had told him that a
civilized country did not use murder to solve its political problems. The shah
knew that the Afghans respected strength and authority, not "civilized" values; to
them his failure to deal with his enemies made him look weak and unrulerlike
and left him surrounded by enemies. Macnaghten would not listen.
The rebellion spread, and Macnaghten now had to confront the fact that he
did not have the manpower to put down a general uprising. But why should he
panic? The Afghans and their leaders were naive; he would regain the upper
hand through intrigue and cleverness. To that end, Macnaghten publicly
negotiated an agreement whereby British troops and citizens would leave
Afghanistan, in exchange for which the Afghans would supply the retreating
British with food. Privately, though, Macnaghten made it known to a few key
chiefs that he was willing to make one of them the country's vizier--and load
with him money--in exchange for putting down the rebellion and allowing the
English to stay.
Bait.--"Everyone has his price"--this is not true. But there surely exists for
everyone a bait he cannot help taking. Thus to win many people over to a
cause one needs only to put on it a gloss of philanthropy, nobility,
charitableness, self-sacrifice--and on to what cause can one not put it?--:
these are the sweetmeats and dainties for their soul; others have others.
HUMAN, ALL TOO HUMAN, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1886
The chief of the eastern Ghilzyes, Akbar Khan, responded to this offer, and
on December 23, 1841, Macnaghten rode out for a private meeting with him to
seal the bargain. After exchanging greetings Akbar asked Macnaghten if he
wanted to go ahead with the treachery they were planning. Thrilled to have
turned the situation around, Macnaghten cheerily answered that he did. Without
a word of explanation, Akbar signaled his men to grab Macnaghten and throw
him in prison--he had no intention of betraying the other chiefs. Along the way a
mob developed, caught hold of the unfortunate envoy, and with a fury built up
over years of humiliation literally tore him to pieces. His limbs and head were
paraded through the streets of Kabul, and his torso was hung from a meat hook
in the bazaar.
In a matter of days, everything unraveled. The remaining British troops--
some 4,500 of them, along with 12,000 camp followers--were forced to agree to
an immediate retreat from Afghanistan, despite the bitter winter weather. The
Afghans were to keep the retreating army supplied but did not do so. Certain that
the British would never leave unless forced to, they harassed them relentlessly in
their retreat. Civilians and soldiers alike quickly perished in the snow.
On January 13, British forces at the fort in Jalalabad saw a single horse
struggling toward the gates. Its half-dead rider, Dr. William Brydon, was the sole
survivor of the British army's doomed invasion of Afghanistan.
 
Interpretation The knowledge that would have averted the catastrophe was at
Macnaghten's fingertips long before he launched the expedition. Englishmen and
Indians who had lived in Afghanistan could have told him that the Afghan
people were among the proudest and most independent on the planet. To them
the image of foreign troops marching into Kabul would constitute an
unforgivable humiliation. On top of that, they were not a people yearning for
peace, prosperity, and reconciliation. In fact, they saw strife and confrontation as
a healthy way of life.
Macnaghten had the information but refused to see it. Instead he projected
onto the Afghans the values of an Englishman, which he mistakenly assumed
were universal. Blinded by narcissism, he misread every signal along the way.
As a result his strategic moves--leaving the British army occupying Kabul,
halving the Ghilzyes' stipend, trying not to overplay his hand in putting down the
rebellions--were exactly the opposite of what was needed. And on that fateful
day when he literally lost his head, he made the ultimate miscalculation,
imagining that money and an appeal to self-interest would buy loyalty among the
very people he had so humiliated.
Blindness and narcissism like this are not so rare; we find them every day.
Our natural tendency is to see other people as mere reflections of our own
desires and values. Failing to understand the ways they are not like us, we are
surprised when they do not respond as we had imagined. We unintentionally
offend and alienate people, then blame them, not our inability to understand
them, for the damage done.
Understand: if you let narcissism act as a screen between you and other
people, you will misread them and your strategies will misfire. You must be
aware of this and struggle to see others dispassionately. Every individual is like
an alien culture. You must get inside his or her way of thinking, not as an
exercise in sensitivity but out of strategic necessity. Only by knowing your
enemies can you ever hope to vanquish them.
Be submissive so that he will trust you and you will thereby learn about his
true situation. Accept his ideas and respond to his affairs as if you were twins.
Once you have learned everything, subtly gather in his power. Thus when the
ultimate day arrives, it will seem as if Heaven itself destroyed him.
--Tai Kung, Six Secret Teachings (circa fourth century B.C.)
THE CLOSE EMBRACE
In 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte humiliated the Austrians in the battles of Ulm and
Austerlitz. In the subsequent treaty, he carved up the Austrian Empire, taking
over its lands in Italy and Germany. For Napoleon all this was one part of a chess
game. His ultimate goal was to make Austria an ally--a weak and subordinate
ally, but one that would lend him weight in the courts of Europe, since Austria
had been a central force in European politics. As part of this overall strategy,
Napoleon requested a new Austrian ambassador to France: Prince Klemens von
Metternich, at the time the Austrian ambassador to the Prussian court in Berlin.
Confucius's evaluation of Yang Hu, a man who had been forced to flee from
one state to another because he proved greedy and disloyal each time he
acquired power, provides a simple example of projecting behavior on the
basis of constancy. Based upon this repeated behavioral pattern, Confucius
accurately predicted that Yang Hu would certainly suffer an ignominious end.
More generally, Mencius subsequently stated: "A man who ceases his efforts
where he should not will abandon them anywhere. A man who is
parsimonious with those with whom he should be generous will be
parsimonious everywhere." Granting that people generally acquire fixed
habits early in life, a man's end may therefore be foreseen by midlife:
"Someone who is still disliked at forty years of age will end by being so."
RALPH D. SAWYER, THE TAO OF SPYCRAFT, 1998
Metternich, then thirty-two, came from one of Europe's most illustrious
families. A speaker of impeccable French, a staunch conservative in politics, he
was a paragon of breeding and elegance and an inveterate ladies' man. The
presence of this polished aristocrat would add a sheen to the imperial court that
Napoleon was creating. More important, winning over a man of such power--and
Napoleon could be quite seductive in private meetings--would help in his grand
strategy of making Austria a weak satellite. And Metternich's weakness for
women would give Napoleon a way in.
The two men met for the first time in August 1806, when Metternich
presented his credentials. Napoleon acted coolly. He dressed well for the
occasion but kept his hat on, which in the mores of the time was rather rude.
After Metternich's speech--short and ceremonious--Napoleon began to pace the
room and talk politics in a way that made it clear he was in command. (He liked
to stand up to talk to people while they remained seated.) He made a show of
speaking pointedly and concisely; he was not some Corsican rube for the
sophisticated Metternich to play with. In the end he was sure he had made the
impression he wanted.
Coordination is less of a problem when political leaders themselves play an
active part in the intelligence effort. When he was Senate majority leader,
Lyndon Johnson cultivated an extensive intelligence system with sources all
over Washington. At one point in the 1950s, Johnson complained to a
reporter that he was focusing on internal Democratic problems while failing
to cover divisions in the Senate GOP. To make his point, he pulled out a
memorandum on a recent private meeting at which the reporter and several
of his colleagues had gotten a briefing on GOP factionalism from Senator
Thurston Morton (R-KY). Rowland Evans and Robert Novak recalled: "The
Intelligence System was a marvel of efficiency. It was also rather
frightening." Even in the White House, Johnson believed in firsthand political
intelligence. According to his aide Harry McPherson, "I guess he called a lot
of people, but I could usually count on it in the late afternoon, as he woke up
from his nap, that I would get a call which would usually say, 'What do you
know?'" McPherson would then pass along the latest news that he picked up
from reporters and political figures.
THE ART OF POLITICAL WARFARE, JOHN J. PITNEY, JR., 2000
Over the months to come, Napoleon and Metternich had many more such
meetings. It was the emperor's plan to charm the prince, but the charm ran
inescapably the other way: Metternich had a way of listening attentively, making
apt comments, even complimenting Napoleon on his strategic insights. At those
moments Napoleon would beam inside: here was a man who could truly
appreciate his genius. He began to crave Metternich's presence, and their
discussions of European politics became more and more frank. The two became
friends of sorts.
Hoping to take advantage of Metternich's weakness for women, Napoleon
set up his sister, Caroline Murat, to have an affair with the prince. He learned
from her a few pieces of diplomatic gossip, and she told him that Metternich had
come to respect him. In turn she also told Metternich that Napoleon was
unhappy with his wife, Empress Josephine, who could not bear children; he was
considering divorce. Napoleon did not seem upset that Metternich knew such
things about his personal life.
In 1809, seeking revenge for its ignominious defeat at Austerlitz, Austria
declared war on France. Napoleon only welcomed this event, which gave him a
chance to beat the Austrians still more soundly than before. The war was hard
fought, but the French prevailed, and Napoleon imposed a humiliating
settlement, annexing whole sections of the Austrian Empire. Austria's military
was dismantled, its government was overhauled, and Napoleon's friend
Metternich was named foreign minister--exactly where Napoleon wanted him.
Several months later something happened that caught Napoleon slightly off
guard but delighted him: the Austrian emperor offered him his eldest daughter,
the Archduchess Marie Louise, in marriage. Napoleon knew that the Austrian
aristocracy hated him; this had to be Metternich's work. Alliance by marriage
with Austria would be a strategic tour de force, and Napoleon happily accepted
the offer, first divorcing Josephine, then marrying Marie Louise in 1810.
Metternich accompanied the archduchess to Paris for the wedding, and now
his relationship with Napoleon grew still warmer. Napoleon's marriage made
him a member of one of Europe's greatest families, and to a Corsican, family
was everything; he had won a dynastic legitimacy he had long craved. In
conversation with the prince, he opened up even more than before. He was also
delighted with his new empress, who revealed a keen political mind. He let her
in on his plans for empire in Europe.
In 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia. Now Metternich came to him with a
request: the formation of an army of 30,000 Austrian soldiers at Napoleon's
disposal. In return Napoleon would let Austria rebuild its military. Napoleon saw
no harm in this step; he was allied with Austria by marriage, and rearmament
there would help him in the end.
Months later the Russian invasion had turned into a disaster, and Napoleon
was forced to retreat, his army decimated. Now Metternich offered his services
as a mediator between France and the other European powers. Centrally placed
as it is, Austria had performed that task in the past, and anyway
