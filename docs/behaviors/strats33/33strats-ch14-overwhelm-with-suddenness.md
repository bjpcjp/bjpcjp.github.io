OVERWHELM RESISTANCE WITH SPEED AND
SUDDENNESS
THE BLITZKRIEG STRATEGY
In a world in which many people are indecisive and overly cautious, the use of
speed will bring you untold power. Striking first, before your opponents have
time to think or prepare, will make them emotional, unbalanced, and prone to
error. When you follow with another swift and sudden maneuver, you will induce
further panic and confusion. This strategy works best with a setup, a lull--your
unexpected action catches your enemy off guard. When you strike, hit with
unrelenting force. Acting with speed and decisiveness will garner you respect,
awe, and irresistible momentum.
War is such that the supreme consideration is speed. This is to take advantage
of what is beyond the reach of the enemy, to go by way of routes where he
least expects you, and to attack where he has made no preparations.
 
SUN-TZU, FOURTH CENTURY B.C.
SLOW-SLOW-QUICK-QUICK
In 1218, Muhammad II, the shah of Khwarizm, received a visit from three
ambassadors on behalf of Genghis Khan, the leader of the Mongol Empire to the
east. The visitors bore magnificent gifts and, more important, the offer of a treaty
between the two powers that would allow the reopening of the lucrative Silk
Road connecting China and Europe. The shah's empire was immense,
incorporating present-day Iran and much of Afghanistan. His capital,
Samarkand, was fabulously wealthy, a symbol of his power, and increased trade
along the route would only add to these riches. Since the Mongols made it clear
they considered him the superior partner in the deal, the shah decided to sign the
treaty.
A few months later, a Mongol caravan arrived in the city of Otrar, in the
northeastern corner of the shah's empire, with the mission to buy luxury items
for the Mongol court. The governor of Otrar suspected the men in the caravan of
being spies. He had them killed, and he seized the goods they had brought to
barter. Hearing of this outrage, Genghis Khan dispatched an ambassador,
escorted by two soldiers, to the shah, calling for an apology. The demand--which
presumed to put the two empires on equal footing--incensed the shah. He had the
ambassador's head cut off and sent back to Genghis Khan. This, of course, meant
war.
The shah was not afraid: his army, anchored by its well-trained Turkish
cavalry, numbered over 400,000, at least twice the enemy's size. By defeating the
Mongols in battle, the shah could finally take over their land. He assumed the
Mongols would attack Transoxiana, the easternmost part of the shah's empire.
Bordered to the east by the five-hundred-mile-long Syr Dar'ya River, to the north
by the Kizil Kum Desert, and to the west by the Amu Dar'ya River,
Transoxiana's interior was also home to two of the most important cities of the
empire, Samarkand and Bukhara. The shah decided to establish a cordon of
soldiers along the Syr Dar'ya, which the Mongols would have to cross to enter
his empire. They could not cross from the north--the desert was impassable--and
to go to the south would be too great a detour. Keeping the bulk of his army in
the interior of Transoxiana, he would be able to place reinforcements where
needed. He had an impregnable defensive position and superiority in numbers.
Let the Mongols come. He would crush them.
In the summer of 1219, scouts reported that the Mongols were approaching
the southern end of the Syr Dar'ya, through the Fergana Valley. The shah sent a
large force, under the leadership of his son Jalal ad-Din, to destroy the enemy.
After a fierce battle, the Mongols retreated. Jalal ad-Din reported back to his
father that the Mongol army was not nearly as fearsome as their reputation. The
men looked haggard, their horses emaciated, and they seemed none too eager to
sustain a fight. The shah, believing the Mongols no match for his army, put more
troops at the southern end of the cordon and waited.
A few months later, a Mongol battalion appeared without warning in the
north, attacking the city of Otrar and capturing its governor--the same man
responsible for the outrage against the Mongol traders. The Mongols killed him
by pouring molten silver into his eyes and ears. Stunned by how quickly they
had managed to reach Otrar, and from an unexpected direction, the shah decided
to shift more troops to the north. These barbarians might move swiftly, he
reasoned, but they could not overcome an entrenched army with such great
numbers.
Next, however, two Mongol armies swept south from Otrar, running parallel
to the Syr Dar'ya. One, under General Jochi, began to attack key towns along the
river, while the other, under General Jebe, disappeared to the south. Like locusts,
Jochi's army swarmed through the hills and lowlands near the river. The shah
moved a good portion of his army to the river, keeping some reserves in
Samarkand. Jochi's force was relatively small, 20,000 at most; these mobile units
hit one position after another, without warning, burning forts and wreaking
havoc.
Reports from the front lines began to give the shah a picture of these strange
warriors from the east. Their army was all cavalry. Each Mongol not only rode a
horse but was trailed by several more riderless horses, all mares, and when his
own horse tired, he would mount a fresh one. These horses were light and fast.
The Mongols were unencumbered by supply wagons; they carried their food
with them, drank the mares' milk and blood, and killed and ate the horses that
had become weak. They could travel twice as fast as their enemy. Their
marksmanship was extraordinary--facing forward or in retreat, they could fire
arrows with remarkable dexterity, making their attacks far deadlier than anything
the shah's army had ever seen. Their divisions communicated over great
distances with flags and torches; their maneuvers were precisely coordinated and
nearly impossible to anticipate.
Dealing with this constant harassment exhausted the shah's forces. Now,
suddenly, the army under General Jebe that had disappeared to the south
reappeared heading northwest into Transoxiana at remarkable speed. The shah
hurriedly sent south his last reserves, an army of 50,000, to do battle with Jebe.
He still was not worried--his men had proved their superiority in direct combat,
at the battle in the Fergana Valley.
This time, however, it was different. The Mongols unleashed strange
weapons: their arrows were dipped in burning tar, which created smoke screens
behind which their lightning-quick horsemen advanced, opening breaches in the
lines of the shah's army through which more heavily armed cavalry would
advance. Chariots darted back and forth behind the Mongol lines, bringing up
constant supplies. The Mongols filled the sky with arrows, creating relentless
pressure. They wore shirts of heavy silk. An arrow that managed to pierce the
shirt would rarely reach the flesh and could be extracted easily by pulling at the
shirt, all of this done while moving at great speed. Jebe's army annihilated the
shah's forces.
The shah had one option left: retreat to the west, retrench, and slowly rebuild
his army. As he began preparations, however, something beyond belief occurred:
an army under Genghis Khan himself suddenly stood outside the gates of the
city of Bukhara, to the west of Samarkand. Where had they come from? They
could not have crossed the Kizil Kum Desert to the north. Their appearance
seemed all but impossible, as if the devil himself had conjured them up. Bukhara
soon fell, and within days Samarkand followed. Soldiers deserted, generals
panicked. The shah, fearing for his life, fled with a handful of soldiers. The
Mongols pursued him relentlessly. Months later, on a small island in the Caspian
Sea, abandoned by one and all, wearing rags and begging for food, the former
ruler of the wealthiest empire in the East finally died of hunger.
Interpretation
When Genghis Khan became the leader of the Mongol nation, he inherited
perhaps the fastest army on the planet, but their swiftness had translated into
limited military success. The Mongols might have perfected the art of fighting
on horseback, but they were too undisciplined to exploit any advantage they
gained this way or to coordinate for a large-scale attack. The genius of Genghis
Khan was to transform the chaotic Mongol speed into something organized,
disciplined, and strategic. He achieved this by adapting the ancient Chinese
strategy of slow-slow-quick-quick.
The first step, a "slow," was to meticulously prepare before any campaign,
which the Mongols always did to the highest degree. (In planning for the attack
on the shah, the Mongols learned of a guide who knew of a chain of oases across
the Kizil Kum Desert. This man was captured and later led Genghis Khan's army
across the forbidding territory.) The second "slow" was a setup, which involved
getting the enemy to lower its guard, lulling it into complacency. The Mongols,
for example, deliberately lost the first battle in the Fergana Valley to feed the
shah's arrogance. Then came the first "quick": fixing the enemy's attention
forward with a swift frontal attack (Jebe's raids along the river). The final
"quick" was a doubly swift blow from an unexpected direction. (Genghis's
sudden appearance before the gates of Bukhara is considered by many the
greatest military surprise in history.) A master of psychological warfare, Genghis
Khan understood that men are most terrified by the unknown and unpredictable.
The suddenness of his attacks made the speed of them doubly effective, leading
to confusion and panic.
We live in a world in which speed is prized above almost all else, and acting
faster than the other side has itself become the primary goal. But most often
people are merely in a hurry, acting and reacting frantically to events, all of
which makes them prone to error and wasting time in the long run. In order to
separate yourself from the pack, to harness a speed that has devastating force,
you must be organized and strategic. First, you prepare yourself before any
action, scanning your enemy for weaknesses. Then you find a way to get your
opponents to underestimate you, to lower their guard. When you strike
unexpectedly, they will freeze up. When you hit again, it is from the side and out
of nowhere. It is the unanticipated blow that makes the biggest impact.
The less a thing is foreseen, the more...fright does it cause. This is nowhere
seen better than in war, where every surprise strikes terror even to those who
are much the stronger.
--Xenophon (430?-355? B.C.)
CHEN/THE AROUSING (SHOCK, THUNDER)
The hexagram Chen represents the eldest son, who seizes rule with energy
and power. A yang line develops below two yin lines and presses upward
forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses terror. It is symbolized by
thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear and
trembling.
THE JUDGEMENT SHOCK brings success. Shock comes--oh, oh! Laughing
words--ha, ha! The shock terrifies for a hundred miles....
 
THE I CHING, CHINA, CIRCA EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.
KEYS TO WARFARE
In May 1940 the German army invaded France and the Low Countries using a
new form of warfare: the blitzkrieg. Advancing with incredible speed, the
Germans coordinated tanks and airplanes in an attack that culminated in one of
the quickest and most devastating victories in military history. The success of the
blitzkrieg was largely due to the Allies' static, rigid defense--similar to the shah's
defense against the Mongols. When the Germans breached this defense, the
Allies could not adjust or react in time. The Germans advanced faster than their
enemy could process what was happening. By the time the Allies decided upon a
counterstrategy it was too late--conditions had changed. They were always a step
behind.
Now more than ever, we find ourselves dealing with people who are
defensive and cautious, who begin any action from a static position. The reason
is simple: the pace of modern life is increasingly growing faster, full of
distractions, annoyances, and interruptions. The natural response for many is to
retreat inward, to erect psychological walls against the harsh realities of modern
life. People hate the feeling of being rushed and are terrified of making a
mistake. They unconsciously try to slow things down--by taking longer to make
decisions, being noncommittal, defensive, and cautious.
Blitzkrieg warfare, adapted for daily combat, is the perfect strategy for these
times. While those around you remain defensive and immobile, you surprise
them with sudden and decisive action, forcing them to act before they are ready.
They cannot respond, as they usually do, by being elusive or cautious. They will
most likely become emotional and react imprudently. You have breached their
defenses, and if you keep up the pressure and hit them again with something
unexpected, you will send them into a kind of downward psychological spiral--
pushing them into mistakes, which further deepens their confusion, and so the
cycle goes on.
Many of those who practiced a form of blitzkrieg warfare on the battlefield
used it to great effect in daily life. Julius Caesar--master of speed and surprise--
was a great example of this. From out of the blue, he might form an alliance with
a senator's bitterest enemy, forcing the senator either to change his opposition to
Caesar or to risk a dangerous confrontation. Equally, he might unexpectedly
pardon a man who had fought against him. Caught off guard, the man would
become a loyal ally. Caesar's reputation for doing the unpredictable made people
all the more cautious in his presence, further enhancing his ability to catch those
around him unawares.
But the genius in Ali takes his limitations and makes them virtues. Let us go
step by step. I can't think of a past heavyweight champion whose punching
power wasn't superior to Ali's. Yet in his first twenty fights, Ali, then Cassius
Clay, won every one of them, scoring seventeen knockouts.... So what is Ali's
mystery? Why does a man who every expert agrees has no punching power
knock most of his opponents out, including a one-punch K.O. over Sonny
Liston on Ali's first defense of his title? The answer is in speed and timing.
Clay then, and Ali now, has the ability to let punches go with extreme
quickness, but most important, at the right moment, just before the man in
front of him is able to put his boxer's sense of anticipation to work. When that
happens, the man getting hit doesn't see the punch. As a result, this man's
brain can't prepare him to receive the impact of the blow. The eyes couldn't
send the message back to the part of the body which would take the shock. So
we arrive at one knockout of a conclusion: the punch that puts you to sleep is
not so much the hard punch as the punch that you don't see coming.

This strategy works wonders on those who are particularly hesitant and
afraid of making any kind of mistake. In similar fashion, if you are facing an
enemy that has divided leadership or internal cracks, a sudden and swift attack
will make the cracks larger and cause internal collapse. Half of the success of
Napoleon Bonaparte's form of blitzkrieg warfare was that he used it against
armies of allies in which several bickering generals were in charge of strategy.
Once his army broke through these armies' defenses, dissension would break out
and they would fall apart from within.
The blitzkrieg strategy can be effective in diplomacy, too, as Henry
Kissinger demonstrated. The former U.S. secretary of state would often take his
time when beginning diplomatic negotiations, lulling the other side with bland
banter. Then, with the deadline for the end of the talks approaching, he would
suddenly hit them with a list of demands. Without enough time to process what
was happening, they became prone to giving in or to becoming emotional and
making mistakes. This was Kissinger's version of slow-slow-quick-quick.
For their initial thrust into France during World War II, the Germans chose to
attack through the Ardennes Forest in southern Belgium. The forest, considered
impenetrable by tank, was lightly guarded. Pushing through this weak point, the
Germans were able to build up speed and momentum. In launching a blitzkrieg,
you must begin by finding your enemy's weak point. Initiating the action where
there will be less resistance will allow you to develop crucial momentum.
The success of this strategy depends on three things: a group that is mobile
(often, the smaller the better), superior coordination between the parts, and the
ability to send orders quickly up and down the chain of command. Do not
depend on technology to accomplish this. During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
military might in fact have been hindered by its superior communications--too
much information to be processed made for slower response times. The North
Vietnamese, who depended on a well-coordinated network of spies and
informers, not gadgetry, made decisions more quickly and as a result were more
nimble on the ground.
Shortly after being elected president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed
to disappear from the public stage. The Depression was at its height, and for
many Americans this was not very reassuring. Then, with his inauguration,
Roosevelt changed tempo, giving a rousing speech that showed he had in fact
been meditating deeply on the issues facing the country. In the weeks that
followed, he came at Congress fast and furiously, with a series of bold legislative
proposals. The intensity of this new direction was felt all the more because of the
slow setup. More than mere drama, the momentum built by this strategy helped
Roosevelt to convince the public that he meant business and was leading the
country in the right direction. This momentum translated into support for his
policies, which in turn helped spur confidence and turn the economy around.
Veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered).
 
JULIUS CAESAR, 100-44 B.C.
Speed, then, is not only a powerful tool to use against an enemy, but it can
also have a bracing, positive influence on those on your side. Frederick the Great
noted that an army that moves quickly has higher morale. Velocity creates a
sense of vitality. Moving with speed means there is less time for you and your
army to make mistakes. It also creates a bandwagon effect: more and more
people admiring your boldness, will decide to join forces with you. Like
Roosevelt, make such decisive action as dramatic as possible: a moment of quiet
and suspense on the stage before you make your startling entrance.
Image: The Storm. The sky becomes still and calm, and a lull sets in,
peaceful and soothing. Then, out of nowhere, lightning strikes, the wind
picks up...and the sky explodes. It is the suddenness of the storm that is
so terrifying.
Authority: You must be slow in deliberation and swift in execution.
--Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821)
REVERSAL
Slowness can have great value, particularly as a setup. To appear slow and
deliberate, even a little foolish, will lull your enemies, infecting them with a
sleepy attitude. Once their guard is down, an unexpected blow from the side will
knock them out. Your use of slowness and speed, then, should be deliberate and
controlled, never a natural tempo that you fall into.
In general, when facing a fast enemy, the only true defense is to be as fast or
faster. Only speed can neutralize speed. Setting up a rigid defense, as the shah
did against the Mongols, only plays into the hands of the swift and mobile.
