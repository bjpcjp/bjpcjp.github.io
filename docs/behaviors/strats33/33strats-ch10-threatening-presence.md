CREATE A THREATENING PRESENCE
DETERRENCE STRATEGIES
The best way to fight off aggressors is to keep them from attacking you in the
first place. To accomplish this you must create the impression of being more
powerful than you are. Build up a reputation: You're a little crazy. Fighting you
is not worth it. You take your enemies with you when you lose. Create this
reputation and make it credible with a few impressive--impressively violent--acts.
Uncertainty is sometimes better than overt threat: if your opponents are never
sure what messing with you will cost, they will not want to find out. Play on
people's natural fears and anxieties to make them think twice.
If your organization is small in numbers, then do what Gideon did: conceal
the members in the dark but raise a din and clamor that will make the listener
believe that your organization numbers many more than it does.... Always
remember the first rule of power tactics: Power is not only what you have but
what the enemy thinks you have.
RULES FOR RADICALS, SAUL D. ALINSKY, 1972
REVERSE INTIMIDATION
Inevitably in life you will find yourself facing people who are more aggressive
than you are--crafty, ruthless people who are determined to get what they want.
Fighting them head-on is generally foolish; fighting is what they are good at, and
they are unscrupulous to boot. You will probably lose. Trying to fend them off
by giving them part of what they are after, or otherwise pleasing or appeasing
them, is a recipe for disaster: you are only showing your weakness, inviting
more threats and attacks. But giving in completely, surrendering without a fight,
hands them the easy victory they crave and makes you resentful and bitter. It can
also become a bad habit, the path of least resistance in dealing with difficult
situations.
Instead of trying to avoid conflict or whining about the injustice of it all,
consider an option developed over the centuries by military leaders and
strategists to deal with violent and acquisitive neighbors: reverse intimidation.
This art of deterrence rests on three basic facts about war and human nature:
First, people are more likely to attack you if they see you as weak or vulnerable.
Second, they cannot know for sure that you're weak; they depend on the signs
you give out, through your behavior both present and past. Third, they are after
easy victories, quick and bloodless. That is why they prey on the vulnerable and
weak.
Deterrence is simply a matter of turning this dynamic around, altering any
perception of yourself as weak and naive and sending the message that battle
with you will not be as easy as they had thought. This is generally done by
taking some visible action that will confuse aggressors and make them think they
have misread you: you may indeed be vulnerable, but they are not sure. You're
disguising your weakness and distracting them. Action has much more
credibility than mere threatening or fiery words; hitting back, for instance, even
in some small, symbolic way, will show that you mean what you say. With so
many other people around who are timid and easy prey, the aggressor will most
likely back off and move on to someone else.
This form of defensive warfare is infinitely applicable to the battles of daily
life. Appeasing people can be as debilitating as fighting them; deterring them,
scaring them out of attacking you or getting in your way, will save you valuable
energy and resources. To deter aggressors you must become adept at deception,
manipulating appearances and their perceptions of you--valuable skills that can
be applied to all aspects of daily warfare. And finally, by practicing the art as
needed, you will build for yourself a reputation as someone tough, someone
worthy of respect and a little fear. The passive-aggressive obstructionists who try
to undermine you covertly will also think twice about taking you on.
The following are five basic methods of deterrence and reverse intimidation.
You can use them all in offensive warfare, but they are particularly effective in
defense, for moments when you find yourself vulnerable and under attack. They
are culled from the experiences and writings of the greatest masters of the art.
 
Surprise with a bold maneuver. The best way to hide your weakness and to
bluff your enemies into giving up their attack is to take some unexpected, bold,
risky action. Perhaps they had thought you were vulnerable, and now you are
acting as someone who is fearless and confident. This will have two positive
effects: First, they will tend to think your move is backed up by something real--
they will not imagine you could be foolish enough to do something audacious
just for effect. Second, they will start to see strengths and threats in you that they
had not imagined.
A certain person said the following. There are two kinds of dispositions,
inward and outward, and a person who is lacking in one or the other is
worthless. It is, for example, like the blade of a sword, which one should
sharpen well and then put in its scabbard, periodically taking it out and
knitting one's eyebrows as in an attack, wiping off the blade, and then placing
it in its scabbard again. If a person has his sword out all the time, he is
habitually swinging a naked blade; people will not approach him and he will
have no allies. If a sword is always sheathed, it will become rusty, the blade
will dull, and people will think as much of its owner.

TSUNETOMO, 1659-1720
Reverse the threat. If your enemies see you as someone to be pushed around,
turn the tables with a sudden move, however small, designed to scare them.
Threaten something they value. Hit them where you sense they may be
vulnerable, and make it hurt. If that infuriates them and makes them attack you,
back off a moment and then hit them again when they're not expecting it. Show
them you are not afraid of them and that you are capable of a ruthlessness they
had not seen in you. You needn't go too far; just inflict a little pain. Send a short,
threatening message to indicate that you are capable of a lot worse.
 
Seem unpredictable and irrational. In this instance you do something
suggesting a slightly suicidal streak, as if you felt you had nothing to lose. You
show that you are ready to take your enemies down with you, destroying their
reputations in the process. (This is particularly effective with people who have a
lot to lose themselves--powerful people with sterling reputations.) To defeat you
will be costly and perhaps self-destructive. This will make fighting you very
unattractive. You are not acting out emotionally; that is a sign of weakness. You
are simply hinting that you are a little irrational and that your next move could
be almost anything. Crazy opponents are terrifying--no one likes fighting people
who are unpredictable and have nothing to lose.
 
Play on people's natural paranoia. Instead of threatening your opponents
openly, you take action that is indirect and designed to make them think. This
might mean using a go-between to send them a message--to tell some disturbing
story about what you are capable of. Or maybe you "inadvertently" let them spy
on you, only to hear something that should give them cause for concern. Making
your enemies think they have found out you are plotting a countermove is more
effective than telling them so yourself; make a threat and you may have to live
up to it, but making them think you are working treacherously against them is
another story. The more veiled menace and uncertainty you generate, the more
their imaginations will run away with them and the more dangerous an attack on
you will seem.
 
Establish a frightening reputation. This reputation can be for any number of
things: being difficult, stubborn, violent, ruthlessly efficient. Build up that image
over the years and people will back off from you, treating you with respect and a
little fear. Why obstruct or pick an argument with someone who has shown he
will fight to the bitter end? Someone strategic yet ruthless? To create this image,
you may every now and then have to play a bit rough, but eventually it will
become enough of a deterrent to make those occasions rare. It will be an
offensive weapon, scaring people into submission before they even meet you. In
any event, you must build your reputation carefully, allowing no inconsistencies.
Any holes in this kind of image will make it worthless.
Brinkmanship is...the deliberate creation of a recognizable risk, a risk that
one does not completely control. It is the tactic of deliberately letting the
situation get somewhat out of hand, just because its being out of hand may be
intolerable to the other party and force his accommodation. It means
harassing and intimidating an adversary by exposing him to a shared risk, or
deterring him by showing that if he makes a contrary move he may disturb us
so that we slip over the brink whether we want to or not, carrying him with
us.

DETERRENCE AND REVERSE INTIMIDATION IN PRACTICE
1. In March 1862, less than a year after the start of the American Civil War, the
Confederates' situation looked bleak: they had lost a series of important battles,
their generals were squabbling, morale was low, and recruits were hard to find.
Sensing the South's great weakness, a large Union army under Major General
George B. McClellan headed toward the Virginia coast, planning to march from
there west to Richmond, the capital of the South. There were enough
Confederate troops in the area to hold off McClellan's army for a month or two,
but Southern spies reported that Union troops stationed near Washington were
about to be transferred to the march on Richmond. If these troops reached
McClellan--and they were promised by Abraham Lincoln himself--Richmond
would be doomed; and if Richmond fell, the South would have to surrender.
The Confederate general Stonewall Jackson was based in Virginia's
Shenandoah Valley at the head of 3,600 men, a ragtag group of rebels he had
recruited and trained. His job was merely to defend the fertile valley against a
Union army in the area, but as he pondered the developing campaign against
Richmond, he saw the possibility of something much greater. Jackson had been a
classmate of McClellan's at West Point and knew that underneath his brash,
talkative exterior he was basically timid, overly anxious about his career and
making any mistakes. McClellan had 90,000 men ready for the march on
Richmond, almost double the available Confederate forces, but Jackson knew
that this cautious man would wait to fight until his army was overwhelming; he
wanted the extra troops that Lincoln had promised him. Lincoln, however, would
not release those forces if he saw danger elsewhere. The Shenandoah Valley was
to the southwest of Washington. If Jackson could possibly create enough
confusion as to what was happening there, he could disrupt the Union plans and
perhaps save the South from disaster.
On March 22, Jackson's spies reported that two-thirds of the Union army
stationed in the Shenandoah Valley, under General Nathaniel Banks, was
heading east to join McClellan. Soon an army near Washington, led by General
Irvin McDowell, would move toward Richmond as well. Jackson wasted no
time: he marched his men fast to the north to attack the Union soldiers still in the
valley, near Kernstown. The battle was fierce, and at the end of the day Jackson's
soldiers were forced to retreat. To them the engagement seemed to have been a
defeat, even a disaster: outnumbered nearly two to one, they had suffered terrible
casualties. But Jackson, always a hard man to figure out, seemed oddly satisfied.
One classic response to a particularly vicious beanball was exemplified by a
play Jackie Robinson made in the summer of 1953. Sal Maglie of the New
York Giants was "Sal the Barber," mostly because his high inside fast balls
"shaved" hitters' chins. Maglie was candid and friendly when he wasn't
pitching. "You have to make the batter afraid of the ball or, anyway, aware
that he can get hurt," Maglie told me matter-of-factly one afternoon over
drinks at his apartment in Riverdale. "A lot of pitchers think they do that by
throwing at a hitter when the count is two strikes and no balls. The trouble
there is that the knockdown is expected. You don't scare a guy by knocking
him down when he knows he's going to be knocked down." "Then when, Sal?"
I asked. "A good time is when the count is two and two. He's looking to swing.
You knock him down then and he gets up shaking. Now curve him and you
have your out. Of course, to do that you have to be able to get your curve
over the plate on a three-and-two count. Not every pitcher can." Maglie could
break three different curves over the plate, three and two. He had particular
success against such free-swinging sluggers as Roy Campanella and Gil
Hodges. But it is simplistic to say Maglie intimidated Campanella and
Hodges. Rather, his unpredictable patterns disrupted their timing and
concentration. He had less success with Pee Wee Reese and Jackie Robinson,
and one day in Ebbets Field, by throwing a shoulder-high fast ball behind
Robinson, Maglie brought matters to detonation. The knockdowns thrown at
[Cookie] Lavagetto, the fatal pitch thrown at Ray Chapman, roared toward
the temple. A batter gets away from that pitch by ducking backward.
(Chapman's freeze reaction, though not unknown, is rare.) Angered or
frustrated by Robinson that afternoon in Brooklyn, Maglie threw his best fast
ball behind the hitter, shoulder high. That was and is dangerous and
inexcusable. As a batter strides forward, he loses height. Reflex makes him
duck backward. A batter's head moves directly into the path of the fast ball
thrown behind him shoulder high. Robinson started to duck into Maglie's
pitch and then his phenomenal reflexes enabled him to stop, as it were, in
mid-duck. The ball sailed just behind the back of Robinson's neck. Robinson
glared but did not lose his poise. Maglie threw an outside curve, and
Robinson bunted toward Whitey Lockman, the Giant's first baseman. By
making Lockman field the bunt, Robinson was forcing Maglie to leave the
pitcher's mound and cover first. There he would be in Robinson's path, and
Jack, going at full and full-muscled tilt, intended to run over Maglie, signing
his name in spikes on the pitcher's spine. Saturnine, Faustian, brooding Sal
Maglie refused to leave the mound. At a critical moment, the Barber lost his
nerve. Davey Williams, the Giants' second baseman, rushed over, and as he
was reaching for Lockman's throw, Robinson crashed into him, a knee
catching Williams in the lower back. Robinson's knee was so swollen a day
later that he could not play. Williams never really recovered. He dropped out
of the major leagues two seasons later, at twenty-eight.... "Actually,"
Robinson himself said a few days later, "I'm sorry that Williams got hurt. But
when Maglie threw behind me, he was starting a really dangerous business,
and I was going to put a stop to it before he hit Gil or Campy or Pee Wee in
the head...." After that I saw Maglie start eight games against the Dodgers,
but I never saw him throw another fast ball behind a hitter. The grim,
intimidating beanballer had been intimidated himself, and by a bunt.
THE HEAD GAME, ROGER KAHN, 2000
A few days later, Jackson received the news he had been waiting for:
Lincoln had ordered Banks's army to return to the valley and McDowell's army
to stay where it was. The battle at Kernstown had gotten his attention and made
him worry--only a little, but enough. Lincoln did not know what Jackson was up
to or how large his army was, but he wanted the Shenandoah Valley pacified no
matter what. Only then would he release Banks and McDowell. McClellan was
forced to agree with that logic, and although he had the men to march on
Richmond right away, he wanted to wait for the reinforcements who would make
the attack a sure thing.
After Kernstown, Jackson retreated south, away from Banks, and lay low for
a few weeks. In early May, thinking that the Shenandoah Valley had been
secured, Lincoln sent McDowell toward Richmond, and Banks prepared to join
him. Again Jackson was ready: he marched his army in a completely bizarre
fashion, first to the east, toward McDowell, then back west into the Valley. Not
even his own soldiers knew what he was doing. Mystified by these strange
maneuvers, Lincoln imagined--but wasn't sure--that Jackson was marching to
fight McDowell. Once again he halted McDowell's march south, kept half of
Banks's army in the valley, and sent the other half to help McDowell defend
himself against Jackson.
Suddenly the Union's plans, which had seemed so perfect, were in disarray,
its troops too scattered to support each other. Now Jackson went in for the kill:
he linked up with other Confederate divisions in the area and, on May 24,
marched on the Union army--now divided and dangerously diminished--that
remained in the valley. Jackson maneuvered onto its flank and sent it in headlong
retreat north to the Potomac River. His pursuit of this army sent a wave of panic
through Washington: this now dreaded general, commanding forces that seemed
to have doubled in size overnight, was heading straight for the capital.
Secretary of War Edwin Stanton telegraphed Northern governors to alert
them to the threat and to muster troops for the city's defense. Reinforcements
quickly arrived to halt the Confederate advance. Meanwhile Lincoln, determined
to eliminate Jackson once and for all, ordered half of McDowell's army west to
join in the fight to destroy this pest and the other half to return to Washington to
secure the capital. McClellan could only agree.
Once again Jackson retreated, but by now his plan had worked to perfection.
In three months, with only 3,600 men, he had diverted well over 60,000
Northern troops, bought the South enough time to coordinate the defense of
Richmond, and completely altered the course of the war.
Interpretation
The story of Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley illustrates a simple
truth: what matters in war, as in life generally, is not necessarily how many men
you have or how well supplied you are but how your enemies see you. If they
think you are weak and vulnerable, they act aggressively, which in and of itself
can put you in trouble. If they suddenly think you are strong, or unpredictable, or
have hidden resources, they back off and reassess. Getting them to change their
plans and treat you more carefully can by itself alter the war. In any struggle,
some things will be outside your control; you may not be able to put together a
large army or defend all your weak points, but you can always affect people's
perceptions of you.
Jackson altered Union perceptions first by his bold attack on Kernstown,
which made Lincoln and McClellan think he had more troops than he did--they
could not imagine that anyone would be so stupid as to send only 3,600 men
against a Union stronghold. If Jackson was stronger than they had imagined, that
meant they needed more men in the Shenandoah Valley, which cut into the
troops available for the march on Richmond. Next Jackson began behaving
unpredictably, creating the impression of having not only a large army but also
some strange and worrying plan. Lincoln's and McClellan's inability to figure
out this plan stopped them in their tracks, making them divide their forces to
take care of the possible dangers. Finally Jackson attacked boldly one more time.
He did not have nearly enough men to threaten Washington, but Lincoln could
not be sure of that. Like a conjuror, Jackson created a bogeyman out of an army
that in essence was laughably small.
You must take control over people's perceptions of you by playing with
appearances, mystifying and misleadi
