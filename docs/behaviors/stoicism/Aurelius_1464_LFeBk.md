introduction
On May 31, 1742, Francis Hutcheson in Glasgow sent to Thomas Drennan
in Belfast some copies of The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus. Newly translated from the Greek: With Notes, and an Account of
his Life (Glasgow: Printed by Robert Foulis and sold by him at the College:
1742).1
The letter that accompanied the dispatch of the books contained the
following intriguing account:
The bearer Mr. Hay takes over some copies of a new translation of An-
toninus, the greater half of which and more, was my amusementlastsum-
mer, for the sake of a singular worthy soul one Foulis;2 but I don’t let my
name appear in it, nor indeed have I told it to any here but the Man con-
cerned. I hope that you’ll like it; the rest was done by a very ingenious Lad
one Moore.3 Pray try your critical faculty in ﬁnding what parts I did &
what he did. I did not translate books in a suite, but I one or two, & he
one or two. I hope if you like it that it may sell pretty well with you about
Belfast I am sure it is doing a publick good to diffuse the Sentiments &
if you knew Foulis you would think he deserved all incouragement.4
1. The Meditations were reprinted in Glasgow by Robert and Andrew Foulis in 1749
(2nd ed.), 1752 (3rd ed.), and 1764 (4th ed.). Another “4th ed.” was printed in Dublin
for Robert Main in 1752.
2. Robert Foulis (1707–76) was appointed printer to the University of Glasgow in
1743. In partnership with his brother Andrew, he was responsible for the publication of
many attractive and accurate editions of classical texts.
3. James Moor (1712–79) was appointeduniversity librarianof theUniversityof Glas-
gow in 1742 and professor of Greek in 1746. He edited many of the classical texts pub-
lished by Robert and Andrew Foulis. Robert Foulis married Moor’s sister Elizabeth in
September 1742. Moor and the Foulis brothers witnessed Hutcheson’s will on June 30,
1746.

introduction
Hutcheson’s letter raises a number of questions: (1) Which booksof The
Meditations contain Hutcheson’s translations and notes and which books
should be attributed to Moor? (2) What considerations prompted Hutch-
eson to undertake this translation and edition, apart from his announced
desire to be of assistance to Robert Foulis and the Foulis press? (3) What
might be the signiﬁcance of Hutcheson’s notes to the text? Do they make
up a coherent set of ideas concerning human nature, morals, politics, and
religion? And what may be the relevance of these notes for our understand-
ing of his other writings? (4) Why was Hutcheson determined that his
name should not appear in the volume and that no one in Glasgow and its
environs apart from Foulis should know the identity of the persons re-
sponsible for the translation and the notes? (5) And, ﬁnally, what was the
signiﬁcance of Hutcheson’s adaptation of The Meditations fortheEnlight-
enment in Scotland?
1. Hutcheson and Moor:
The Division of Responsibility
There is a prima facie problem concerning the respective contributions of
Hutcheson and Moor to The Meditations. There arethreepiecesof external
evidence, and they do not agree. The ﬁrst is Hutcheson’s lettertoDrennan,
with his claim that he had done “the greater half . . . and more”; a claim
complicated by the circumstance that Hutcheson originally wrote “theﬁrst
half and more” and then struck through “ﬁrst” and substituted “greater.”
Clearly Hutcheson was reluctant to be speciﬁc and preferred to make a
game of it with Drennan. The second bit of evidence is found in TheFoulis
Catalogue of Books (Glasgow, 1777), where it is reported that the ﬁrst two
books were by James Moor and the remainder by Hutcheson.5 This record
of the matter has been accepted by many later scholars.6 It has the merit
of consistency with Hutcheson’s claim that he had done “one or two
books,” and Moor, “one or two”; and it leaves Hutcheson with responsi-

bility for the “greater half,” although not for the “ﬁrst” half, as he had orig-
inally written.
There is another account of the matter. Thomas Reid entered the fol-
lowing note in his own copy of the 1764 edition of The Meditations: “Dr.
Moor translated the 9th and 10th books. Dr. Francis Hutcheson the rest.
Dr. Hutcheson wrote the Preface and Dr. Moor collected [sic! ] the Proofs.
This information I had from Dr. Moor.”7 We believe that Reid’s note is the
most authoritative of the three versions of this matter. Books IX and X
differ from the other books. The style of the translation of books IX and
X lacks the characteristic ﬂow of Hutcheson’s prose. These two books also
contain a number of phrases not found elsewhere in the text. “Nature” or
“the nature of the whole” is referred to as “she” (for example, bk. IX, art. 1,
pp. 107–8)—the Greek phusis is a feminine noun—whereas elsewhere in
The Meditations nature is referred to as “it.”
In the notes for books IX and X thereareanumberof referencestoGreek
terminology and to Thomas Gataker’s translation of The Meditations from
the Greek into Latin. A preoccupation with the original Greek of Marcus
and with the quality of the translation by Gataker is not a conspicuous
feature of the notes found in the other books. It is a concern, however, that
might be expected of someone like Moor, who was renowned for the ac-
curacy of his command of ancient Greek. In every one of the other books
there are extensive notes that expand upon and interpret the philosophy of
the Stoics, with the exception of the ﬁrst book, which is concerned not
with ideas but with individuals who inﬂuenced Marcus (many of them
Stoics). The term Stoic is never used in books IX and X. Finally, in books
IX and X, there is an abundance of citations to writers of the New Testa-
ment: fourteen in all; twice as many as are found in the notes to all of the
other books combined. In light of these considerations, we conclude that
Reid’s record of his conversation with Moor may be taken as the most
authoritative of the three pieces of external evidence: books IX and X by
Moor; the rest by Hutcheson.

2. The Glasgow Edition in Context:
Other Editions and Inﬂuences
What prompted Hutcheson and Moor to undertake this translation and
edition of The Meditations? One of their expressed motivations was stylis-
tic. They were dissatisﬁed with the two translations then available in En-
glish. One was the translation by Meric Casaubon (1599–1671) published
in 1634,8 described by Hutcheson as “the old English translation”: it “can
scarce be agreeable to any reader; because of the intricate and antiquated
stile” (“Life of the Emperor,” p. 3). The other translation, published in
1701 (and reissued in 1714 and 1726), was by Jeremy Collier (1650–1726), a
nonjuring Anglican clergyman best known for his attack on the English
stage.9 This edition was described by Hutcheson as an exercise that “seems
not to preserve the grand simplicity of the original.” Hutcheson tells us
that his translation is “almost intirely new” and has been made “according
to Gataker’s edition of the original, and his Latin version” (“Life of the
Emperor,” p. 4). Thomas Gataker (1574–1654) was an Anglican clergyman
with Puritan sympathies, who maintained good relations with Presbyteri-
ans and was a member of the Westminster Assembly. Gataker’s edition of
The Meditations 10 in Greek, with a translation and commentary on thetext
in Latin, has been described by a modern classical scholar as “a monument
of vast and fastidious erudition,” which “has long been and will always
remain, the principal authority for any one undertaking to study or edit
the Meditations.” 11 An enlarged version was published in London in 1697,12
with a dedication by George Stanhope (1660–1728) to Lord John Somers
and a translation into Latin by Stanhope of a life of Marcus Aurelius,com-
posed in French, by Andre´ Dacier (1652–1722).
It is this 1697 edition of The Meditations that HutchesonandMoorused
as the basis for their edition. Hutcheson informs the reader that the “short
abstract” of the life of the emperor prefaced to his edition is “taken from

Himselfe.

the collections made by Dacier and Stanhope.” The “Maxims of the Sto-
ics,” appended to the Hutcheson and Moor edition, was excerpted from
Gataker’s “Praeloquium”:13 it had been included in the 1697 edition and,
in English translation, in the 1701 edition. An abbreviated version of the
1697 edition was published in Oxford in 1704, with emendations by R. I.
Oxoniensis (thought to be Richard Ibbetson).14 This edition, with the
Greek text and Latin translation by Gataker on facing pages, was repub-
lished by Robert and Andrew Foulis, in Glasgow, in 1744.15 It was one of
a dozen classical texts, published by the Foulis Press, that Hutcheson do-
nated to the University of St. Andrews in 1746.16
WhileMoor’s particulartalentwashismasteryof ancientGreek,Hutch-
eson was also sensitive to the challenge of translating the technical Stoic
vocabulary employed in The Meditations: such terms as hegemonikon (“rul-
ing principle”) and hypexairesis (“reserve clause”) were part of this vocab-
ulary.17 Hutcheson called attention to the difﬁculty of ﬁnding English
words that would convey the meaning of these terms. He translated he-
gemonikon as “the governing part,” and in a note to bk. IV, art. I, p. 47, he
wrote of the term hypexairesis: “The word here translated reservation, is a
noted one among the Stoics, often used in Epictetus, Arrian, and Simpli-
cius.” As Hutcheson explained it, the governing part of the mind may ex-
ercise a reservation upon desires for external things and then redirect the
mind to the pursuit of “our sole good,” which “is in our own affections,
purposes, and actions.”
It will also be evident that the language of Hutcheson’s translation re-
mains very much his own. A. S. L. Farquharson, the editor of The Medi-
13. In Jeremy Collier’s English translation (1726 ed., pp. 1–30) the title of Gataker’s
“Praeloquium” reads: “Gataker’s Preliminary Discourse, In which the Principles of the
Stoics are compared with the Peripateticks, with the Old Academicks, and more espe-
cially, the Epicurean Sect: The remaining Writings likewise of the Stoick Philosophers,
Seneca, Epictetus, and particularly those of our EmperourMarcusAntoninus,arebrieﬂy
examined.”

tations,18 renders the ﬁrst sentence of bk. II, art. 1, as follows: “I shall meet
today inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable
men.”19 Hutcheson translates the same sentence in his own idiom: “to day
I may have to do with some intermeddler in other mens affairs, with an
ungrateful man; an insolent, or a crafty, or an envious, or an unsociable
selﬁsh man” (p. 33).
As Hutcheson presents The Meditations, Marcus’s reﬂections are de-
signed to directly affect the sensibility of the reader and excite a desire to
contribute to the happiness of others. Marcus’s soliloquies, he tells us,
“contain some of the plainest, and yet most striking considerations, to af-
fect the hearts of those who have any sense of goodness”; they cannot fail
to inspire in us “a constant inﬂexible charity, andgood-willandcompassion
toward our fellows, superior to all the force of anger or envy, or our little
interfering worldly interests” (p. 3). Marcus’s language, in short, posed no
obstacle to Hutcheson’s discovering in The Meditations amoralphilosophy
very much congenial to and in harmony with his own. His reading of The
Meditations may alsohavebeeninﬂuencedbytherecognitionthatmoralists
whom he very much admired had discovered in the reﬂections of Marcus
Aurelius insights of great relevance for themselves.
Shaftesbury declared that he had discovered the proper meaning of sen-
sus communis, as that phrase had been used by Roman moralists and sati-
rists, in the notes and commentaries on The Meditations by Meric Casau-
bon and Thomas Gataker.20 It was in the glosses of those commentators
on the term translated by Hutcheson as “an unsociable, selﬁsh man” that
Shaftesbury recognized that sensus communis had been used by Juvenal,
Horace, and Seneca “to signify sense of public weal and of the common
interest, love of the community or society, natural affection, humanity,
obligingness, or that sort of civility which rises from a just sense of the
common rights of mankind, and the natural equality there is among those
of the same species.”21 In the same essay, Shaftesbury went on to account

for the origin of families, societies, clans, and tribes in a manner similar to
Marcus (bk. IX, art. 9, pp. 109–10). Shaftesbury did not draw the conclu-
sion formed by Marcus, however, that there is a universal happinessorgood
that all mankind may share. Instead, he thought that “Universal good, or
the interest of theworld in general,isakindof remotephilosophicalobject.
That greater community falls not easily under the eye.”22 In this respect,
Hutcheson’s concern for “universal happiness” has more in common, as
we shall see, with Marcus and with Stoic ideals. Shaftesbury elsewherecon-
sidered Marcus “one of the wisest and most serious of ancient authors.”23
And he cited sayings of Marcus, together with excerpts from the works of
Epictetus and Horace, to urge readers to withdraw their admiration and
desire from objects that are merely pleasurable and direct them instead to
“objects, whatever they are, of inward worth and beauty (such as honesty,
faith, integrity, friendship, honour).”24
Another moralist whom Hutcheson held in high regard, Henry More,
cited sayings of Marcus repeatedly throughout his handbook of morals,
Enchiridion ethicum.25 More was particularly impressed by Marcus’s con-
cept of the rational soul, of the idea that there is a divinity within us: “that
every Man’s Mind is a God, and had its Original from him”;26 that “in the
Judgment of that wisest Philosopher . . . to acquiesce in Nature’s common
Law, is . . . to obey the common Reason, that is in God; nay, which is little
less than God himself. For he is the living Law”;27 “that it was highly es-
timable to live benignly, and to practise Truth and Justice.”28 More, it may
be added, was attempting in these citations to reconcile Stoic and neo-
Platonicideasconcerningvirtuewithareadingof Aristotle’sethicsinwhich
Right Reason was ultimately nothing more than the promptings of an “In-
ward Sense.”29

introduction
Hutcheson’s earliest reference to the work of Marcus Aurelius appears
in An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections with
Illustrations on the Moral Sense (1728) in the course of a response to John
Clarke of Hull, who had argued, after Locke, that desire arises from the
need to relieve uneasiness of some kind. Hutcheson replied: “the noblest
Desire in our Nature, that of universal Happiness, is generally calm, and
wholly free from any confused uneasy Sensation: except, in some warm
Tempers, who, by a lively Imagination and frequent Attention to general
Ideas, raise something of Passion even toward universal Nature. . . . See
Marcus Aurelius, in many places.”30
A similar appeal to the reader to enlarge the scope of our desires was
made in A System of Moral Philosophy (1755, but composed in the 1730s),
in which Hutcheson explains the diversity of moral judgments by the ten-
dency to conﬁne moral approval to one’s own countrymen or, worse, to
members of one’s own party or sect or cabal. He proposes that “we enlarge
our views with truth and justice, and observe the structure of the human
soul, pretty much the same in all nations; . . . we must ﬁnd a sacred tye of
nature binding us even to foreigners, and a sense of that justice, mercy and
good-will which is due to all. . . . See this often inculcated in Marc.
Antonin.”31
Again, in A
