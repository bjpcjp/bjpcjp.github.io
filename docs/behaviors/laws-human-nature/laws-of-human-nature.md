# laws-of-human-nature

This book is just as full of life knowledge as his others, and even easier to apply to real life.
I didn’t like this book on initial read as much as Greene’s other books (and he’s one of my favourite
authors). It is dense and will be long to get through initially, but it will be worth it.
Full of lessons on psychology and strategy that will help you in work, relationships and life.
The Laws will make you more calm, and more strategic.
They will help you interpret the clues people constantly emit.
They will allow you to outthink the toxic people you encounter.
They will teach you how to motivate and influence people.
They will give you the power to alter your own negative patterns.
They will make you more empathetic.
They will help you see your own potential.
You are largely unaware of how deeply your emotions dominate you.
Rationality is the ability to counteract these emotional effects, to think instead of react, to open
your mind to what is really happening, as opposed to what you are feeling. It does not come
naturally; it is a power we must cultivate.
Keys to Human Nature
We can see the difference in the decisions and actions that people take and the results that
ensue. Rational people demonstrate over time that they are able to finish a project, to realize
their goals, to work effectively with a team, and to create something that lasts. Irrational people

reveal in their lives negative patterns—mistakes that keep repeating, unnecessary conflicts that
follow them wherever they go, dreams and projects that are never realized, anger and desires
for change that are never translated into concrete action.
There are three steps to begin on the path towards rationality.
Step One: Recognize the Biases
There are several you should be particularly aware of: confirmation bias, conviction bias,
appearance bias, group bias, blame bias, superiority bias.
Step Two: Beware the Inflaming Factors
Trigger points from childhood: look for childish intensity and out of character actions.
Sudden gains or losses: counter these with pessimism or optimism; we underestimate the role
of luck.
Rising pressure: people act differently under pressure.
Inflaming individuals: distance yourself from people who arouse extreme emotions in you.
Group effect: beware large groups, and keep close your ability to think for yourself.
Step Three: Strategies Toward Bringing Out the Rational Self
Know yourself thoroughly
Examine your emotions to their roots: dig below trigger points to see where they started.
Increase your reaction time: train yourself to step back.
Accept people as facts: see other people as phenomena, and avoid the emotional toll.
Find the optimal balance of thinking and emotion: maintain a balance between skepticism and
curiosity.
Love the rational: taming the emotional self will lead to calmness and clarity.
We all naturally possess the most remarkable tool for connecting to people and attaining social
power—empathy.
This instrument, however, is blunted by our habitual self-absorption. We are all narcissists,
some deeper on the spectrum than others.
Our mission in life is to come to terms with this self-love and learn how to turn our sensitivity
outward, toward others, instead of inward.
The Narcissistic Spectrum
We must be honest about our own nature and not deny it. We are all narcissists.
We need to develop our own empathy; to do this we need to develop 4 skills:
The empathetic attitude: you must begin with the assumption you are ignorant. Learn to be
curious about other people’s point of view.
Visceral empathy: pay attention to moods, as indicated by body language and tone of voice.
Mirroring people will also help draw out an empathetic response.
Analytic empathy: gather as much information about the early years of the people you are
studying and their relationship to their parents and siblings.
The empathetic skill: to work on this skill, keep several things in mind: The more people you
interact with in the flesh, the better you will get at this. And the greater the variety of people
you meet, the more versatile your skill will become.
People tend to wear the mask that shows them off in the best possible light—humble,
confident, diligent. They say the right things, smile, and seem interested in our ideas. They
learn to conceal their insecurities and envy.
If we take this appearance for reality, we never really know their true feelings, and on occasion
we are blindsided by their sudden resistance, hostility, and manipulative actions.
People continually leak out their true feelings and unconscious desires in the nonverbal cues
they cannot completely control—facial expressions, vocal inflections, tension in the body, and
nervous gestures.
You must master this language by transforming yourself into a superior reader of men and
women. 
On the other hand, since appearances are what people judge you by, you must learn how to
present the best front and play your role to maximum effect.
Keys to Human Nature
Your task as a student of human nature is twofold: First, you must understand and accept the
theatrical quality of life. You do not moralize and rail against the role-playing and the wearing
of masks so essential to smooth social functioning.
Second, you must not be naive and mistake people’s appearances for reality. You are not
blinded by people’s acting skills. You transform yourself into a master decoder of their true
feelings, working on your observation skills and practicing them as much as you can in daily life.
Observational Skills
Try and rediscover skills you had in your earlier years.
Start by trying to observe facial expressions that contradict what a person is saying.
Move on to voice afterwards, and then body language.
You can practice this on people you know, and also in public places.
Observe yourself too.
Everything people do is a gesture of some sort or another.
Decoding Keys
Your task is to look past the distractions and become aware of those signs that leak out
automatically, revealing something of the true emotion beneath the mask. The three categories
of the most important cues to observe and identify are dislike/like, dominance/submission, and
deception.
Dislike/Like Cues:
We often feel something isn’t right; we must learn to trust such intuitive responses and look for
signs.
People give out clear indications in their body language of active dislike or hostility. These
include the sudden squinting of the eyes at something you have said, the glare, the pursing of
the lips until they nearly disappear, the stiff neck, the torso or feet that turn away from you
while you are still engaged in a conversation, the folding of the arms as you try to make a point,
and an overall tenseness in the body.
A good way to gauge subtler body language is how someone behaves towards you versus
others.
When people start to feel comfortable in your presence, they will stand closer to you or lean in,
their arms not folded or revealing any tension. If you are giving a talk or telling a story, frequent
head nods, attentive gazes, and genuine smiles will indicate that people agree with what you
are saying and are losing their resistance. They exchange more looks. Perhaps the best and
most exciting sign of all is synchrony, the other person unconsciously mirroring you.
You can also train yourself to not only monitor these changes that show your influence but
induce them as well by displaying positive cues yourself. You begin to slowly stand or lean
closer, revealing subtle signs of openness. You nod and smile as others talk. You mirror their
behavior and their breathing patterns.
Dominance/Submission Cues:
Confidence usually comes with a greater feeling of relaxation that is clearly reflected in the face,
and with a greater freedom of movement. Those who are powerful will feel allowed to look
around more at others, choosing to make eye contact with whomever they please.
Their eyelids are more closed, a sign of seriousness and competence. If they feel bored or
annoyed, they show it more freely and openly. They often smile less, frequent smiling being a
sign of overall insecurity.
They feel more entitled to touch people, such as with friendly pats on the back or on the arm.
They stand taller, and their gestures are relaxed and comfortable. Most important, others feel
compelled to imitate their style and mannerisms.
For deception, the best we can do is to learn to recognize certain telltale signs of an attempt at
deception and maintain our skepticism as we examine the evidence further.
The most clear and common sign comes when people assume an extra-animated front.
Similarly, if people are trying to cover something up, they tend to become extra vehement,
righteous, and chatty. They are playing on the conviction bias.
In both cases—the cover-up and the soft sell—the deceiver is striving to distract you from the
truth.
With such deceivers you will often notice that one part of the face or the body is more
expressive to attract your attention. This will often be the area around the mouth, with large
smiles and changing expressions. This is the easiest area of the body for people to manipulate
and create an animated effect. But it could also be exaggerated gestures with the hands and
arms.
The key is that you will detect tension and anxiety in other parts of the body, because it is
impossible for them to control all of the muscles.
The Art of Impression Management
Master the nonverbal cues: radiate confidence, flash genuine smiles, mirror the people you deal
with.
Be a method actor: learn how to consciously put yourself in the right emotional mood.
Adapt to your audience: shape your nonverbal cues to audience style and taste.
Create the proper first impression: give extra attention to your first appearance before and
individual or group.
Use dramatic effects: make your appearances and behavior less predictable.
Project saintly qualities: show yourself as progressive, supremely tolerant and open-minded.
When choosing people to work and associate with, do not be mesmerized by their reputation or
taken in by the surface image they try to project. Instead, train yourself to look deep within
them and see their character.
Gauge the relative strength of their character by how well they handle adversity, their ability to
adapt and work with other people, their patience and ability to learn.
A person of strong character is like gold—rare but invaluable. They can adapt, learn, and
improve themselves.
Keys to Human Nature
Character, then, is something that is so deeply ingrained or stamped within us that it compels
us to act in certain ways, beyond our awareness and control. We can conceive of this character
as having three essential components, each layered on top of the other, giving this character
depth.
The first comes from genetics. The second, our early years and the attachments we formed. The
third is from our habits and experiences as we get older. 
First, we must understand our own character, and find the negative patterns that you can see
recurring in your life.
Second, we must develop our skill in reading the character of people we deal with.
Character Signs
The most significant indicator of people’s character comes through their actions over time.
At times of stress or crisis is when flaws become apparent, and similarly, how people handle
power and responsibility.
Note that extroverts and introverts will have different characteristics, and you must recognize
those to categorize them and judge their character correctly.
It is critical that you measure the relative strength of someone’s character as well.
The strength emanates from a feeling of personal security and self-worth. This allows such
people to take criticism and learn from their experiences. This means they do not give up so
easily, since they want to learn how to get better. They are rigorously persistent. People of
strong character are open to new ideas and ways of doing things without compromising the
basic principles they adhere to. In adversity they can retain their presence of mind. They can
handle chaos and the unpredictable without succumbing to anxiety. They keep their word. They
have patience, can organize a lot of material, and complete what they start. Not continually
insecure about their status, they can also subsume their personal interests to the good of the
group, knowing that what works best for the team will in the end make their life easier and
better.
Toxic Types
In general, you must learn to identify toxic character, and to not get involved or disengage as quickly
as possible.
The Hyperperfectionist: patterns of initial success followed by burnout and spectacular
failures.
The Relentless Rebel: initially seem exciting, but are locked in adolescence.
The Personalizer: seem sensitive and thoughtful, but take everything personally.
The Drama Magnet: they are exciting to be around, but will eventually cause ugly drama.
The Big Talker: they have big ideas, and are looking for help and backers, but can be afraid of
actually implementing them.
The Sexualizer: they seem charged with sexual energy, but will blend the boundaries of when
this is appropriate.
The Pampered Prince/Princess: they seem calm and confident and with a regal air, but will
cause others to feel guilty for not attending to them.
The Savior: they will save you from your difficulties and troubles; it is better to become self-
reliant.
The Easy Moralizer: they communicate a sense of injustice at this or that, but have a secret
side with flaws.
The Superior Character
You can go in one of two directions: ignorance and denial, or examining yourself as thoroughly
as possible.
The result of denial is simple: the compulsive behavior and the patterns become even more set
into place.
The other direction is harder to take, but it is the only path that leads to true power and the
formation of a superior character. It works in the following manner: You examine yourself as
thoroughly as possible. You look at the deepest layers of your character, determining whether
you are an introvert or extrovert, whether you tend to be governed by high levels of anxiety and
sensitivity, or hostility and anger, or a profound need to engage with people. You look at your
primal inclinations—those subjects and activities you are naturally drawn to. You examine the
quality of attachments you formed with your parents, looking at your current relationships as
the best sign of this. You look with rigorous honesty at your own mistakes and the patterns that
continually hold you back. You know your limitations—those situations in which you do not do
your best. You also become aware of the natural strengths in your character that have survived
past adolescence.
Now, with this awareness, you are no longer the captive of your character, compelled to
endlessly repeat the same strategies and mistakes. As you see yourself falling into one of your
usual patterns, you can catch yourself in time and step back. You may not be able to completely
eliminate such patterns, but with practice you can mitigate their effects. Knowing your
limitations, you will not try your hand at things for which you have no capacity or inclination.
Finally, you need to also refine or cultivate those traits that go into a strong character—
resilience under pressure, attention to detail, the ability to complete things, to work with a
team, to be tolerant of people’s differences. The only way to do so is to work on your habits,
which go into the slow formation of your character. For instance, you train yourself to not react
in the moment by repeatedly placing yourself in stressful or adverse situations in order to get
used to them.
Absence and presence have very primal effects upon us. Too much presence suffocates; a
degree of absence spurs our interest.
We are marked by the continual desire to possess what we do not have—the object projected
by our fantasies.
Learn to create some mystery around you, to use strategic absence to make people desire your
return, to want to possess you. Dangle in front of others what they are missing most in life,
what they are forbidden to have, and they will go crazy with desire.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Overcome this weakness in yourself
by embracing your circumstances, your fate.
The Object of Desire
Instead of focusing on what you want and covet in the world, you must train yourself to focus
on others, on their repressed desires and unmet fantasies.
People do not want truth and honesty, no matter how much we hear such nonsense endlessly
repeated. They want their imaginations to be stimulated and to be taken beyond their banal
circumstances. They want fantasy and objects of desire to covet and grope after. Create an air
of mystery around you and your work. Associate it with something new, unfamiliar, exotic,
progressive, and taboo.
Do not define your message but leave it vague. Create an illusion of ubiquity—your object is
seen everywhere and desired by others.
Keys to Human Nature
By nature, we humans are not easily contented with our circumstances. By some perverse force
within us, the moment we possess something or get what we want, our minds begin to drift
toward something new and different, to imagine we can have better.
More and more people have come to believe that others should simply desire them for who
they are. This means revealing as much as they can about themselves, exposing all of their likes
and dislikes, and making themselves as familiar as possible. They leave no room for
imagination or fantasy.
Understand: People may point to all of this as evidence that we humans are becoming more
honest and truthful, but human nature does not change within a few generations. People have
become more obvious and forthright not out of some deep moral calling but out of increasing
self-absorption and overall laziness. It requires no effort to simply be oneself or to blast one’s
message.
Do not swallow the easy moralism of the day, which urges honesty at the expense of
desirability. Go in the opposite direction. With so few people out there who understand the art
of desirability, it affords you endless opportunities to shine and exploit people’s repressed
fantasies.
Strategies for Stimulating Desire
Know how and when to withdraw.
Your presence should have a bit of coldness to it, as if you could do without others.
Add to this a bit of blankness and amiguity as to who you are. Your opinions, values, and tastes
are never too obvious to people.
With the work you produce you can create similar covetous effects. Always leave the
presentation and the message relatively open-ended.
Create rivalries of desire. 
If you can somehow create the impression that others desire you or your work, you will pull
people into your current without having to say a word or impose yourself.
Use induction. 
Associate your object with something ever so slightly illicit, unconventional, or politically
advanced.
Incorporate desire by giving the impression you are revealing secrets that should really not be
shared.
It is not possession but desire that secretly impels people.
The Supreme Desire
In general, do not constantly wait and hope for something better, but rather make the most of
what you have.
In the end what you really must covet is a deeper relationship to reality, which will bring you
calmness, focus, and practical powers to alter what it is possible to alter.
It is in the animal part of your nature to be most impressed by what you can see and hear in the
present—the latest news reports and trends, the opinions and actions of the people around
you, whatever seems the most dramatic.
Learn to measure people by the narrowness or breadth of their vision
