Steal from the Poor, Give to the Rich
 
WHETHER YOU’RE TAKING CHARGE OF THE OTTOMAN Empire, a corporation, or Liberia, controlling the flow of funds is essential to buying support.
However once you’ve emptied the state’s or the corporate coffers by buying off both your essential supporters and their replacements, if necessary, you
must reckon with the entirely new challenge of refilling the treasury. If a leader cannot find a reliable source of income, then it is only a matter of time until
someone else will offer his supporters greater rewards than he can.
Money is essential for anyone who wants to run any organization. Without their share of the state’s rewards, hardly anyone will stick with an incumbent
for long. Liberia’s Prince Johnson knew this when he tortured Samuel Doe, demanding the number of the bank accounts where the state’s treasure had
been hidden. Without getting his question answered, Johnson would not be able to secure power for himself. In fact, neither he nor rival insurgent Charles
Taylor could secure state revenue enough to buy control of Liberia’s government immediately after Doe was overthrown. The upshot: Samuel Doe died
under Prince Johnson’s torture without answering the question, and Liberia degenerated into civil war. Each faction was able to extract enough resources
to buy support in a small region, but no one could control the state as a whole.
The succession process in the Ottoman Empire is another illustration of the same point. Upon the death of their father, the Ottoman princes rushed from
their provinces to secure the treasury, buy the loyalty of the army and have all their potential rivals (also known as brothers) strangled. Whoever first
secured control over the money was likely to win. If no one son triumphed, cleanly wresting the treasury out of his siblings’ control, then no one could
summon up the necessary revenues to pay his backers. The common result, as in Liberia, was civil war.
“Knowing where the money is” is particularly important in autocracies—and particularly difficult. Such systems are shrouded in secrecy. Supporters
must be paid but there are no accurate accounts detailing stocks and flows of wealth. Of course, this lack of transparency is by design.1 Thus does
chaotic bookkeeping become a kind of insurance policy: it becomes vastly more difficult for a rival to promise to pay supporters if he cannot match
existing bribes, or, for that matter, put his hands on the money. Indeed, secrecy not only provides insurance against rivals, it also keeps supporters in the
dark about what other supporters are getting. Anyone who has tried to read the annual reports of publicly traded firms will quickly realize that this is a
practice induced by dependence on a small winning coalition. In the corporate setting opacity occurs despite having to satisfy strict regulations and
accounting standards. Secrecy ensures that everyone gets the deal they can negotiate, not knowing how much it might cost to replace them. Thus every
supporter’s price is kept as low as possible, and woe to any supporter who is discovered trying to coordinate with his fellow coalition members to raise
their price.
As we saw at the end of the last chapter, it is very difficult for autocrats to survive their early months in office. Good governance is a luxury they cannot
afford at a time when they must scramble to find revenues. Little surprise, then, that we so often see looting, confiscations, extraction, and fire sales during
political transitions, or conversely, and perhaps ironically, temporary liberal reforms by would-be dictators who are mindful that it is easier for a public
goods–producing democrat than an autocrat to survive the first months in office. Thus it is that in the immediate aftermath of a leadership transition we
see a few new leaders acting as if they care about the people and many new leaders seizing the people’s wealth and property. Such confiscations of
property might well damage long-run revenue, but if a leader does not find money in the short term then the long run is someone else’s problem.
Democrats are generally fortunate enough to know where most of the money is. When David Cameron became prime minister of Britain or Barack
Obama became president of the United States, neither needed to torture their predecessor to find the money. Because democracies have well-
organized and relatively transparent treasuries, their flow of funds is left undisturbed by leader turnover. There are two reasons for this transparency. First,
as we are about to explore, democratic leaders best promote their survival through policies of open government. Second, a larger proportion of revenue
in democracies than in autocracies tends to be from the taxation of people at work. Such taxes need to be levied in a clear and transparent way, because
just as surely as leaders need money, their constituents want to avoid taxes.
Taxation
 
We all hate taxes and are impressively inventive in looking for ways to avoid them. Leaders, however, are rather fond of taxes—as long as they don’t have
to pay them. Being a dictator can be a terrific job, but it also can be terribly stressful, especially if money is in short supply. Taxes are one of the great
antidotes to stress for heads of governments. Taxes, after all, generate much-needed revenue, which can then reward supporters. As a general principle
leaders always want to increase taxes. That gives them more resources with which to reward their backers and, not to be forgotten, themselves.
Nevertheless, they will find it difficult to raise taxes with impunity.
Leaders face three constraints on how much money they can skim from their subjects. First, taxes diminish how hard people work. Second, some of the
tax burden inevitably will fall upon the essential backers of the leader. (In general, the first constraint limits taxes in autocracies and the second constraint
sets the boundary on taxes in democracies.) The third consideration is that tax collection requires both expertise and resources. The costs associated
with collecting taxes limit what leaders can extract and shapes the choice of taxation methods.
The first and most common complaint about taxes is that they discourage hard work, enterprise, and investment. This is true. People are unlikely to
work as hard to put money in government coffers as they do to put money in their own pocket. Economists often like to express taxation and economic
activity in terms of pies—when taxes are low, they say, the people work hard to enlarge the pie, but the government only gets a thin slice of the pie. As the
government increases taxes, its share of the pie increases but people begin to do less work so the overall size of the pie shrinks. If the government sets
tax rates to be extremely low or extremely high, its take will approach zero. In the first case it gets very little of a large pie; in the latter case there is hardly
any pie because hardly anyone works. Somewhere between these extremes there is an ideal tax rate that produces the most revenue the state can get
from taxation. What that ideal rate is depends on the precise size of the winning coalition. That, in fact, is one of many reasons that it is more helpful to talk
about organizations in terms of how many essentials they depend on than to talk about imprecise notions such as autocracy or democracy. The general
rule is that the larger the group of essentials, the lower the tax rate. Having said that, we return to the less precise vocabulary of autocracy and democracy,
but always mindful that we really mean smaller or bigger coalitions.
Autocrats aim for the rate that maximizes revenue. They want as much money as possible for themselves and their cronies. In contrast, good
governance dictates that taxes should only be taken to pay for things that the market is poor at providing, such as national defense and large infrastructure
projects. Taking relatively little in taxes therefore encourages the people to lead more productive lives, creating a bigger pie. Democrats are closer to this
good governance ideal than autocrats, but they too overtax. The centerpiece of Reaganomics, the economic plan of US president Ronald Reagan (1981–
1989), was that US taxes were actually higher than this revenue maximizing level. By reducing taxes, he argued, people would do so much extra work that
government revenue would actually go up. That is, a smaller share of a bigger pie would be larger than the bigger share of a smaller pie. Such a win-win
policy proved popular, which is why similar appeals are again in vogue. Of course, it did not quite work out this way in fact.
To a certain extent, Reagan was right: lower taxes encouraged people to work and so the pie grew. However, crucially, in democracies it is the
coalition’s willingness to bear taxes that is the true constraint on the tax level. Since taxes had not been so high as to squash entrepreneurial zeal in the
first place, there wasn’t much appreciable change as a result of Reagan’s tax cuts. The pie grew a little, but not by so much that revenues went up.
Today, the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party seeks to reenact tax-cutting policies similar to Reagan’s. Like him, they argue that tax cuts will grow
the economy. The lesson from the Tea Party movement’s electoral success in 2010 is that people don’t like paying taxes. Politician who raise or even
maintain current taxes are politically vulnerable, but then so too are politicians who fail to deliver the policies their coalition wants. Herein lies the rub. It
may well be that cutting taxes, while increasing the size of the economic pie, fails to make it big enough to generate both more wealth and more effective
government policies. The question is and always must be the degree to which the private sector’s efficient but unequal distribution of wealth trumps
government’s more equitable, less efficient, but popular economic programs.
Ruling is about staying in power, not about good governance. To this end, leaders buy support by rewarding their essential backers relative to others.
Taxation plays a dual role in generating this kind of loyalty. First it provides leaders with the resources to enrich their most essential supporters. Second, it
reduces the welfare of those outside of the coalition. Taxation, especially in small-coalition settings, redistributes from those outside the coalition (the
poor) to those inside the coalition (the rich). Small coalition systems amply demonstrate this principle, for these are places where people are rich
precisely because they are in the winning coalition, and others are poor because they are not. Phillip Chiyangwa, a protégé of Robert Mugabe in
Zimbabwe, has stated it bluntly, “I am rich because I belong to Zanu-PF [Mugabe’s ruling party].”2 When the coalition changes, so does who is rich and
who is poor.
Nor is Zimbabwe an isolated case. Robert Bates, a professor of government at Harvard University, described the link between wealth and political
backing in Kenya:
I recall working in western Kenya shortly after Daniel Arap Moi succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as President of Kenya. With the shift in power, the political
fortunes of elite politicians had changed. As I drove through the highlands, I encountered boldly lettered signs posted on the gateways of farms
announcing the auction of cattle, farm machinery, and buildings and lands. Once they were no longer in favor, politicians found their loans cancelled
or called in, their subsidies withdrawn, or their lines of business, which had once been sheltered by the state, exposed to competition. Some whom I
had once seen in the hotels of Nairobi, looking sleek and satisfied, I now encountered in rural bars, looking lean and apprehensive, as they
contemplated the magnitude of their reversal.3
 
Needless to say, people want to be sleek and satisfied and not lean and apprehensive. That is why they remain loyal. A heavy tax burden emphasizes
the differences between being rich and poor—in or out of the coalition. At the same time, the resulting revenues fund spoils for the lucky few, leaving little
for everyone else. Further, the misery such heavy taxes inflict on the general population makes participation in the coalition even more valuable. Fearing
exclusion and poverty under an alternative leadership, supporters are all the more fiercely loyal. They will do anything to keep what they have and keep on
collecting goodies. Gerard Padró i Miguel of the London School of Economics has shown that the leaders of numerous African nations tax “too” highly
(that is, beyond the maximum revenue point) and then turn around and provide subsidies to chosen groups. This may be economic madness, but it is also
political genius.4
Democrats tax heavily too and for the same reason as autocrats: they provide subsidies to groups that favor them at the polls at the expense of those
who oppose them. We will see, for instance, that Democrats and Republicans each use taxation when they can to redistribute wealth from their opponents
to their supporters. So democratic governments also have an appetite for taxation but they cannot indulge that appetite to the extent autocrats can. Since
their numbers are small, an autocrat can easily compensate his essential backers for the tax burden that falls on them. This option is not available to a
democrat because his number of supporters is so large. Tax rates are therefore limited by the need to make coalition members better off than they can
expect to be under alternative leadership. On the campaign trail, US president George H. W. Bush told the American people, “Read my lips, no new
taxes.” Yet, budget shortfalls left him scrambling for revenue. The result was more taxes. In the wake of the First Gulf War, just eighteen months earlier,
Bush had approval ratings of over 90 percent. But a declining economy and his broken promise on taxes led to his ouster in the 1992 election. While all
leaders want to generate revenue with which to reward supporters, democratic incumbents are constrained to keep taxes relatively low. A democrat taxes
above the good governance minimum, but he does not raise taxes to the autocrat’s revenue maximization point.
The relationship between regime type and taxation can be seen in the recent history of Mexico. Mexico’s first free election came in 1994, and the
incumbent party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), lost nationally for the first time in 2000. As can be seen in Figure 4.1, onset of competitive
elections (and of democratization) marks the start of the decline in government revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). As the size of
the winning coalition enlarged, Mexico’s tax rates followed suit by declining, just as they should when politicians need to curry favor with many instead of a
few. For instance, the highest marginal tax rate in Mexico in 1979, with the PRI firmly in control, was 55 percent. As the PRI’s one-party rule declined, so
did tax rates. By 2000, marking the first truly free, competitive presidential election, Mexico’s highest tax rate was 40 percent.5
Members of any autocrat’s small coalition also dislike paying taxes, but they readily endorse high taxes when those taxes are used to funnel great
wealth back to them. This was just the case in Bell, California. City Manager Robert Rizzo raised property taxes. The city council could have stopped such
increases, but had they done so, the city could not have afforded their bloated consultancy fees. Suppose for simplicity that Rizzo’s coalition was
composed of 1 percent of Bell’s 36,000 residents. For every dollar increase in tax per person, Rizzo would have had up to $100 of services and
payments he could transfer to each coalition member. Had his coalition been composed of half of Bell’s residents, each dollar increase in tax would
provide only $2 per coalition member for transfers and services. It is easy to see why the coalition would sooner endorse higher taxes in the former setup
than the latter.
 
FIGURE 4.1 Mexico’s Tax Take and Democratization
Nevertheless, to most of us who live in democracies, the idea that our taxes are actually less than in other systems might sound frankly absurd. If you
live in New York City, as we do, you pay federal, state, and local taxes (as well as social security, Medicare, and sales tax). If you earn a reasonably good
income, then income taxes suck up about 40 percent of your earnings. By the time you factor in sales, property, and other taxes, a reasonably wealthy
New Yorker will have paid more than half her income in tax—hardly a low figure. European democracies, with their extensive social safety nets and
universal health care, can tax at even higher rates. In contrast, some autocracies don’t even have income taxes. But the comparison of average tax rates
is misleading.
At the income levels taxed in much of the world’s poor autocracies, the tax rate in Europe and the United States is zero. We have to compare taxes at
given income levels, not across the board, since most income tax systems are designed to be progressive, taxing higher incomes at higher rates than
lower incomes. By looking at how much tax has to be paid at a given income level across countries we get close to comparing apples to apples and
oranges to oranges. In the United States, for example, a couple with one child and an income under about $32,400 pays no income tax. If their income
were, say, $20,000 they would receive $1,000 from the federal government to help support their child. In China, a family with an income of $32,400 is
expected to pay about $6,725 in income tax.6 Further, even when nominal rates are low, autocracies have high implicit taxes—if you have something
valuable then it simply gets taken.7 It’s worth remembering that the wealthiest man in China and the wealthiest man in Russia are both currently in prison.
In 2004, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was the wealthiest man in Russia and the sixteenth wealthiest man in the world. He made his money building up Yukos,
an oil company founded in the privatization wave in Russia in 1993. Yukos was the largest nonstate oil company in the world and accounted for about 20
percent of Russian oil production. Khodorkovsky, who had initially been close to the government, spoke out about Putin’s autocratic rule of Russia and he
funded several opposition political parties. In 2003, he was arrested on fraud charges and subsequently convicted. The Russian government accused
Yukos of tax evasion. According to Yukos, the tax take claimed by Russia from Yukos was substantially higher than that levied on other oil companies and,
in some years, exceeded gross revenue. These enormous tax burdens forced Yukos into bankruptcy. With the end of his first eight-year sentence,
Khodorkovsky, apparently still seen as a liability by the Russian government, was recently given a second sentence for embezzlement and money
laundering.
His Chinese counterpart, Huang Guangyu, also known as Wong Kwong Ku, fared little better. Starting with nothing but $500 and a street cart, Guangyu
created Gome, the largest electrical retailer in China. He was repeatedly ranked as China’s richest individual—until he was sentenced to fourteen years
in prison for bribery. It is likely that he was guilty since bribery is commonplace in Chinese business dealings. It is also likely that he and others who have
been prosecuted for corruption in China were “chosen for political reasons.”8
In autocracies, it is unwise to be rich unless it is the government that made you rich. And if this is the case, it is important to be loyal beyond all else. As
we noted, it is quite possible that Guangyu and Khodorkovsky were both guilty of fraud and bribery. That is the nature of business in their respective
countries. Even so, many others were surely guilty of the same crimes and yet walk free today. What singled them out was that they did not support the
government and
