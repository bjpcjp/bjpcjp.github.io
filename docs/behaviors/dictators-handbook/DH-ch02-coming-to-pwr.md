Coming to Power
 
FOR CENTURIES, “JOHN DOE” HAS SERVED AS THE placeholder name assigned to unidentified nobodies. And while his first name may have been
Samuel, not John, in every other respect Liberia’s Sergeant Doe was just such a nobody until April 12, 1980. Born in a remote part of Liberia’s interior
and virtually illiterate, he, like hundreds of thousands of others in his predicament, moved out of the West African jungle in search of work. He headed to
the capital city, Monrovia, where he found that the army held great opportunities even for men, like him, who had no skills. One of these opportunities
presented itself when Doe found himself in President William Tolbert’s bedroom on April 12. As the president slept, he seized the day, bayoneted the
president, threw his entrails to the dogs, and declared himself Liberia’s new president.1 Thus did he rise from obscurity to claim the highest office in his
land.
Together with sixteen other noncommissioned officers, Doe had scaled the fence at the Executive Mansion, hoping to confront the president and find
out why they had not been paid. Seeing the opportunity before him, he ended the dominance of Tolbert’s True Whig Party, a political regime created by
slaves repatriated from America in 1847. He immediately rounded up thirteen cabinet ministers, who were then publically executed on the beach in front
of cheering crowds. Many more deaths would follow. Doe then headed the People’s Redemption Council that suspended the constitution and banned all
political activity.
Doe had no idea what a president was supposed to do and even less idea of how to govern a country. What he did know was how to seize power and
keep it: remove the previous ruler; find the money; form a small coalition; and pay them just enough to keep them loyal. In short order, he proceeded to
replace virtually everyone who had been in the government or the army with members of his own small Krahn tribe, which made up only about 4 percent of
the population. He increased the pay of army privates from $85 to $250 per month. He purged everyone he did not trust. Following secret trials, he had no
fewer than fifty of his original collaborators executed.
Doe funded his government, as his predecessors had, with revenues from Firestone, which leased large tracts of land for rubber; from the Liberian Iron
Mining Company, which exported iron ore; and by registering more than 2,500 ocean-going ships without requiring safety inspections. Further, he
received direct financial backing from the United States government. The United States gave Doe’s government $500 million over ten years. In exchange
the United States received basing rights and made Liberia a center for US intelligence and propaganda. It is believed that Doe and his cronies
personally amassed $300 million.
As for Doe’s policies, they couldn’t be called successful. Indeed he produced virtually no policies at all. He was lazy, and spent his days hanging out
with the wives of his presidential guards. The economy collapsed, foreign debt soared, and criminal enterprises became virtually the only successful
businesses in Liberia. Monrovian banks became money-laundering operations. Little wonder that the people of Liberia ended up hating Doe. And yet,
provided he knew where the money was and who needed paying off, he managed to survive in power.
Damn the idea of good governance and don’t elevate the concerns of the people over your own and those of your supporters: That’s a good mantra for
would-be dictators. In such a way any John Doe—even a Samuel Doe—can seize power, and even keep it.
Paths to Power with Few Essentials
 
To come to power a challenger need only do three things. First, he must remove the incumbent. Second, he needs to seize the apparatus of government.
Third, he needs to form a coalition of supporters sufficient to sustain him as the new incumbent. Each of these actions involves its own unique challenges.
The relative ease with which they can be accomplished differs between democracies and autocracies.
There are three ways to remove an incumbent leader. The first, and easiest, is for the leader to die. If that convenience does not offer itself, a challenger
can make an offer to the essential members of the incumbent’s coalition that is sufficiently attractive that they defect to the challenger’s cause. Third, the
current political system can be overwhelmed from the outside, whether by military defeat by a foreign power, or through revolution and rebellion, in which
the masses rise up, depose the current leader, and destroy existing institutions.
While rebellion requires skill and coordination, its success ultimately depends heavily upon coalition loyalty, or more precisely, the absence of loyalty to
the old regime. Hosni Mubarak’s defeat by a mass uprising in Egypt is a case in point. The most critical factor behind Mubarak’s defeat in February 2011
was the decision by Egypt’s top generals to allow demonstrators to take to the streets without fear of military suppression. And why was that the case? As
explained in a talk given on May 5, 2010, based on the logic set out here, cuts in US foreign aid to Egypt combined with serious economic constraints
that produced high unemployment, meant that Mubarak’s coalition was likely to be underpaid and the people were likely to believe the risks and costs of
rebellion were smaller than normal.2 That is, the general rule of thumb for rebellion is that revolutions occur when those who preserve the current system
are sufficiently dissatisfied with their rewards that they are willing to look for someone new to take care of them. On the other hand, revolts are defeated
through suppression of the people—always an unpleasant task—so coalition members need to receive enough benefits from their leader that they are
willing to do horribly distasteful things to ensure that the existing system is maintained. If they do not get enough goodies under the current system, then
they will not stop the people from rising up against the regime.
Speed Is Essential
 
Once the old leader is gone, it is essential to seize the instruments of power, such as the treasury, as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in
small coalition systems. Anyone who waits will be a loser in the competition for power.
Speed is of the essence. The coalition size in most political systems is much smaller than a majority of the selectorate. Furthermore, even though we
tend to think that if one leader has enough votes or supporters, then the other potential candidate must be short, this is wrong. There can simultaneously
be many different groups trying to organize to overthrow a regime and each might have sufficient numbers of lukewarm or double-dealing supporters who
could aid them in securing power—or just as easily aid someone else, if the price is right. This is why it is absolutely essential to seize the reins of power
quickly to make sure that your group gets to control the instruments of the state, and not someone else’s.
Samuel Doe ruled because his group had the guns. He did not need half the nation to support him. He needed just enough confederates so that he
could control the army and suppress the rest of the population. There were many other coalitions that could have formed, but Doe grabbed hold of power
first and suppressed the rest. This is the essence of coming to power.
Consider a room filled with 100 people. Anyone could take complete control if only she had five supporters with automatic weapons pointed at the rest.
She would remain in power so long as the five gunmen continue to back her. But there need be nothing special about her or about the gunmen beyond the
fact that they grabbed the guns first. Had someone else secured the guns and given them to five supporters of their own, then it would be someone else
telling everyone what to do.
Waiting is risky business. There is no prize for coming in second.
Pay to Play
 
Paying supporters, not good governance or representing the general will, is the essence of ruling. Buying loyalty is particularly difficult when a leader first
comes to power. When deciding whether to support a new leader, prudent backers must not only think about how much their leader gives them today.
They must also ponder what they can expect to receive in the future.
The supporting cast in any upstart’s transitional coalition must recognize that they might not be kept on for long. After Doe took over the Liberian
government, he greatly increased army salaries. This made it immediately attractive for his fellow army buddies to back him. But they were mindful that
they might not be rewarded forever. Don’t forget that fifty of his initial backers ended up executed.
Allaying supporters’ fears of being abandoned is a key element of coming to power. Of course, supporters are not so naïve that they will be convinced
by political promises that their position in the coalition is secure. But such political promises are much better than tipping your hand as to your true plans.
Once word gets out that supporters are going to be replaced, they will turn on their patron. For instance, Ronald Reagan won the pro-choice vote in the
1980 US presidential election over the pro-life incumbent, Jimmy Carter. When Reagan’s true abortion stance became apparent, the pro-choice voters
abandoned him in droves. Walter Mondale won the pro-choice vote in the 1984 presidential election despite Reagan’s reelection in a landslide.
Leaders understand the conditions that can cost them their heads. That is why they do their level best to pay essential cronies enough that these
partners really want to stay loyal. This makes it tough for someone new to come to power. But sometimes circumstances conspire to open the door to a
new ruler.
Mortality: The Best Opportunity for Power
 
Most unavoidably, and therefore first, on the list of risks of being deposed is the simple, inescapable fact of mortality. Dead leaders cannot deliver
rewards to their coalition. Dying leaders face almost as grave a problem. If essential backers know their leader is dying, then they also know that they
need someone new to assure the flow of revenue into their pockets. That’s a good reason to keep terminal illnesses secret since a terminal ailment is
bound to provoke an uprising, either within the ranks of the essential coalition or among outsiders who see an opportunity to step in and take control of the
palace.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran and Corazon Aquino in the Philippines both chose the right time to seize power. Take the case of Ayatollah
Khomeini. He was one of the most senior Shia clerics in Iran and a vehement opponent of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s secular regime. During early
1960 he spoke out against the regime, and organized protests. His activities resulted in his being repeatedly arrested. In 1964, he went into exile, first to
Turkey, then Iraq, and eventually to France, continuing to preach his opposition to the shah wherever he was. Tapes of his speeches were popular
throughout Iran.
In 1977, with the death of the shah’s rival, Ali Shariati, Khomeini became the most influential opposition leader. Although he urged others to oppose the
shah, he refused to return to Iran until the shah was gone. Except for a privileged few, almost everyone in Iran hungered for change. The shah’s regime
and those associated with it were widely disliked. Seeing that there was a chance for real change, people threw their support behind the one clearly
viable alternative: Khomeini. After the shah fled the country, an estimated 6 million people turned out to cheer Khomeini’s return. Judging from what he did
next, they may have cheered too soon.
Immediately after his return, Khomeini challenged the interim government, which was headed by the shah’s former prime minister. Much of the army
defected and joined Khomeini, and when he ordered a jihad against soldiers remaining loyal to the old regime resistance collapsed. Then he ordered a
referendum to be held in which the people would choose between the old monarchy of the shah or an Islamic republic. With the endorsement of 98
percent for the latter, he rewrote the constitution basing it on rule by clerics. After some dubious electoral practices this constitution was approved and he
became the Supreme Leader with a Council of Guardians to veto non-Islamic laws and candidates. The many secular and moderate religious groups
who had taken to the streets on his behalf, providing the critical support needed for his rise to power, found they were left out, excluded from running the
new regime.
Khomeini became leader because he provided a focal point for opposition to the shah’s regime, and because the army did not stop the people from
rising up against the monarchy. Once the shah was gone, Khomeini quickly asserted that it was he, not an interim government or a council representing all
interests, who was in charge. Although the masses brought down the old regime in hopes of obtaining a more democratic government, Khomeini ensured
that real power was retained by a small group of clerics. The parliament, while popularly elected, could only contain politicians who would support and be
supported by the Council of Guardians.
There is nothing special or unique about Khomeini’s success. That millions wanted the shah’s regime overturned is unsurprising. The shah ran a brutal,
oppressive government under which thousands disappeared. Imprisonment, torture, and death were commonplace. But that was equally true fourteen
years earlier when Khomeini went into exile and the shah’s government seemed invulnerable. The key to Khomeini’s success at the end of the 1970s was
that the army refused to stop the unhappy millions from taking to the streets. They had not allowed such protests before. What had changed? The army
was no longer willing to fight to preserve the regime because they knew that the shah was dying. The New York Times3 published accounts of the farce of
a sick leader desperate to hide the progression of his cancer. A dead shah couldn’t guarantee rewards. Neither could his successor. The incumbency
advantage unraveled. Faced with the unpleasant task of suppressing the people with only a modest prospect of continuing to enjoy the lavish rewards of
coalition membership, the army sat on its hands, smoothing the way for revolution.
The story of the rise of democracy in the Philippines is not much different. Benigno Aquino Jr. was an outstanding man. At the age of eighteen he was
awarded the Philippine Legion of Honor for his journalism during the Korean War. He then negotiated the surrender of a rebel group. He was mayor of
Concepcion by age twenty-two, governor of Tarlac Province at twenty-nine, and a senator by thirty-four. In a dangerous move, he became an outspoken
critic of President Ferdinand Marcos. In 1983, Benigno returned from exile in the United States. On the flight back to Manila he warned journalists that it
might all be over in minutes. And it was. He was immediately taken from the plane and assassinated on the tarmac. He should have followed Khomeini’s
example and bided his time.
His wife, Corazon, did not have his political skills or experience, but she had one critical advantage: She was alive! In late 1985 Ferdinand Marcos
announced snap elections a year earlier than scheduled. Corazon Aquino stepped in as her late husband’s surrogate and ran as the main opposition
candidate. There was widespread fraud at the elections on February 7, 1986, so it was of little surprise when just over a week later the electoral
commission declared Marcos the winner. But Marcos’s supporters swiftly deserted him. President Ronald Reagan expressed concern about the electoral
result. Cardinal Jamie Sin, leader of the influential Philippines’ Catholic Church, spoke out. At Corazon Aquino’s urging, the people protested. Key
members of the army and other leading political figures resigned from the government and joined the demonstrations. Without the army to stop them,
hundreds of thousands of people joined the protest, resulting in still more military leaders defecting.
In an attempt to avoid bloodshed, Marcos and his family sought sanctuary in the United States. They left the Philippines and settled in Hawaii but, as
insiders and many others knew, Marcos would not live long. That, in fact, had been his problem all along. He was dying of lupus and all his key backers
knew it. He could not deliver goodies from beyond the grave so his supporters sought to ingratiate themselves with someone who might benefit them.
Corazon Aquino had no experience in government. Yet she succeeded where her more accomplished husband had failed. She challenged Marcos at a
time when his supporters knew his time was coming to an end. They were looking for a new partner to defend in exchange for their rewards. Corazon
Aquino was inaugurated as president and voted Time magazine’s Woman of the Year for 1986.
These are not isolated examples. Laurent Kabila, once maligned by Che Guevara as lacking “revolutionary seriousness” and being “too addicted to
alcohol and women,” took on the mighty Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire and won.4 Kabila lacked much in talent, but his timing was excellent. Mobuto was
dying of prostate cancer and everybody knew it. His military simply refused to fight back as Kabila’s insurgents captured more and more territory.
Mobutu’s erstwhile backers knew that their own future would be brighter by abandoning their dying patron, a sentiment captured in the cliché, “the King is
dead, long live the King!”
Health concerns for North Korea’s Kim Jong Il and Cuba’s Fidel Castro have engendered similarly intense political speculation. Both have attempted to
stave off defection by their essential coalition members by nominating heirs. Kim Jong Il promoted his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, to a variety of posts,
including the rank of four-star general, even though his son has no military experience. Fidel Castro likewise promoted his brother, Raul, to president
when Fidel’s survival was in doubt following major surgery. By designating heirs who might keep the existing winning coalition largely intact, these leaders
sought to prevent the incumbency advantage from disappearing as their ability to deliver on political promises was brought into jeopardy.
Impending death often induces political death. The sad truth is that if you want to come to power in an autocracy you are better off stealing medical
records than you are devising fixes for your nation’s ills.
Inheritance and the Problem of Relatives
 
We don’t mean to say that healthy leaders don’t face hazards of their own. If an incumbent runs out of money he cannot continue to pay his supporters.
Why might he run out of money? Because he has taxed so heavily and stolen so much that the masses choose siestas over labor, stymieing the future
flow of revenue into the government’s treasury. Worse, the masses could choose revolution over siestas, emboldened by the realization that things will
only get worse if they do not act now to overthrow their masters. Mismanagement of coalition dynamics and the incentives of revolutionary entrepreneurs
can create changes in institutions that topple the incumbent regime and bring new leaders to power.
Normally one of the most difficult tasks a challenger faces is removing the incumbent. But this is instantly achieved when a leader dies or, as in the case
of William Tolbert, is murdered. Once an incumbent is dead, there is still the issue of fending off competitors for the dead leader’s job. Ambitious
challengers still need to grab control of the state apparatus, reward supporters, and eliminate rivals. To resolve this issue, the Ottomans, who ruled what is
today’s Turkey from 1299 until 1923, eventually instituted the law of fratricide.5
When the sultan died, the succession depended upon who could capture control of the state and reward his coalition. In practice this meant
