The Rules of Politics
 
THE LOGIC OF POLITICS IS NOT COMPLEX. IN FACT, it is surprisingly easy to grasp most of what goes on in the political world as long as we are
ready to adjust our thinking ever so modestly. To understand politics properly, we must modify one assumption in particular: we must stop thinking that
leaders can lead unilaterally.
No leader is monolithic. If we are to make any sense of how power works, we must stop thinking that North Korea’s Kim Jong Il can do whatever he
wants. We must stop believing that Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Genghis Khan or anyone else is in sole control of their respective nation. We must give
up the notion that Enron’s Kenneth Lay or British Petroleum’s (BP) Tony Hayward knew about everything that was going on in their companies, or that they
could have made all the big decisions. All of these notions are flat out wrong because no emperor, no king, no sheikh, no tyrant, no chief executive officer
(CEO), no family head, no leader whatsoever can govern alone.
Consider France’s Louis XIV (1638–1715). Known as the Sun King, Louis reigned as monarch for over seventy years, presiding over the expansion of
France and the creation of the modern political state. Under Louis, France became the dominant power in Continental Europe and a major competitor in
the colonization of the Americas. He and his inner circle invented a code of law that helped shape the Napoleonic code and that forms the basis of French
law to this day. He modernized the military, forming a professional standing army that became a role model for the rest of Europe and, indeed, the world.
He was certainly one of the preeminent rulers of his or any time. But he didn’t do it alone.
The etymology of monarchy may be “rule by one,” but such rule does not, has not, and cannot exist. Louis is thought famously (and probably falsely) to
have proclaimed, L’etat, c’est moi: the state, it is me. This declaration is often used to describe political life for supposedly absolute monarchs like Louis,
likewise for tyrannical dictators. The declaration of absolutism, however, is never true. No leader, no matter how august or how revered, no matter how
cruel or vindictive, ever stands alone. Indeed, Louis XIV, ostensibly an absolute monarch, is a wonderful example of just how false this idea of monolithic
leadership is.
After the death of his father, Louis XIII (1601–1643), Louis rose to the throne when he was but four years old. During the early years actual power
resided in the hands of a regent—his mother. Her inner circle helped themselves to France’s wealth, stripping the cupboard bare. By the time Louis
assumed actual control over the government in 1661, at the age of twenty-three, the state over which he reigned was nearly bankrupt.
While most of us think of a state’s bankruptcy as a financial crisis, looking through the prism of political survival makes evident that it really amounts to a
political crisis. When debt exceeds the ability to pay, the problem for a leader is not so much that good public works must be cut back, but rather that the
incumbent doesn’t have the resources necessary to purchase political loyalty from key backers. Bad economic times in a democracy mean too little
money to fund pork-barrel projects that buy political popularity. For kleptocrats it means passing up vast sums of money, and maybe even watching their
secret bank accounts dwindle along with the loyalty of their underpaid henchmen.
The prospect of bankruptcy put Louis’s hold on power at risk because the old-guard aristocrats, including the generals and officers of the army, saw
their sources of money and privilege drying up. Circumstances were ripe to prompt these politically crucial but fickle friends to seek someone better able
to ensure their wealth and prestige. Faced with such a risk, Louis needed to make changes, or else risk losing his monarchy.
Louis’s specific circumstances called for altering the group of people who had the possibility of becoming members of his inner circle—that is, the
group whose support guaranteed his continued dignity as king. He moved quickly to expand the opportunities (and for a few, the actual power) of new
aristocrats, called the noblesse de robe. Together with his chancellor, Michel Le Tellier, he acted to create a professional, relatively meretricious army. In
a radical departure from the practice observed by just about all of his neighboring monarchs, Louis opened the doors to officer ranks—even at the highest
levels—to make room for many more than the traditional old-guard military aristocrats, the noblesse d’épée. In so doing, Louis was converting his army
into a more accessible, politically and militarily competitive organization.
Meanwhile, Louis had to do something about the old aristocracy. He was deeply aware of their earlier disloyalty as instigators and backers of the
antimonarchy Fronde (a mix of revolution and civil war) at the time of his regency. To neutralize the old aristocracy’s potential threat, he attached them—
literally—to his court, compelling them to be physically present in Versailles much of the time. This meant that their prospects of income from the crown
depended on how well favored they were by the king. That, of course, depended on how well they served him.
By elevating so many newcomers, Louis had created a new class of people who were beholden to him. In the process, he was centralizing his own
authority more fully and enhancing his ability to enforce his views at the cost of many of the court’s old aristocrats. Thus he erected a system of “absolute”
control whose success depended on the loyalty of the military, the new aristocrats, and on tying the hands of the old aristocrats so that their welfare
translated directly into his welfare.
The French populace in general did not figure much into Louis’s calculations of who needed to be paid off—they did not represent an imminent threat to
him. Even so, it’s clear that his absolutism was not absolute at all. He needed supporters and he understood how to maintain their loyalty. They would be
loyal to him only so long as being so was more profitable for them than supporting someone else.
Louis’s strategy was to replace the “winning coalition” of essential supporters that he inherited with people he could more readily count on. In place of
the old guard he brought up and into the inner circle members of the noblesse de robe and even, in the bureaucracy and especially in the military, some
commoners. By expanding the pool of people who could be in the inner circle, he made political survival for those already in that role more competitive.
Those who were privileged to be in his winning coalition knew that under the enlarged pool of candidates for such positions, any one of them could easily
be replaced if they did not prove sufficiently trustworthy and loyal to the king. That, in turn, meant they could lose their opportunity for wealth, power, and
privilege. Few were foolish enough to take such a risk.
Like all leaders, Louis forged a symbiotic relationship with his inner circle. He could not hope to thrive in power without their help, and they could not
hope to reap the benefits of their positions without remaining loyal to him. Loyal they were. Louis XIV survived in office for seventy-two years until he died
quietly of old age in 1715.
Louis XIV’s experience exemplifies the most fundamental fact of political life. No one rules alone; no one has absolute authority. All that varies is how
many backs have to be scratched and how big the supply of backs available for scratching.
Three Political Dimensions
 
For leaders, the political landscape can be broken down into three groups of people: the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning
coalition.
The nominal selectorate includes every person who has at least some legal say in choosing their leader. In the United States it is everyone eligible to
vote, meaning all citizens aged eighteen and over. Of course, as every citizen of the United States must realize, the right to vote is important, but at the
end of the day no individual voter has a lot of say over who leads the country. Members of the nominal selectorate in a universal-franchise democracy
have a toe in the political door, but not much more. In that way, the nominal selectorate in the United States or Britain or France doesn’t have much more
power than its counterparts, the “voters,” in the old Soviet Union. There, too, all adult citizens had the right to vote, although their choice was generally to
say Yes or No to the candidates chosen by the Communist Party rather than to pick among candidates. Still, every adult citizen of the Soviet Union, where
voting was mandatory, was a member of the nominal selectorate. The second stratum of politics consists of the real selectorate. This is the group that
actually chooses the leader. In today’s China (as in the old Soviet Union), it consists of all voting members of the Communist Party; in Saudi Arabia’s
monarchy it is the senior members of the royal family; in Great Britain, the voters backing members of parliament from the majority party. The most
important of these groups is the third, the subset of the real selectorate that makes up a winning coalition. These are the people whose support is
essential if a leader is to survive in office. In the USSR the winning coalition consisted of a small group of people inside the Communist Party who chose
candidates and who controlled policy. Their support was essential to keep the commissars and general secretary in power. These were the folks with the
power to overthrow their boss—and he knew it. In the United States the winning coalition is vastly larger. It consists of the minimal number of voters who
give the edge to one presidential candidate (or, at the legislative level in each state or district, to a member of the House or Senate) over another. For
Louis XIV, the winning coalition was a handful of members of the court, military officers, and senior civil servants without whom a rival could have replaced
the king.
Fundamentally, the nominal selectorate is the pool of potential support for a leader; the real selectorate includes those whose support is truly influential;
and the winning coalition extends only to those essential supporters without whom the leader would be finished. A simple way to think of these groups is:
interchangeables, influentials, and essentials.
In the United States, the voters are the nominal selectorate—interchangeables . As for the real selectorate—influentials—the electors of the electoral
college really choose the president (just like the party faithful picked their general secretary back in the USSR), but the electors nowadays are normatively
bound to vote the way their state’s voters voted, so they don’t really have much independent clout in practice. In the United States, the nominal selectorate
and real selectorate are therefore pretty closely aligned. This is why, even though you’re only one among many voters, interchangeable with others, you
still feel like your vote is influential—that it counts and is counted. The winning coalition—essentials—in the United States is the smallest bunch of voters,
properly distributed among the states, whose support for a candidate translates into a presidential win in the electoral college. And while the winning
coalition (essentials) is a pretty big fraction of the nominal selectorate (interchangeables), it doesn’t have to be even close to a majority of the US
population. In fact, given the federal structure of American elections, it’s possible to control the executive and legislative branches of government with as
little as about one fifth of the vote, if the votes are really efficiently placed. (Abraham Lincoln was a master at just such voter efficiency.) It is worth
observing that the United States has one of the world’s biggest winning coalitions both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the electorate. But it is
not the biggest. Britain’s parliamentary structure requires the prime minister to have the support of a little over 25 percent of the electorate in two-party
elections to parliament. That is, the prime minister generally needs at least half the members of parliament to be from her party and for each of them to
win half the vote (plus one) in each two-party parliamentary race: half of half of the voters, or one quarter in total. France’s runoff system is even more
demanding. Election requires that a candidate win a majority in the final, two-candidate runoff.
Looking elsewhere we see that there can be a vast range in the size of the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning coalition. Some
places, like North Korea, have a mass nominal selectorate in which everyone gets to vote—it’s a joke, of course—a tiny real selectorate who actually pick
their leader, and a winning coalition that surely is no more than maybe a couple of hundred people (if that) and without whom even North Korea’s first
leader, Kim Il Sung, could have been reduced to ashes. Other nations, like Saudi Arabia, have a tiny nominal and real selectorate, made up of the royal
family and a few crucial merchants and religious leaders. The Saudi winning coalition is perhaps even smaller than North Korea’s.
How does Bell, California, measure up? We saw that in 2009, the interchangeables in Bell consisted of 9,395 registered voters; the influentials, the
2,235 who actually voted; and the essentials, not more than the 473 voters whose support was essential to win a seat on the city council. Bell definitely
looks better than North Korea or Saudi Arabia—we’d hope so. It looks alarmingly close, however, to the setup of a regime with mostly phony elections,
such as prerevolutionary Egypt, Venezuela, Cambodia, and maybe Russia. Most publicly traded corporations have this structure as well. They have
millions of shareholders who are the interchangeables. They have big institutional shareholders and some others who are the influentials. And the
essentials are pretty much those who get to pick actual board members and senior management. Bell doesn’t look much like Madison’s or
Montesquieu’s idealization of democracy and neither do corporations, regardless of how many shareholders cast proxy ballots.
Think about the company you work for. Who is your leader? Who are the essentials whose support he or she must have? What individuals, though not
essential to your CEO’s power, are nonetheless influential in the governance of the company? And then, of course, who is there every day at the office—
working hard (or not), just hoping for the breakthrough or the break that will catapult them into a bigger role?
These three groups provide the foundation of all that’s to come in the rest of this book, and, more importantly, the foundation behind the working of
politics in all organizations, big and small. Variations in the sizes of these three groups give politics a three-dimensional structure that clarifies the
complexity of political life. By working out how these dimensions intersect—that is, each organization’s mix in the size of its interchangeable, influential,
and essential groups—we can come to grips with the puzzles of politics. Differences in the size of these groups across states, businesses, and any other
organization, as you will see, decide almost everything that happens in politics—what leaders can do, what they can and can’t get away with, to whom
they answer, and the relative qualities of life that everyone under them enjoys (or, too often, doesn’t enjoy).
Virtues of 3 - D Politics
 
You may find it hard to believe that just these three dimensions govern all of the varied systems of leadership in the world. After all, our experience tends
to confirm that on one end of the political spectrum we have autocrats and tyrants—horrible, selfish thugs who occasionally stray into psychopathology. On
the other end, we have democrats—elected representatives, presidents, and prime ministers who are the benevolent guardians of freedom. Leaders
from these two worlds, we assure ourselves, must be worlds apart!
It’s a convenient fiction, but a fiction nonetheless. Governments do not differ in kind. They differ along the dimensions of their selectorates and winning
coalitions. These dimensions limit or liberate what leaders can and should do to keep their jobs. How limited or liberated a leader is depends on how
selectorates and winning coalitions interact.
No question, it is tough to break the habit of talking about democracies and dictatorships as if either of these terms is sufficient to convey the
differences across regimes, even though no two “democracies” are alike and neither are any two “dictatorships.” In fact, it is so hard to break that habit
that we will continue to use these terms much of the time throughout this book—but it is important to emphasize that the term “dictatorship” really means a
government based on a particularly small number of essentials drawn from a very large group of interchangeables and, usually, a relatively small batch of
influentials. On the other hand, if we talk about democracy, we really mean a government founded on a very large number of essentials and a very large
number of interchangeables, with the influential group being almost as big as the interchangeable group. When we mention monarchy or military junta, we
have in mind that the number of interchangeables, influentials, and essentials is small.
The beauty of talking about organizations in terms of essentials, influentials, and interchangeables is that these categories permit us to refrain from
arbitrarily drawing a line between forms of governance, pronouncing one “democratic” and another “autocratic,” or one a large republic and another small,
or any of the other mostly one-dimensional views of politics expressed by some of history’s leading political philosophers.
The truth is, no two governments or organizations are exactly alike. No two democracies are alike. Indeed, they can be radically different one from the
other and still qualify perfectly well as democracies. The more significant and observable differences in the behavior of governments and organizations
are dependent on the absolute and relative size of the interchangeable, influential, and essential groups. The seemingly subtle differences between, say,
France’s government and Britain’s, or Canada’s and the United States’s are not inconsequential. However, the variations in their policies are the product
of the incentives leaders face as they contend with their particular mix of interchangeable, influential, and essential groups.
There is incredible variety among political systems, mainly because people are amazingly inventive in manipulating politics to work to their advantage.
Leaders make rules to give all citizens the vote—creating lots of new interchangeables—but then impose electoral boundaries, stacking the deck of
essential voters to ensure that their preferred candidates win. Democratic elites may decide to require a plurality to win a particular race, giving
themselves a way to impose what a majority may otherwise reject. Or they might favor having runoff elections to create a majority, even though it may end
up being a majority of the interchangables’ second-place choices. Alternately democratic leaders might represent political views in proportion to how
many votes each view got, forging governments out of coalitions of minorities. Each of these and countless other rules easily can fall within our belief in
democracy, yet each can—and does—produce radically different results.
We must remember that labels like democracy or dictatorship are a convenience—but only a convenience.
Change the Size of Dimensions and Change the World1
 
Changing the relative size of interchangeables, influentials, and essentials can make a real difference in basic political outcomes. As an example, we can
