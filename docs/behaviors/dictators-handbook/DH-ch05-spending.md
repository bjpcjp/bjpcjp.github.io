Getting and Spending
 
AT LAST, A NEW RULER HAS SHAKEN UP THE COALITION that first brought him to power and he has the right supporters in place. Money is coming
in thanks to the taxes being levied. Now comes the real task of governing: allocating money to keep the coalition happy—but not too happy—and
providing just enough to keep the interchangeables from rising up in revolt. As we have seen in North Africa and the Middle East in the past few years,
and as we saw in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, this can be an awkward tightrope to traverse for any leader. The last few decades encourage
us by showing that in time many autocrats fall off that tightrope. It is really hard to strike just the right balance between benefits for one’s coalition and for
the mass of interchangeables.
Any new incumbent who wants to be around for a long time needs to fine-tune the art of spending money. Of course, he can err on the side of
generosity to the coalition or to the people—but only with any money that is left for his own discretionary use after taking care of the coalition’s needs. He
had better not err on the side of shortchanging anyone who could mount a coup or a revolution. Shortchange the wrong people and any leader’s fate will
confirm our abuse of William Wordsworth’s famous line: “Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.”
Thus we turn to the essential question of all democracies: how to allocate resources aimed at providing policies of benefit to everyone in a society.
These public goods come in a variety of different forms depending on the tastes of those in a position to demand such policies. Those in such a position,
of course, are the incumbent’s essential backers. Different groups of essentials will have different baskets of public goods–oriented policies in mind.
Some will want to spend more on a social welfare safety net; others on education; still others on benefits for the elderly or for the young; benefits to the
arts and so forth. Although all of these are of interest and will be touched upon, however briefly, we are especially interested in core public benefits like
education, health care, and such freedoms as a free press, free speech, and freedom of assembly.
Although security against foreign invasion certainly is a central public good, we leave consideration of foreign threats to a later chapter and focus here
on domestic policy choices. For now, let’s have a look at how public goods can help society as a whole and how they help entrenched leaders.
Effective Policy Need Not Be Civic Minded
 
To balance between spending policies that benefit the masses and those that favor the essentials, leaders would do well to reflect on those parts of
Thomas Hobbes’s philosophy of government, which we touched on briefly in the introduction. He had a lot right, but Hobbes’s ideas about government
weren’t infallible. While he realized that anyone who enriched society would avoid a revolution such as the one he lived through in England, he failed to
distinguish between what it takes to keep the people at bay and what it takes to keep essential backers from betraying their leader—whether that leader
is Hobbes’s Leviathan, Plato’s Philosopher King, Rousseau’s General Will, or Madison’s factionridden representatives of the people. Hobbes was sure
his Leviathan had to be a benign ruler. That, so Hobbes seems to have thought, was the way to prevent a revolution such as he experienced. Without a
ruler who enriched his people, Hobbes feared that for many, life would be, in his well-coined phrase, solitary, nasty, poor, brutish, and short.
Hobbes was only half right. It is true, as Hobbes’s believed, that happy, well-cared-for people are unlikely to revolt. China’s prolonged economic growth
seems to have verified that belief (at least for now). Keep them fat and happy and the masses are unlikely to rise up against you. It seems equally true,
however, that sick, starving, ignorant people are also unlikely to revolt. All seems quiet among North Korea’s masses, who deify their Dear Leader as the
sole source of whatever meager, life-sustaining resources they have. Who makes revolution? It is the great in-between; those who are neither
immiserated nor coddled. The former are too weak and cowered to revolt. The latter are content and have no reason to revolt. Truly it is the great in-
between who are a threat to the stability of a regime and its leaders. Therefore, a prudent leader balances resources between keeping the coalition
content and the people just fit enough to produce the wealth needed to enrich the essentials and the incumbent. We should not be surprised that those
countries whose governments rely on few essential backers—that is, those that are least democratic—are the very places where Hobbes’s state of nature
is most likely to be an apt description of life for the masses. They are also, as we saw earlier, the places where leaders have the best prospect of staying
in control for years and years.
Leaders who depend on a large coalition have to work hard to make sure that their citizens’ lives are not solitary, nasty, poor, brutish, and short. That
doesn’t mean democratic rulers have to be civic minded, nor would they need to harbor warm and cuddly feelings for their citizens. All they need is to
ensure that there are ample public benefits to provide a high quality of life. They just need to follow the rules by which successful leaders rule, adapting
them to the difficult circumstances that any democrat faces: being stuck with dependence on an unruly crowd of essentials to keep them in power.
Just as democrats have no need of being civic visionaries, dictators likewise aren’t bound to make life miserable. It just happens, more often than not,
to work out better for them to do so. There are exceptions, but those exceptions tend simply to reaffirm the importance of obeying the rules of politics. As
we have noted, it is okay for a leader to spend her pot of discretionary money on trying to bring the good life to her citizenry. By definition, discretionary
money is money that is not required to keep the coalition loyal; the coalition has already been paid off before any resources become discretionary.
Singapore, for example, has managed through benevolent dictatorship to produce a high quality of material life for its citizens, albeit without many of the
freedoms that others hold dear. Maybe Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore’s long-time benefactor, was the embodiment of Hobbes’s Leviathan. But benevolent
dictators like Singapore’s are hard to find.
The most reliable means to a good life for ordinary people remains the presence of institutional incentives in the form of dependence on a big coalition
that compels power-seeking politicians to govern for the people. Democracy, especially with little or no organized bloc voting, aligns incentives such that
politicians can best serve their own self-interest, especially their interest in staying in office, by promoting the welfare of a large proportion of the people.
That, we believe, is why most democracies are prosperous, stable, and secure places to live.
Perhaps you doubt that the path to a good life is ensured by the presence of a big coalition. You wouldn’t be alone. Many distinguished economists,
even quite a few with the Nobel Prize under their belts, are convinced that the best way to promote democracy is by promoting prosperity. That is why
whenever they see an economic crisis looming on the horizon, such as a government so indebted that it is on the verge of default and bankruptcy, they call
for debt forgiveness, new loans, lots of foreign aid, and other economic fixes. They resist the cry of people like us who demand improved governance
before any bailout money is offered up to rescue a troubled autocratic economy. They are convinced that wealth—and not politics—is the better route to
escape Hobbes’s state of nature. Simply reviewing the history of economic bailouts that we began in the previous chapter makes clear that the very
forgiveness without political change so eagerly embraced for third-world financial crises is rarely sought when the crisis arises in a society that relies on a
large coalition.
Bailouts and Coalition Size
 
The politics of economic bailouts can be quite different in small and large coalition regimes. Bailouts come in many forms: shifts in domestic taxing and
spending; loans, whether from banks at home or abroad; debt forgiveness; or foreign aid. Any bailout is accompanied by demands for economic reform,
whether the money comes from the IMF, the German Central Bank, or the taxpayers. A big difference between large- and small-coalition bailout recipients
is that the former almost always institute reforms and the latter only infrequently do.
Just like debt forgiveness, a bailout in the face of economic stress for autocrats is a way to solve an impending political crisis. When their economy
becomes too feeble to provide sufficient money to buy political loyalty, autocrats face being overthrown either by a rival or a revolution. This, in a nutshell,
is the story of the politico-economic crises faced by places like Tunisia and Egypt in 2011. A bailout, whether generated from within or through outside
loans or aid, can buy off opposition and thwart the threat to the leader’s hold on power. Therefore, during an economic crisis autocrats shop around for
bailout money from others to save themselves in the name of relieving their country’s financial woes.
For large coalition leaders bailouts are a curse, or at least a necessary evil. A poorly performing economy is likely to be understood by voters as a
policy failure by the leadership, resulting in their being thrown out by the voters at the first opportunity. That was very much a part of the story of the defeat
of the Republican Party in 2008 and, when the economy did not turn around fast enough to satisfy voters, the defeat of the Democrats in the House of
Representatives in 2010. So the need for an economic bailout strongly signals the voters to find new leaders with new policy ideas. Foreign aid rarely
comes to the rescue of democrats, for reasons we explain later. Therefore, financial crises and the need for a bailout are just about always bad news for
democrats.
The rich countries of the world faced a severe economic crisis in 2008 and 2009. Both the Bush and Obama administrations sought to stem the worst
of the crisis by providing massive financial bailouts to save the banking industries and other large businesses, restore liquidity in the market, and bring
the US economy back onto a path toward sustained growth. Much the same was done in Europe. These bailouts were accompanied by regulatory
change. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed by President Obama in 2010, is a case in point. Faced with a severe
recession, the Congress passed the largest regulatory reform since the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.
In contrast, in small-coalition regimes, bailouts all too often are the means to preserve business as usual. Economic bailouts in autocracies rarely
precipitate a serious review of economic or business policies. They are almost never accompanied by regulatory reform. Consequently, economic crises
happen more often than in democracies and, so long as rich nations feel an urge to provide loans, debt forgiveness, or aid, rarely result in betterment for
the society although they do result in security for lousy leaders.
Is Democracy a Luxury?
 
Are dictators and economists right that economic solvency needs to come ahead of political change? Is becoming materially rich the precursor for the
luxury of democracy? We think not. There are plenty of well-to-do places that nevertheless suffer under oppressive governments that keep ordinary
peoples’ lives as solitary, nasty, poor, brutish, and short as their neighbors in poorer nations. Take a look at just about any nondemocratic oil-rich or
diamond-studded regime.
Yes, the world has produced wise, well-intentioned leaders even among those who depend on few essentials, but it neither produces a lot of them nor
does it ensure that they have good ideas about how to make life better for others. Indeed, a common refrain among small-coalition rulers is that the very
freedoms, like free speech, free press, and especially freedom of assembly, that promote welfare-improving government policies are luxuries to be doled
out only after prosperity is achieved and not before. This seems to be the self-serving claim of leaders who keep their people poor and oppressed. The
People’s Republic of China is the poster boy for this view. When Deng Xiaoping introduced economic liberalization to China in the 1980s, experts in
wealthy Western countries contended that now China’s economy would grow and the growth would lead to rapid democratization. Today, more than thirty
years into sustained rapid growth we still await these anticipated political reforms. Growth does not guarantee political improvement but neither does it
preclude it. The Republic of China (aka Taiwan) and the Republic of Korea (aka South Korea) are models of building prosperity ahead of democracy.
Needless to say, the People’s Republic of China certainly is not fond of promoting either of those countries’ experiences.
Many economists arrive at the same inference as dictators, though from an entirely different perspective. For many economists, the contention that
nations work on becoming rich before becoming free follows from how they think about politics. They treat politics as just so much friction, to be written off
instead of dealt with.
No doubt it is good to be rich, and many of the world’s rich countries are democratic. But dependence on a large coalition of essentials is a powerful
explanation of quality of life even when wealth is absent, just as it seems to be a harbinger of future wealth. Economic growth and success, in contrast,
does not seem to be an assurance of improved governance and, indeed, may hinder it.1 This is a question worth exploring in greater depth, though for
now our subject is how variations in the size of the group of essentials and interchangeables determines how resources are allocated between public and
private rewards so as to pay just the right amount to one’s coalition while also paying just enough to keep the citizenry from making trouble.
Public Goods Not for the Public’s Good
 
From a leader’s point of view, the most important function of the people is to pay taxes. All regimes need money. As a result, certain basic public goods
must be made available even by the meanest autocrat, unless he has access to significant revenue from sources, like oil or foreign aid, that are not
based on taxing workers. Public benefits like essential infrastructure, education, and health care, need to be readily available to ensure that labor is
productive enough to pay taxes to line the pockets of rulers and their essential supporters. These policies are not instituted for the betterment of the
masses, even though, of course, some members of the masses, especially workers, benefit from them.
Education, as a means for getting ahead in life, is a big deal for any country’s citizenry. Indeed, a popular refrain among many liberalminded thinkers is
to extol the quality of education in otherwise oppressive states like Castro’s Cuba or even Kim Jong-Il’s North Korea. And they have a good point. Both
Cuba and North Korea have impressive primary education. For instance a 1997 UNESCO study finds that Cuban third and fourth graders far outperform
their counterparts in other Latin American countries, As for North Korea, it has a 100 percent literacy rate. In contrast, only 81 percent of democratic
India’s people can read and write.2 But these facts can be misleading, or even downright wrong. That basic education is mandatory and extensive in such
places often is used to argue that autocracy isn’t so bad.
Rarely do any of us stop to probe beneath these observations to find out why dictators pay to have well-educated third graders—but do not carry that
quality of education forward to higher learning. The logic behind political survival teaches us to be suspicious. We cannot help but believe that these
public goods are not intended to uplift and assist the people unfortunate enough to live in such places. The rules of politics, as we know, instruct leaders to
do no more for the people than is absolutely essential to prevent rebellion. Leaders who spend on public welfare at the expense of their essentials are
courting disaster.
These leaders, whether dictators or democrats, are all grappling with the same question: How much education is the right amount? For those who rely
on few essential backers the answer is straightforward. Educational opportunity should not be so extensive as to equip ordinary folks, the
interchangeables, to question government authority. A naïve person might look at any number of awful regimes and yet come to the conclusion that,
because they provide such public benefits as nationalized health care or sound primary education, they’re actually better to their people than many
democratic states are to theirs. This is nonsense, of course—in the vast majority of cases autocrats are simply keeping the peasants healthy enough to
work and educated enough to do their jobs. Either way, literate or not, they’re still peasants and they’re going to stay that way.
A far better measure of leaders’ interest in education is the distribution of top universities. With the sole exceptions of China and Singapore, no
nondemocratic country has even one university rated among the world’s top 200. Despite its size, and not counting universities in Hong Kong, which were
established under British rule before Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, the best-ranked Chinese university is only in 47th place despite China’s
opportunity to draw top minds from its vast population. The highest ranking Russian university, with Russia’s long history of dictatorship, is 210th. By
contrast, countries with relatively few people but with dependence on many essential backers, like Israel, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and
Canada, have several universities ranked among the top 200.3 That this uneven distribution of top-notch universities favors large-coalition locales is no
accident.
Highly educated people are a potential threat to autocrats, and so autocrats make sure to limit educational opportunity. Autocrats want workers to have
basic labor skills like literacy, and they want their own children—their most likely successors—to be truly well educated, and so send them off to schools in
places like Switzerland, where Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il’s youngest son and designated successor, was educated. Dictators also like to have their
children educated in leading universities in the United States, and especially at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. In fact, one might almost
conclude that Oxford is a breeding ground for authoritarians. It certainly is the alma mater of many, including Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, the Bhutto
family of Pakistan, kings of Jordan, Bhutan, Malaysia, and even little Tonga. England’s big coalition system opens the door pretty broadly to give access
to higher education.
When the leadership relies on few essentials, higher education is for the children of the powerful; when the bloc of essentials is big, it is for the
betterment of everyone. One of the features of the old Soviet regime that Boris Yeltsin balked at, for instance, was exactly the privileged access that
children of Communist Party leaders had to the best universities regardless of their ability. Kids of loyal families were helped to get ahead. The capable
children of potentially dissident families were kept down by being excluded from broad access to the best schools.4
One thing that both dictatorships and democracies have in common is the special advantage insiders seem to have when it comes to th
