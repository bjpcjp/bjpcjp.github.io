Staying in Power
 
AT LONG LAST, THE ASPIRANT TO HIGH OFFICE HAS triumphed. Whether through inheritance, coup, election, revolt, murder, or mayhem, he has
seized power. Now he faces a new challenge: hanging on to it.
As Sergeant Doe’s brutal career has taught us, rising to a high position often requires skills altogether different from those needed to maintain control.
And even the rules for surviving in power do not always resemble the skills necessary for ruling well. The novelist Italo Calvino has clearly and succinctly
described the tribulations of those who have risen to power: “The throne, once you have been crowned, is where you had best remain seated, without
moving, day and night. All your previous life has been only a waiting to become king; now you are king; you have only to reign. And what is reigning if not
this long wait? Waiting for the moment when you will be deposed, when you will have to take leave of the throne, the scepter, the crown, and your head.”1
What, then, must a newly minted leader do to keep his (or her) head? A good starting place is to shore up the coalition of supporters. This may seem
like a simple enough task. After all, as we’ve seen, the heights of power are unattainable without the backing of a coalition strong enough to beat back
rivals. However, a wise leader does not count too much on those who helped her gain power. Remember the fate of many of Fidel Castro’s closest allies.
After toppling the previous leader, it’s only a matter of time until they realize that they can do the same again.
A prudent new incumbent will act swiftly to get some of them out of the way and bring in others whose interests more strongly assure their future loyalty.
Only after sacking, shuffling, and shrinking their particular set of essentials can a leader’s future tenure be assured.
Nor is this only true of dictators. To see this urge to build a modified coalition at work in the seemingly less ferocious world of business, let’s take a look
at Carly Fiorina’s rise and fall as CEO at Hewlett-Packard.
Governance in Pursuit of Heads
 
CEOs, just like national leaders, are susceptible to removal. Being vulnerable to a coup, they need to modify the corporate coalition (usually the board of
directors and senior management), bringing in loyalists and getting rid of potential troublemakers. Usually, they have a large potential pool of people to
draw from and prior experience to help guide their choices. But, also like national leaders, they face resistance from some members of their inherited
coalition and that may be hard to overcome.
Most publicly traded corporations have millions of interchangeables (their shareholders), a considerably smaller set of influentials (big individual
shareholders and institutional shareholders), and a small group of essentials, often not more than ten to fifteen people. In a group of this size, even
seemingly minor variations in the number of coalition members can have profound consequences for how a company is run. As we will see, this was
particularly true for Hewlett-Packard (HP), because, as in all companies, small shifts in coalition numbers can lead to large percentage changes in the
expected mix of corporate rewards.
In the case of HP, the CEO’s winning coalition made up a relatively large fraction of the real selectorate because ownership is heavily concentrated in a
few hands. That is, we might count corporate coalition size in terms of the number of its members or in terms of the number of shares owned by them. In
HP’s case, the essential bloc and the influential bloc are a tiny part of the total selectorate because the families of the company’s founders, William
Hewlett and David Packard, retain significant ownership just as was true of the Ford Motor Company, Hallmark Cards, and quite a few other businesses
for many years.
Involvement in a corporation can yield benefits, just like any other form of government. These benefits can take the form of rewards given to everyone or
private payments directed just to the essentials. In a corporate setting, private benefits typically come as personal compensation in the form of salary,
perks, and stock options. Rewards to everyone—what economists call “public goods”—take the shape of dividends (an equal amount per share) and
increased stock value. When the winning coalition is sufficiently large that private rewards are an inefficient mechanism for the CEO to buy the loyalty of
essentials, public goods tend to be the benefit of choice. Usually, coalition members are eager to receive private benefits. However, dividends and
growth in share value are preferred over private rewards by very large shareholders who happen also to be in the winning coalition—this would make
them the biggest recipients of the rewards that go to all shareholders. That was precisely the situation in HP, where the Hewlett and Packard families
owned a substantial percentage of the company.
 
Who makes up the essentials in a corporation? The coalition typically includes no more than a few people in senior management and the members of the
board of directors. These directors are drawn from a mix of senior management in the company, large institutional shareholders, handpicked friends and
relatives of the CEO (generally described as civic leaders, no doubt), and the CEO herself. In the parlance of economists who study corporations, the
makeup of these boards boils down to insiders (employees), grey members (friends, relatives), and outsiders. One part of any corporate board’s duties
is to appoint, retain, or remove CEOs. Generally CEOs keep their job for a long time and that certainly was true of HP’s first CEO, founder David
Packard. He was replaced in 1992 by an insider, Lewis Platt, who had worked for the firm since the 1960s. Platt retired in 1999 and was replaced by
outsider Carly Fiorina. The HP board has repeatedly deposed CEOs since then.
It should be obvious that any board members involved in deposing the former CEO have the potential to be a problem for a new CEO. Having once
been a coup maker, there is little reason to doubt that they stand ready to start trouble once again if they think the circumstances warrant it. And what
could those circumstances be but application of one or more of the rules of governance we set out earlier, especially if that application harms their
interests.
Research into CEO longevity teaches us, not surprisingly, that time in office lengthens as one maintains close personal ties to members of the board.
Just as sons and daughters may make attractive inheritors of the mantle of power in a dictatorship, friends, relatives, and fellow employees can generate
the expectation of more loyal supporters after power is achieved. This logic probably contributed to Lewis Platt’s elevation to CEO of HP. Putting more
outsiders on a board translates on average into better returns for shareholders, a benefit to everyone. At the same time, it also translates into greater risk
for the CEO.2 Since the CEO’s interest is rarely the same as the shareholder’s interest, CEOs prefer to avoid outsider board members if they can.
Corporate problems, especially those serious enough to oust a sitting CEO, can serve to galvanize attention and enhance oversight by the board,
making existing coalitions less reliable. Furthermore it is likely that the new, replacement CEO will face real impediments to his efforts to create and
shape a board of directors in the wake of an older CEO’s deposition. After all, the old board members did not get rid of the prior incumbent with the idea
that they would also make it easy for the successor CEO to get rid of them. Nevertheless, any new CEO worth her salt will try to do just that. The long-
lasting CEOs are the ones who succeed.
Carly Fiorina became Hewlett-Packard’s CEO in 1999. After six turbulent years she was deposed from that position and as chairwoman of the board
in early 2005. Prior to being removed she was the target of an unsuccessful proxy fight mounted by Walter Hewlett and David Woodley Packard, sons of
HP’s founders. The board, in keeping with the power of inherited insider influence, also included Susan Orr, founder David Packard’s daughter. All were
individuals with big financial stakes in HP. Furthermore, as big shareholders Hewlett, Packard, and Orr were more concerned about HP’s overall
performance than about any private benefits they got from being on the board. Good news for shareholders—potentially bad news for Fiorina.
The board that selected Fiorina as CEO consisted of fourteen members. As we’ve seen, three were relatives of HP’s founders; three more were
current or retired HP employees.3 Fiorina’s initial board, in other words, had a substantial group of insider and grey members who were not of her
choosing and who had big stakes in the corporation’s stock value. It is not hard to see that Carly Fiorina needed to make changes to build a leaner board
with stronger attachments to her. It would not be easy—while the previous board selected her, they were not her handpicked loyalists.
She achieved results, nonetheless. A year after Fiorina’s ascension, HP’s proxy statement to its shareholders in 2000 listed only eleven board
members, 20 percent fewer than the group that selected her. Three, including David Woodley Packard, were gone. As Fiorina became more entrenched
in her position, the board continued to shrink—the 2001 statement listed only ten board members, a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the board she
originally inherited. Seemingly growing more secure in her control, Fiorina launched an effort to merge Compaq with HP, an effort with both beneficial
prospects and serious risks for her continued rule.
Naturally, Fiorina presented the merger as a boon for HP and its shareholders. As Fiorina explained on February 4, 2002,
It is a rare opportunity when a technology company can advance its market position substantially and reduce its cost structure substantially at the
same time. And this is possible because Compaq and HP are in the same businesses, pursuing the same strategies, in the same markets, with
complementary capabilities. So, yes, we thought about a go-slow approach. But, we concluded, after two-and-a-half years of careful deliberation and
preparation, that standing still had enormous risks.... Standing still means choosing the path of retreat, not leadership.4
 
There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Fiorina’s expectations for the Compaq merger. But it is instructive to examine a major indicator of how
Fiorina’s appointment and how her views meshed with broader market sentiments. The day before the announcement of Carly Fiorina’s appointment as
HP’s new CEO, HP’s shares traded at $53.43. The market’s reaction to her appointment can reasonably be described as uncertain. The price of HP
shares was flat immediately following the announcement and then began a decline, falling to under $39 by mid-October 1999, about three months later. Of
course, markets are forward looking and so investors were watching and learning, modifying their expectations as Fiorina took charge. The news and
modified expectations must have been good for a while because by early April 2000, HP’s shares had risen markedly to about $78. But good feelings
and good circumstances were not to prevail for long. After April 7 the share price went into a tailspin, bottoming out in September 2002 at around $12 a
share, and significantly underperforming the major stock market indexes. By the time Fiorina resigned in February 2005, HP’s share price had only
rebounded to about $20.
With respect to the Compaq merger, the market was similarly pessimistic. The plan to merge with Compaq was announced on September 3, 2001.
The shares rose on the news, with a peak in December of that year of about $23, though still well below the value the day before Carly Fiorina became
CEO. Over the period from July 1999 (the announcement of Fiorina’s appointment) to the end of December 2001, the adjusted Dow Jones index fell 9.4
percent while HP’s adjusted share price fell 47 percent.
From the perspective of any big investor in HP, including the Hewlett and Packard families, Fiorina must have looked like a disaster. Their company
was doing worse than the general stock market; their fortunes were being hammered. She was a CEO in trouble. Nevertheless, the upward tick in the
share value indicated a renewed, if temporary, boost of optimism at the announced intention to merge with Compaq. But markets don’t like infighting, and
when Walter Hewlett and David Woodley Packard declared their opposition to the merger, the gains were reversed. Soon the price collapsed even
further, halving as it became apparent that there was to be a proxy fight in which Hewlett and Packard sought to muster support from enough shareholders
to defeat the board’s proposed slate at the corporation’s annual meeting. No doubt Fiorina realized that she was going to be in for a tough time, perhaps
even before her public announcement of the intended and eventually successfully completed merger. It also seems likely that she would already have
known Hewlett and Packard’s views. We can only conclude that this was an intentional gamble on a major policy shift, one that could—and did—
adversely affect the wealth of HP’s large shareholders (such as present or former board members Hewlett and Packard).
Looking at the Compaq-HP merger politically, we can see several critical themes emerging. Fiorina was already in some trouble because of declining
share value. She had successfully diminished the board’s size and shuffled its membership, both wise choices for a CEO seeking longevity in office. Yet
despite these actions, she still faced significant opposition from the inner circle of essentials and influentials. She had not yet secured the board’s loyalty.
The Compaq merger might have made good business sense and could therefore have been good for the stock price, thus softening internal opposition to
her. Or else, seeing the merger as a fait accompli, her opponents might have given up their fight. That didn’t happen. And the disgruntled board members,
heavily invested as they were in HP’s stock value, could not be mollified with private rewards.
However, what in retrospect may seem like a political nonstarter at the time held great political advantages. What, for instance, had to be an
implication for board composition of Fiorina’s multibillion dollar merger with Compaq? Once the deal was sealed Fiorina would have to bring some
Compaq leaders onto the postmerger HP board. This could be done either by expanding the existing board to accommodate Compaq influentials or by
pruning the existing board to make room for the new, Compaq representatives drawn from Compaq’s selectorate. Fiorina apparently saw that the merger
would provide an opportunity to reconstitute the board, providing an undeniable opportunity to weaken the board faction that opposed her. That seems to
be exactly what she tried to do.
Of course, her rivals would not sit idly by and be purged. Unless such a purge can be accomplished in the dark, presented as a fait accompli to the old
group of influentials, the risk of failure is real. As it happens, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations require disclosures, which make
turning a board purge into a fait accompli extremely difficult when the opportunity to purge the board depends on a prospective merger.
There are two potential responses to a rebellion such as the one Fiorina faced over HP’s weak share price and the Compaq merger. A CEO can either
purge essentials and boost the private benefits to remaining coalition members, or expand the coalition and increase rewards to the general selectorate
of interchangeables (that is, shareholders). Having survived the proxy fight in 2002, Fiorina faced an eleven-member board that included five new
members carried over from Compaq as part of the merger. HP’s board had shifted materially with only six previous HP board members on it. Since
Fiorina had been the mover and shaker behind the Compaq deal it is reasonable to believe that she assumed the new members would be likely to work
with her as opposed to lining up with board members who had supported Walter Hewlett’s fight against the merger. Walter Hewlett and Robert P.
Wayman, meanwhile, left the board. By this time Fiorina had expanded the total board size by only one, from ten to eleven, while overseeing the departure
of several old board members at the same time to make room for five Compaq representatives. Surely she had reason to believe she now enjoyed the
support of a majority of the new board.
Perhaps in an effort to shore up the support of remaining old hands on the board, or perhaps coincidentally, there also was a notable shift in board
compensation. Just before Fiorina became HP’s head, board members earned compensation (that is, private benefits) that ranged from $105,700 to
$110,700. With Fiorina in office and the board diminished in size, this amount dropped slightly to $100,000–$105,000 and remained there in the years
2000–2003. But in 2004, according to HP’s 2005 proxy statement, board members received $200,000 to $220,000. During the same period, dividends
remained steady at $0.32 a share annually and HP’s shares significantly underperformed the main stock market indexes. Clearly something was up: HP’s
stock price performance was poor; dividends were steady; and directors’ pay doubled.
Fiorina’s board shuffling and their improved compensation seem aimed at getting the right loyalists in place to help her survive. Although the Compaq
merger resulted in the board growing from ten to eleven, what is most noteworthy is that this net growth of one member was achieved while adding five
new members (one of whom stepped down at the end of the year). So, the old members constituted only about half the board, shifting the potential
balance of power toward Fiorina. Presumably that is just what she hoped, although it is not how things turned out.
Expanding the board was not, and generally is not, the optimal response to a threat from within. To her credit, in terms of political logic, she significantly
expanded the size of the interchangeables by adding Compaq’s shareholders to HP’s list of shareholders. This normally helps to induce strengthened
loyalty, but declining share value could not have been good for new HP board members, who had been heavily invested in Compaq since their economic
well-being was now tied to HP’s share performance. Nor could Fiorina mollify HP’s large shareholders on the board with better board compensation,
since their welfare depended on producing the “public good” of greater returns to shareholders. Those grey board members who owned lots of shares
made the seemingly small board of eleven actually pretty large in terms of shares they could vote.
Under enormous pressure, Carly Fiorina stepped down. She was replaced by Patricia Dunn as chairwoman, with HP’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
Robert Wayman, emerging again as a significant HP player. He was made interim CEO. Wayman, unable or uninterested in translating his interim
position into a full-time job, stepped down a month later while continuing in his role as a member of the board and an HP employee. Mark Hurd in turn
replaced him as CEO.
In the immediate aftermath of Fiorina’s ouster the board separated two key positions, CEO and chairperson, presumably in a good Montesquieu-like
effort to promote the separation of powers and protect themselves against future adverse choices by the CEO. If that was their intention, they certainly
failed. Following Hurd’s ascent to the position of CEO he successfully brought the two posts back under one person’s control: his own.
Within a year of Fiorina’s ouster, all the leading coup makers who acted against her were gone. Mark Hurd had risen to the top and, as suggested by
the quote from Italo Calvino, he had to watch day and night
