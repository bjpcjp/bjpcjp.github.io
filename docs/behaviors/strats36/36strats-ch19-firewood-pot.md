Steal the Firewood From Under the Pot 
When attacking a strong force, it is difficult to attack it 
directly as it stands. In these cases, one attacks the corners. 
In large scale battles, after careful inspection of the enemy's 
forces, one can gain advantage by attacking the corners of 
exposed strategic points. When one has eliminated the 
strength of the corners, the strength of the whole will also be 
diminished. 
 
Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings 
 
When faced with an enemy too powerful to engage directly you must 
first weaken him by undermining his foundation and attacking his 
source of power. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
The king of Wei had amassed and trained a large army with which he 
intended to expand his territories. The strength of his army frightened

several neighboring barons and princes into supporting his dreams of 
conquest and, with twelve lords pressed into an alliance, he went to the 
emperor to receive permission to increase his territories. 13 
 
With his imperial blessing in hand, the king of Wei first set his sights 
on Qin. The king of Qin realized his territory would be the first to fall 
under the Wei expansion and convened his council for advice.  
 
One advisor by the name of Wei Yang asked permission to travel to 
Wei so that he could prevent the army from attacking. 
 
"And how do you plan to accomplish this?" asked the king. 
 
"Have you not heard that defeat can be achieved at a banquet, generals 
captured while in a sitting room, cities razed between wine and the 
spiced meat, and a battering ram broken by a sleeping mat?" 
 
The king confessed he had not and gave permission for Wei Yang to 
travel to Wei and try this unusual strategy.  
 
When Wei Yang arrived at the Wei court, his reputation enabled him to 
have an audience with the king. 
 
There he said to the king, "Your majesty's accomplishments are great. 
Your order is obeyed throughout the land, and you are leader of the 
twelve lords. Soon you will control enough of the country to become 
emperor. However, to be recognized as emperor you must look and act 
like an emperor. The first step would be to build a palace befitting an 
emperor of the realm." 
 
The king was flattered and immediately began construction on a 
massive scale to increase the size of his palaces. 
 
Then Wei Yang told the king, "Now you must begin to look like an 
emperor and wear the scarlet robes, raise the nine pennants of power, 
and fly the flag of the Red Bird Constellation 14.”

The king could not resist flaunting his power openly and he was soon 
walking about dressed in red robes and accompanied by imperial 
pennants and flags.  
 
It soon became apparent to everyone in the empire that the king of Wei 
had visions of becoming emperor. This angered the noble houses, 
especially those of the more powerful kingdoms of Chu and Qi, any 
one of whom would have a far more legitimate claim to the throne than 
that provincial upstart, the king of Wei. 
  
Through Wei Yang's subtle manipulations the twelve lords were 
persuaded to secretly switch their allegiance to Qi. When a large Qi 
army penetrated the Wei border, the king of Wei called on the twelve 
lords to stop the invasion. However, they captured the king instead and 
placed him in prison.  
 
When the Qi army arrived, they installed another prince on the throne 
of Wei and, to prevent Wei from becoming too powerful in the future, 
parceled out much of its territory to the neighboring kingdoms. 
 
Thus, while the king of Qin sat calmly watching, Wei Yang was able to 
avert the impending attack by Wei, bring down its king, and annex a 
portion of Wei territory, without so much as drawing a weapon.  
 
After receiving the king's honors Wei Yang said, "This is what is meant 
by defeat achieved at a banquet, generals captured while in a sitting 
room, cities razed between wine and the spiced meat, and a battering 
ram broken by a sleeping mat." 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
The rebel warlord Cao Cao was on campaign against General Yuan 
Shao when he was joined by a third general, Xu Yu, who inquired about 
their current situation.  
 
Cao Cao replied, "We have only one month of supplies left while 
General Yuan has a year's worth of provisions stored within easy 
access at his garrison at Wu Chao. As it stands now we will be defeated 
within a month."

General Yu thereupon devised the following stratagem. He ordered a 
division of his elite cavalry to dress as Yuan troops and to muffle their 
horse's hooves by wrapping them in cloth. The disguised cavalry set out 
the next night carrying Yuan banners. Whenever they encountered a 
real Yuan patrol or checkpoint, the captain would tell them they were 
safeguarding Yuan's rear against a possible sneak attack.  
 
Silently arriving at the garrison by dawn, the elite cavalry took the 
Yuan troops by surprise and succeeded in setting fire to the stores.  
 
When the report made its way through the Yuan army that their 
provisions had been destroyed, they quickly surmised that they were 
now the ones at risk of starvation. The Yuan troops lost their will to 
fight and three days later General Yuan Shao was defeated and killed. 
 
Legendary Era Japan 
 
Japan's ancient hero Yamato Takeru was one of the eighty children of 
Emperor Keiko. One day he was sent to kill a notorious outlaw who 
was such an expert swordsman that all who had gotten in his way were 
killed.  
 
Yamato Takeru did not intend to duel with the bandit and pretended to 
be ignorant of the man's reputation in order to befriend him. They 
became such good friends that they even went swimming together on a 
regular basis.  
 
When Yamato Takeru was assured the bandit harbored no suspicions, 
he was ready to act. One day when they went swimming, he brought 
with him a wooden sword that he hid in his travel kit. They were in the 
habit of racing each other around a small island, but this time while 
they were racing Takeru let the bandit take the lead. Once he was out of 
sight behind the island, Takeru swam back to shore and quickly 
replaced the bandit's sword with the wooden one.  
 
After they had gotten dressed, Takeru turned to the bandit and revealed 
his true purpose. The bandit immediately went for his sword, but the 
wooden sword had become wedged in the scabbard. While he was 
struggling to draw the wooden sword, Takeru took the bandit's head off 
in a single stroke.

Summary 
  
The source of an opponent's strength lies in either wealth, resources, or 
manpower. If in wealth, cause him to incur expenses, if in resources, 
disrupt the lines of distribution, if in manpower, sow discord.
