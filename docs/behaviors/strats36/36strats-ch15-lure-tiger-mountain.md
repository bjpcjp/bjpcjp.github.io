Lure the Tiger Down the Mountain  
With regard to heights, 1j you occupy them before the enemy 
you can wait for the enemy to climb up. But if he has 
occupied them before you, do not follow but retreat and try to 
entice him out. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Never directly attack a well-entrenched opponent. Instead lure him 
away from his stronghold and separate him from his source of strength. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
In the year A.D. 199 Sun Ce had consolidated his newly conquered 
territories in the south and his next goal was the prosperous area of 
Lujiang to the north. However, Lujiang had a professional army and 
was well defended. In addition it also had the advantage of terrain, 
being accessible only through a couple of easily defended passes.

Sun Ce's advisors cautioned against moving directly against such a 
well-entrenched and powerful state so they devised another scheme.  
 
Sun Ce sent an emissary laden with gifts and a letter to the king of 
Lujiang, Liu Xun. The letter praised the king's military skills and 
begged for his assistance. 
 
Sun Ce wrote, "For years the state of Shangliao has invaded my 
territory unhindered and carried away booty, yet we are too weak to 
launch a retaliatory raid. If Your Majesty would attack Shangliao we 
would give assistance and you could annex the state for yourself." 
 
Flattered and covetous of increasing his domains, the king of Lujiang 
disregarded the advice of his counselors and attacked the state of 
Shangliao. Several weeks later, while the king of Lujiang was busy 
laying siege to Shangliao's capital, Sun Ce attacked the almost 
undefended Lujiang and easily seized the capital.  
 
Without the expected support from Sun Ce, The king of Lujiang failed 
to take the capital of Shangliao and he returned only to find his own 
capital already in enemy hands. Sun Ce now had the advantage of the 
Lujiang terrain and the former king could do nothing but flee with his 
army. 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
The first Han emperor, Gaozu, wishing to destroy the growing menace 
of the Xiongnu tribes that had been raiding his northern territories, sent 
spies to report on their condition. Forewarned, the Xiongnu carefully 
concealed their able-bodied men and well-fed horses and allowed only 
old men and emaciated cattle to be seen wandering the countryside.  
 
When the spies returned they all recommended an immediate attack on 
the Xiongnu since it seemed obvious that they were poor and starving. 
 
However, one of the councillors, Lou Qing, became suspicious saying, 
"When two countries go to war they are naturally inclined to make 
ostentatious displays of strength. Yet our spies see only old men and 
deprivation. This is surely a deception on the enemy's part to lure us 
into a trap, and it would be unwise to attack."

 The emperor however disregarded his advice and as predicted they 
were trapped in the city of Pingcheng.  
 
The emperor and his army barely escaped after employing an 
unorthodox strategy of their own (see Chapter 31) 
 
Yuan Dynasty China 
 
Lure the Tiger Down the Mountain was a favorite strategy for the 
Mongol armies since their superior cavalry was better suited to 
attacking field troops then laying siege to fortified positions.  
 
A special unit of the Mongol cavalry known as the Mangudai would 
charge the enemy's front lines and then, apparently beaten back, they 
would feign a disorderly retreat. Deceived into believing that they were 
winning, the opposing army would leave their positions and give chase.  
 
Once the pursuers had been drawn out into a long thin line the Mongols 
would quickly reorganize into two divisions that would split apart in 
opposite directions and circle back to attack the center of the line of 
pursuing soldiers.  
 
After destroying the center and separating the enemy's forces they 
could easily overcome the remaining forces up and down the line. 
 
Summary 
 
It is a rule in warfare to avoid attacking what is hard. When an 
opponent has the advantage of terrain, defensive works, or home 
territory, then he is in a position of strength. Through trickery and 
deception he must be lured away from his advantageous position. Once 
out in the open he will expose weaknesses that can then be attacked.
