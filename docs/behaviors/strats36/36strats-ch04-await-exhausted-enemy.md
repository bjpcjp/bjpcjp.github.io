Await the Exhausted Enemy at Your Ease 
Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the 
enemy will be fresh for the fight, whoever is second in the 
field and has to hasten into formation will fight already 
exhausted. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
It is an advantage to choose the time and place for battle. In this way 
you know when and where the battle will take place, while your enemy 
does not. Encourage your enemy to expend his energy in futile quests 
while you conserve your strength. When he is exhausted and confused, 
you attack with energy and purpose.

In 684 B.C. the state of Qi attacked the state of Lu. When the two 
armies met at Changshao, Duke Zhuang of Lu wanted to beat the drums 
and begin his advance, but he was dissuaded by his chief advisor Cao

Cui who said, "Not yet." Only after the Qi troops had beaten their 
drums three times did Cao cry, "Now is the time to beat ours!" 
 
The Lu troops then charged and defeated the Qi. The duke was eager to 
pursue the retreating Qi troops when he was again stopped by Cao who 
said, "Not yet." Cao then dismounted his chariot and went to inspect the 
tracks made by the retreating Qi troops. When he climbed back aboard 
he said, "All right, let's pursue them." The Qi troops were thus driven 
out of the Lu territory. 
 
After the victory was won the duke asked Cao Cui the reason for his 
actions, to which Cao Cui replied,  
 
"In battle, it is all a matter of morale. The first beating of the drum is to 
rouse the soldiers to action.  
 
If no action is taken, then, at the second beating, their morale begins to 
dwindle, and at the third it is gone. When the enemy was at the end of 
their enthusiasm, we were at the peak of ours. That is the time to 
attack.” 
 
“Because of this we were able to defeat them. But in dealing with 
seasoned generals it is often difficult to see through their tactics. I was 
therefore afraid that they might have made an ambush ready for us.  
 
But when I found that during their retreat their chariot tracks were 
disorderly and their banners discarded, I knew we could chase them 
out." 
 
Spring and Autumn Period China 
 
In 628 B.C. the commander of a Qin division stationed in the capital of 
their ally, the state of Zheng, saw an opportunity to "lead a sheep 
away" and sent a message to his ruler, Duke Mu.  
 
He reported that the Zheng officials had entrusted his division with the 
keys and defence of the north gate, therefore if the duke were to 
secretly send an army, the Qin garrison could attack from inside and 
open the gates, thus easily taking the city.

Duke Mu consulted his advisor, Jian Shu, on his plan to secretly attack 
Zheng and the latter replied,  
 
"I have never heard of wearing out an army attempting to make a 
surprise attack on a distant state.  
 
If our army is worn out and its strength exhausted while the ruler of the 
distant state has prepared for our attack, will the outcome not be 
disaster? 
 
If our army knows where it's going, certainly Zheng will find out as 
well, after traveling a thousand li, who could fail to guess our 
intentions?" 
  
But the Duke ignored this advice and ordered his troops to mobilize. As 
the army rode out the gate they passed the old advisor who stood 
weeping by the roadside. 
 
When asked why he was crying, Jian Shu replied, "I see the army 
marching out and my son with it, but I will see neither return. If Jin (a 
rival kingdom) should decide to intervene they will intercept you at the 
Yao Pass. It is there that I shall go to retrieve your bones." 
 
As the old advisor predicted, Zheng discovered the plot and the Qin 
collaborators fled to distant parts. When the Qin army arrived they 
discovered Zheng well prepared to meet them. Seeing no way to 
capture the capital, the Qin army turned for home stopping along the 
way to wipe out the small state of Hua.  
 
Meanwhile, in the state of ]in , which was an ally of the now defunct 
state of Hua, the commander Yuan Zhen was enraged by the actions of 
Qin. 
 
He said to the king, "Qin has ignored Jian Shu's advice and has worn 
out its people on a mission of greed. Heaven presents us with this 
opportunity, and an opportunity thus presented must not be lost! One 
must not allow the enemy to escape, for to do so means trouble in the 
future. We must attack the Qin army."

The king was persuaded and the order was issued to attack. The Qin 
army was soundly defeated at the Yao Pass. 
 
Chinese Folk Tale 
 
Emperor Xuan of Zhou loved to gamble on cock fights and kept a 
stable of specially bred fighting roosters. Although they were strong 
and fierce they would nevertheless lose against the roosters trained by 
Ji Xingze. The emperor therefore hired Ji to train his roosters.  
 
Ten days had passed when the emperor went to the stables to ask if 
they were ready to fight. 
 
"No," said Ji. "They are far too fierce and proud of their strength. They 
rush to attack even the slightest noise." 
 
After another ten days passed the emperor returned to inquire again. 
"Not yet. They are still haughty and jump at everything that moves."  
 
After another ten days the emperor again asked the question. 
"No, still not yet. Although they no longer rush to attack, they still raise 
their hackles and stare fiercely at the slightest provocation." 
 
After yet another ten days the emperor again asked if the roosters were 
ready. 
 
"Yes, they are nearly ready. Although some still crow from time to time, 
none ever change their countenance. From a distance they appear as 
steady is if they were made of wood. Before them, their untrained 
opponents would not dare accept their challenge and could only turn 
back and run." 
 
Summary 
 
While there are circumstances when it is necessary for an army to hurry 
to the battlefield in order to command the advantage of terrain, or 
weather, it is more often a mistake to rush to battle without a definite 
advantage for doing so.
