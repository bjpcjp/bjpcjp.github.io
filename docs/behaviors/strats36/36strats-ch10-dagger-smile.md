The king of Wei sent a beautiful courtesan to the king of Chu who took 
great delight in the new girl. His queen, Zheng Xiu, knowing how fond 
the king was of his new woman, treated the newcomer as a sister 
supplying her with gifts and treasures and whatever she needed.  
The king, hearing of this, summoned his queen and said, "A woman 
serves a man with her beauty and thus jealousy is a part of her very 
nature. Yet you, knowing how much I am pleased by the new woman, 
have treated her more kindly than I have myself. These actions are 
those of a child to her parents or a minister to his ruler. How 
unexpected it is to find this in a queen to her husband." 
 
The queen thus knew that her husband did not suspect her of jealousy.  
 
When she next met with the new girl the queen told her, "His majesty is 
much taken with your beauty but he dislikes the shape of your nose. 
When next you serve him be sure to cover it with your hand."  
 
Grateful for the advice, when she next served the king this is what she 
did.  
 
The next day the king asked his queen, ''The new woman covers her 
nose when she is with me. Do you know why?" 
 
"I know," replied the queen. 
 
"Well then no matter how unpleasant, you must tell me the reason."  
 
"It seems she does not like the way your majesty smells." 
 
"The shrew!" cried the king. 
 
In a rage the king ordered that the unfortunate girl's nose be cut of

In 342 B.C. General Yang of Qin invaded the state of Wei and laid 
siege to the city of Wu. The king of Wei, already weakened from a

previous battle, was unwilling to face another engagement and asked 
his counselors for advice.  
 
One of his officials, minister Ying, said, "General Yang was originally 
a native of Wei and in our youth he and I were close friends. I therefore 
request to be allowed to go personally to appeal to our friendship and 
try to persuade him into lifting the siege." The king agreed and sent the 
minister to Wu. 
 
When he arrived, minister Ying sent a message asking for a meeting 
outside the city walls in three days to discuss a mutual retreat. When 
general Yang received the message that his old friend was in charge of 
the city's defense and was requesting peace negotiations he readily 
agreed.  
 
Three days later minister Ying left the city and, to show his good faith, 
was accompanied by only three hundred men. General Yang greeted his 
old friend with open arms and invited him and his men to a banquet.  
 
During the celebrations, minister Ying and his men were seized and 
their uniforms taken. Dressed like Wei soldiers, the men of Qin 
marched back to the city and ordered the gates opened. As soon as the 
gates were open they rushed in and seized the city.  
 
The trusting minister Ying was taken back to Qin as captive. 
 
Yuan Dynasty China 
 
In 1320, after the death of emperor Renzong (the great-grandson of 
Kubalai Khan), there followed two years of turmoil in the court over 
who should succeed to the throne. One faction installed the nine-year-
old son of the late emperor, but the new prime minister, seeing an 
opportunity to advance his status, conspired to have the young emperor 
and his supporters massacred.  
 
He then sent for Prince Huai, who had been banished to the south years 
earlier, and installed him on the throne in hopes of manipulating the 
inexperienced ruler. Prince Huai, however, wanted to make his elder 
brother Heshi emperor.

When Prince Heshi received the message that his brother had become 
emperor and wanted to hand the throne to him, he became suspicious 
and refused to go to the capital. 8 In order to assuage his elder brother's 
fears, the young emperor offered to meet him halfway.  
 
Prince Heshi agreed and set out along the road to the capital. When the 
two brothers met along the road they rushed to clasp each other's arms 
with tears in their eyes.  
 
For three days they feasted and drank well into the night. On the 
morning of the fourth day the elder brother, Heshi, emerged alone from 
his brother's tent. The body of the emperor was discovered minutes 
later and Heshi became the new emperor.  
 
 No one ever mentioned the late emperor or his sudden death again. 
 
Summary 
 
In any contest where the stakes are high, kindness and goodwill are 
quickly discarded. To hide sinister intentions behind the facade of 
friendship and loyalty is standard practice in the upper echelons of 
power. Given the history of imperial intrigues, such an offer could not 
do anything but arouse suspicion.
