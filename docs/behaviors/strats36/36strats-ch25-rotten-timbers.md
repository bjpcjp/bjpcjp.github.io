The general is the supporting pillar of the state. If his talents 
are all-encompassing, the state will invariably be strong. If 
the supporting pillar is marked by fissures, the state will 
invariably grow weak. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Disrupt the enemy's formations, interfere with their methods of 
operations, change the rules in which they are used to following, and go 
contrary to their standard training. In this way, you remove the 
supporting pillar, the common link which makes a group of men an 
effective fighting force. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
In 259 B.C., Qin invaded Zhao, the two armies confronting each other 
at Changping. After several skirmishes, the Zhao forces dug in and 
waited behind fortified positions refusing to come out despite daily

taunts from the enemy. Knowing it was futile to lure the Zhao out, and 
that a prolonged stalemate worked in their favor, the Qin general 
schemed to remove the Zhao general leading the defense. 
 
Spies were sent to the Zhao camp to spread the rumor that the one thing 
Qin feared was that Zhao Kuo, son of the famous general Zhao She, 
would be put in charge of the army. When reports of this rumor reached 
the king, he relieved the current commander and replaced him with 
Zhao Kuo.  
 
What the king of Zhao did not know was that years earlier when the 
famous general Zhao She was still alive he had tested his son on the art 
of war and found him wanting. While the son proved knowledgeable in 
all aspects of war, his father still disapproved.  
 
When asked why, he told his wife, "To fight war entails fatal danger, 
but Zhao Kuo passed it off as something easy in his talk. It would be 
better if our king did not appoint him as commander. If he does, he will 
surely be the one to lead our troops to doom." 
 
When Zhao Kuo took over command, he set about restructuring the 
army, reissuing orders and rules, and dismissing many senior officers.  
 
When the Qin general heard of this, he attacked. Using the strategy 
‘Lure the Tiger Down the Mountain’ he faked a retreat. Zhao, 
overconfident and self-assured, assumed the retreat to be real and 
abandoned his fortifications to give chase. The Qin then circled back 
and destroyed the Zhao supply depot. 
 
Forty days later the Zhao troops were starving. Zhao Kuo and his 
personal guard made a last stand against the Qin, but were brought 
down in a hail of arrows.  
 
The Qin general knew that a seasoned general would never fall for such 
an obvious tactic, but playing on the younger general's weakness, he 
succeeded in neutralizing their initial advantage.

Warring States Period China 
 
Almost thirty-one years later, in 228 B.C., Qin was again attacking 
Zhao, but for the last time. During the previous years, Qin had 
continued to expand, eating up smaller kingdoms on its borders. Once a 
mighty state, Zhao had been reduced to bribing Qin with territory as it 
frantically tried to buy time to rebuild its army.  
 
Zhao's only hope lay in the prowess of its leading general, Li Mu, to 
rally the remaining troops and devise some stratagem to save them 
from almost certain annihilation. 
 
The equally famous Qin general Wang Jian schemed to remove the 
pillar of the Zhao state through court intrigue.  
 
Now, it was known that King Yu of Zhao kept a homosexual lover by 
the name of Han Cang to whom he turned for advice in running the 
state. Han Cang was jealous of General Li's acclaim and eagerly 
accepted a bribe from Qin to slander Li, saying he was conspiring with 
Qin to commit treason. 
 
General Li was summoned to court where Han Cang read out the 
charges. "You were seen in the presence of the king with a dagger 
concealed in your sleeve. Thus you must have been plotting 
assassination. The penalty is execution!" 
 
"But what you saw up my sleeve was not the handle of a dagger, but a 
splint for my crippled arm," replied Li Mu. "My left arm is crippled and 
weak. When kneeling at court I have difficulty rising and, since I do not 
wish to cause a distraction before his Majesty, I bound a splint to my 
arm so that I could rise without difficulty." 
 
But Han Cang was not swayed, he said, "My instructions are to have 
you executed without argument. There will be no pardon. However, as 
a concession I will allow you to commit suicide."18 
 
Li Mu bowed gratefully and retired from the audience chamber to fall 
upon his sword. However, his crippled arm would not extend far

enough to allow him to hold the tip to his belly, so he placed the sword 
in his mouth, dashed against a pillar, and killed himself.  
 
Five months later Qin attacked and Zhao was destroyed forever. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
In the year 383, Emperor Fu Jian of Qin personally led a cavalry of 
five thousand mounted soldiers to attack General Xie Shi of Jin.  
 
Discovering that the Jin forces were greater than he anticipated, the 
emperor had his army form defensive positions along the bank of the 
river. The Jin armies likewise encamped on the opposite side. Neither 
side wished to cross first, since it was well known that an army is most 
vulnerable when crossing a river. 
 
General Shi sent an envoy across the river with a message that read, 
"My lord, your army has entered deeply into our territory, and in 
deploying your ranks you have crowded upon the river. This is the plan 
for a lengthy stalemate. Do you really want to fight? If you will order 
your men to withdraw to a safe distance and allow us to cross we can 
then fight it out and settle the matter quickly." 
 
The emperor agreed to the request. When his advisors objected, 
Emperor Fu Jian told them that he planned to turn his army about and 
attack the Jin after half their troops had crossed.  
 
But General Xie anticipated the emperor's treachery and sent scouts 
disguised as imperial troops to infiltrate the Qin ranks. When the 
emperor ordered his army to pull back, the disguised Jin troops began 
to incite panic by spreading the rumor that Qin was withdrawing in 
defeat and that Jin was in hot pursuit. The retreat quickly turned into a 
rout as the Qin troops broke formation to escape. 
  
The emperor and his generals raced frantically after the fleeing soldiers 
with whips in hand to stop them, but to no avail. The Jin army quickly 
crossed the river and pursued the Qin forces, inflicting enormous 
casualties. The emperor was wounded and narrowly escaped. He was 
captured and strangled a few weeks later

Summary 
 
Commanding a large body of men is like dealing with an unthinking 
beast: its actions are not determined so much by what is logical as by 
circumstance of terrain and habit. An army that is invincible in a certain 
formation can be useless if that formation is broken. By changing the 
rules and habits under which the enemy is used to fighting, you take 
away his physical and moral foundation.
