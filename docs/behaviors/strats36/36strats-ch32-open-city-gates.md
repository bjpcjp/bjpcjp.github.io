The Strategy Of Open City Gates 
One who excels as a war, does not appear formidable; One 
who excels in defeating the enemy does not join issue. This is 
known as the virtue of non-contention. 
 
Lao Zi, Tao Te Ching 
 
When the enemy is superior in numbers and your situation is such that 
you expect to be overrun at any moment, then drop all pretense of 
military preparedness and act casually.  
 
Unless the enemy has an accurate description of your situation, this 
unusual behavior will arouse suspicions. With luck he will be 
dissuaded from attacking. 23 
 
                                                      
23 This is the strategy of reverse psychology.Since Sun Zi’s axiom “Appear 
strong weak…” was so universally understood,most commanders will assume 
that by appearing weak, you are actually strong and are simply baiting  a trap.

Han Dynasty China 
 
In 166 B.C. General Li Cuang of the Han dynasty was out on patrol 
with a hundred cavalrymen when they spotted three Xiongnu horsemen 
on a scouting patrol. The Han cavalry gave chase killing two and 
capturing the third. On their return to their main camp they were 
spotted by several thousand Xiongnu horsemen in the distance. 
 
The troop commanders were all for making a run for it, but Li Cuang 
knew they could never outride thousands of horsemen over a hundred 
kilometers to reach their main army. Instead of running away, Li Cuang 
ordered his men to advance towards the enemy until they were within 
two kilometers. Then he ordered them to stop out in the open and 
dismount. He further ordered that all the horses be unsaddled and the 
men to relax and lie down in the grass. 
 
The Xiongnu sent scouts to investigate but Li Cuang sent a few of his 
men out to chase them away. Watching from a distance, the Xiongnu 
commanders suspected that the Han patrol was a decoy and the rest of 
the army lay somewhere nearby waiting in ambush.  
 
The Xiongnu decided to stay and watch from a distance. That night 
they heard the Han soldiers singing and drinking, certainly not making 
any effort to escape. This seemed to convince the Xiongnu that the Han 
were using a clever ruse in order to launch a surprise night attack.  
 
The next morning Li Cuang and his men discovered the Xiongnu had 
disappeared and they were able to leisurely make their way back to the 
main camp. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
In 149 B.C. the famous strategist Kong Ming of Shu, wishing to attack 
the state of Wei, sent an advance force to scout for the enemy. Leading 
the army of Wei was Sima Yi who also sent an advance force of fifty 
thousand troops. The two vanguards met and engaged in battle, but the 
Wei forces were superior and won the day. 
 
The defeated Shu vanguard raced back to the main body of Kong 
Ming's army whose troops, seeing the look of fear in the faces of their

comrades, thought that the enemy was upon them, and fled in panic. 
Kong Ming and a few bodyguards fled to the city of Yangping with the 
Wei army in hot pursuit. 
 
Vastly outnumbered and unable to either retreat or sustain a siege, 
Kong Ming played a last resort strategy that made him famous 
throughout China. He removed all the guards and battle flags from the 
walls and had all four of the city gates flung open. When Sima Yi 
approached the city he could see only a few old men nonchalantly 
sweeping the grounds within the gates. Kong Ming was seen sitting in 
one of the towers smiling and playing his lute. 
 
Sima Yi remarked to his advisors, "That man seems to be too happy for 
my comfort. Doubtless he has some deep laid scheme in mind to bring 
us all to disaster." As they stood spellbound, the strains of Kong 
Ming's lute reached their ears, and this only heightened their sense of 
foreboding. 
 
Such peculiar behavior was too suspicious. Fearing a clever trap, Sima 
Yi turned his army back and retreated. After the army left, Kong Ming 
and his remaining troops departed in the opposite direction and made 
their way safely back to their capital. 
 
Hojo Regency Japan 
 
During the battle of Mikatagahara in 1572, the Takeda army, led by 
Takeda Shingen, was planning to lay siege to Hamamatsu castle 
belonging to Tokugawa leyasu. To avoid being besieged and starved 
out by the vastly superior Takeda army, lyasu prepared defensive 
positions three kilometers away in order to engage the Takeda before 
they could reach the castle. The battle was fiercely fought throughout 
the day, but by nightfall, the Tokugawa forces were exhausted and were 
retreating for the castle with the Takeda giving chase. 
 
The commander of the castle wanted to close and bolt the city gates, 
but lyasu interrupted him saying, "Closing the gates is exactly what 
Shingen is expecting. Then our remaining troops would be left out in 
the open where they would be hunted down one by one."

Tokugawa ordered that the gates be left open and a huge brazier lit in 
front of the gates to guide the fleeing soldiers through the dark 
countryside. In addition, he ordered a large war drum to be beaten so 
that his troops could follow the sound until they saw the beacon. 
 
When the Takeda forces arrived at the castle to see the gates open and a 
brazier burning in front, Shingen immediately suspected a trap and 
ordered his troops to pull back.  
 
In this way leyasu was able to prevent the Takeda from attacking while 
allowing his remaining forces to find their way back to the safety of the 
castle. 
 
Summary 
 
In a desperate situation, often the only recourse is to do something 
completely unexpected. Unusual behavior in a time of crises arouses 
suspicions and doubts. Placing doubt in your enemy's mind means he is 
already half defeated. However, this strategy requires supreme self- 
control. Those nervous about the chances for failure will, by their 
actions, give away the bluff.
