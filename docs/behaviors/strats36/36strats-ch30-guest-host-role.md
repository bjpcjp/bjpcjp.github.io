Exchange The Role Of Guest For That Of Host 
The strategists have a saying: I dare not play the host, but 
play the guest, I dare not advance an inch, but retreat a foot 
instead. This is known as marching forward when there is no 
road, rolling up ones sleeve when there is no arm, dragging 
ones adversary by force when there is no adversary, and 
taking up arms when there are no arms. 
 
Lao Zi, The Tao Te Ching 
 
Defeat the enemy from within by infiltrating the enemy's camp under 
the guise of cooperation, surrender, or peace treaties. In this way, you 
can discover his weakness and then, when the enemy's guard is relaxed, 
strike directly at the source of his strength. 
 
Qin Dynasty China 
 
Xiang Liang came from a long line of Chu generals but the family lost 
power when the state of Chu was defeated and annexed by Qin. In his

youth he had killed a man and escaped with his nephew Xiang Yu to the 
state of Wu requesting asylum from the governor. The governor 
welcomed Xiang Liang and gave him an administrative position. 
 
During this time, Xiang secretly formed a band of guests and retainers 
and trained them in the art of war while establishing a reputation as a 
competent leader. Then in 209 B.C., the various states and kingdoms 
rose up in open revolt against the oppressive Qin dynasty. When word 
of the revolt reached Wu, the governor saw an opportunity to improve 
his position by joining the rebellion. 
 
He called Xiang Liang and said, "All regions west of the Yangtze River 
are in revolt. The time has come when heaven will destroy the house of 
Qin.  
 
I have heard it said that "He who takes the lead may rule others, but he 
who lags behind will be ruled by others." I would like to dispatch an 
army with you and your nephew at the head." 
 
Xiang Liang, who took the advice in a way the governor would regret, 
said, "This is a great honor you have bestowed on my family and I beg 
leave to call in my nephew Yu, so that he may receive your orders 
directly." 
 
The governor consented. Xiang Liang went to summon his nephew and 
secretly gave him instructions to hold his sword in readiness. They 
returned to the governor and after some time Xiang Liang turned to his 
nephew and said, "You may proceed!" 
 
This was the signal, and without hesitation Yu drew his sword and cut 
off the governor's head in a single stroke. Xiang Liang then picked up 
the head, removed the governor's seals of office, and declared himself 
governor.  
 
The few attendants that objected were quickly attacked and killed by 
Yu so that no one else dared to oppose the appointment. Xiang Liang 
went on to rally several armies to his side in revolt against the Qin.

After numerous victories he re-conquered his home state of Chu and 
became a contender for the emperor's throne before being killed in 
battle against another rival for the empire. 
 
Han Dynasty China 
  
In 180 B.C. empress Lu, the wife of the first Han emperor, passed away. 
For years after her husband's death she had held power, supplanting the 
authority of the late emperor's Liu clan with her own family, the Lu. 
Upon her death the Liu family plotted to reclaim their control over the 
empire. 
 
One of the few remaining members of the Liu clan who had escaped 
the empress's purge still held a high position as the king of Qi. He 
received a secret message asking him to raise his troops and march on 
the capital of Chang'an where he would be assisted by other Liu 
supporters from within.  
 
The king of Qi ordered his general, Wei Po, to secretly ready the army 
for mobilization, but the prime minister of Qi (a member of the Lu clan) 
learned of the king's intentions. He intercepted the general's orders and, 
using the imperial seals in his possession, ordered the army to surround 
the king's palace and keep him prisoner until further instructions 
arrived from the capital.21 
 
General Wei Po went to speak with the prime minister, pretending that 
he had no involvement or knowledge of the king's plot, and said, "Even 
though the king wants to send out his troops, he cannot since he does 
not possess the Tiger Seals22  of the Han court which would give him 
authority to do so. I beg you allow me to take command of the troops 
for you and keep the king under guard!" 
                                                      
21 The prime minister was appointed by the court, to watch over the conductof 
the king.

‘male and female’ that fit together to make a whole. The king would keep one 
half and his commanders the other. A courier bearing orders would be given 
the king’s half. A commander, upon receiving the orders, would check that the 
couriers’ half and hist own fit together thus insuring the orders were genuine.

The prime minister, believing that Wei Po was on his side, handed over 
the seals, and put him in charge of the troops. But as soon as he had 
taken command, Wei Po had the troops surround the prime minister's 
offices instead. 
 
"Alas!" said the prime minister. 'The Daoists have a saying: 'Strike 
when the hour comes, or suffer the ruin that follows." This then is what 
they meant!"  
The prime minister then committed suicide. The remaining members of 
the Liu clan rose up in revolt and destroyed the entire Lu family. 
 
Ming Dynasty China 
 
During the Ming dynasty, in the Songjiang region, there lived a wealthy 
man known as Rich Man Pan. As rich as Pan was, he was always 
hungry for more and sought out every opportunity to make money. 
Having heard about alchemy Pan became obsessed with the idea of 
turning lead into gold and went to great expense inviting wandering 
sages and alchemists to his house to teach him the secret. Yet after 
more than ten years of experiments, Pan was still unable to convert 
even a gram of lead into gold. 
 
Meanwhile, Pan's interest in alchemy became known far and wide. One 
year Pan went on vacation in the luxurious resort town of West Lake 
just outside of Hangzhao. Pan's villa was large and sumptuous, but next 
door was an even grander villa. Over the weeks, Pan observed his 
neighbor who appeared to be fabulously wealthy and who was 
accompanied by a stunningly attractive young woman. Pan contrived to 
meet this elegant stranger, and over the weeks they became acquainted. 
 
The man's name was Jia Wuzhi and Pan was anxious to find out the 
source of his wealth. After discreet questioning, Jia told Pan that he 
was an alchemist. Pan was stunned and told him of his own efforts in 
that field. Pan doubted that it was possible after all, but Jia chided his 
lack of faith and as a matter of honor offered to demonstrate his 
technique. 
  
He brought out a tripod which he set over a fire. Cradled on the tripod 
was a porcelain dish containing what appeared to be common lead. Jia

heated the dish until the lead melted then, removing a silk bag from his 
person, he scooped out a small amount of black powder and mixed this 
with the molten lead. The lead instantly transformed into valuable 
silver. 
 
Pan was astonished and asked him how it was done. Jia explained that 
the process was long and costly but once the powder, called the "silver 
breeder," was produced, it would transform enough lead into silver to 
make Pan the wealthiest man in China. Pan explained that he already 
had a laboratory set up at his home and he begged Jia to be his guest 
there and help him to create the silver breeder. 
 
"Well, since you have already studied the art yourself, it may be all 
right. But be warned that the rules are strict and I will only show you 
the process once." said the alchemist. 
 
When Jia and his beautiful wife arrived, Pan was stricken by the 
woman's beauty. Jia explained that the more silver used, the greater the 
potency, so Pan bought as much silver as he could get hold of, over 
four thousand Taels. The next day they began. Jia explained that the 
process was one of purification and refinement and that both he and 
Pan must wash, fast, and avoid any activity that was impure. Most 
important, only he and Pan could enter the sacred area to attend the fire. 
But, in case of emergency, Jia's wife could substitute since she was 
specially trained for this job. 
 
The process would take eighty-one days to complete. Pan was warned 
not to look into the covered cauldron before the final day. A few days 
later a message arrived informing Jia that his mother was ill and that 
she requested his presence at her deathbed. Jia explained the situation 
to Pan who was deeply concerned about the silver breeder, but Jia 
reassured him saying he would leave his wife behind to oversee the 
process. 
 
After Jia left, Pan grew ever more lustful for the alchemist's wife. One 
night in a fit of passion he seduced her in the sacred chamber. On the 
eighty first day, Jia returned and he and Pan went to inspect the boiler, 
but as soon as Jia opened the lid his facial expression turned to anger.

"What has happened to the silver breeder?" he shouted. "Has anyone 
done anything here that could have affected the purity of the 
atmosphere?" 
 
Pan was shocked into silence. The alchemist summoned his wife and 
angrily asked her if anything had occurred in the room while he was 
gone. At first, she denied everything, but after Jia grabbed a whip and 
threatened to beat her with it she confessed to the seduction. 
 
Jia was furious, he turned to Pan and said, "You greedy scoundrel! With 
all your money you could buy as many wives as you want, but you still 
wanted to defile my wife. Well, you have your just reward since the 
silver breeder has all evaporated. And I will never show you the secret 
now." 
 
Whereupon the alchemist and his wife left, ignoring Pan's pleas for 
forgiveness. 
 
Two years later the still brooding, Pan returned to the West Lake area, 
but under more modest conditions. There, one day he spotted a woman 
who looked like the alchemist's wife. He questioned her and she did 
indeed recognize him.  
 
Pan asked about her husband and the woman replied, "Oh, I was never 
married. I was hired for three months to pretend to be the wife of an 
alchemist, but now I am working for another alchemist who is at this 
moment meeting with his new client." 
 
Japanese Folk Tale 
 
In feudal Japan, there lived a venerable kendo master who decided to 
test his three highest ranking students. He brought them one by one to 
an old temple in the nearby mountains where he told each student, "You 
have studied with me many years, now let's see if my teaching has been 
in vain. There, within the temple, awaits your test. Pass and you will 
have graduated." 
 
Within the dimly lit temple, the Master had hidden four samurai armed 
with clubs and instructions to jump anyone who entered the temple.

The first student entered the temple and, before his eyes could adjust to 
the light, he was surprised and beaten by the samurai.  
 
"I am sorry, you have failed," said the master. 
 
The second student entered the temple and sensed the attackers. He was 
able to deftly evade their attack and defeat them. The student came out 
of the temple triumphant, but again the master said, "I am sorry, you 
have failed." 
Finally, the third student was brought to the temple and told about the 
test. The student replied, "But venerable master, protocol dictates that 
when entering a temple the master must always precede the student, so 
if you please, I shall follow you in." 
 
To which the master replied, "You rascal! You have learned all I can 
teach you."  
 
Summary 
 
When you are weak but your enemy is strong there is no chance for 
victory in a direct contest. Instead, by assuming a subordinate position, 
you may have the chance of undermining and subverting your enemy's 
power.
