To Catch Something, First Let It Go 
Do not obstruct an army retreating homeward. If you besiege 
an army you must leave an outlet. Do not press an exhausted 
invader. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Cornered prey will often mount a final desperate attack. To prevent this 
you let the enemy believe he still has a chance for freedom. His will to 
fight is thus dampened by his desire to escape.  
 
When in the end the freedom is proven a falsehood the enemy's morale 
will be defeated and he will surrender without a fight. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 506 B.C. an alliance of states headed by Wu overran and defeated 
the army of Chu. The remaining Chu troops were in retreat.

The king of Wu wanted to pursue and destroy the fleeing army but was 
held back by his younger brother Fu Gai who said, "A cornered beast 
will fight to the finish, how much more an army of warriors. If they 
know there's no escape and they must fight to the death, they are bound 
to overpower us. However, if we allow them to reach and cross the 
river then, once in their home territory, they will think only of escaping 
the field." 
 
The king followed his brother's advice and allowed the Chu army to 
cross the river. Once on the other side, the Chu soldiers began 
preparing food since they had not eaten in a long time. When the Wu 
army finally arrived on the opposite shore, the Chu soldiers abandoned 
their cooking fires and scattered into the countryside. The Wu army 
followed after and easily conquered the Chu capital of Yingdu. 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
The Han general, Zhao Zhongguo, was sent to conduct a campaign to 
drive out a tribe of Xianling barbarians who had invaded the western 
provinces.  
 
By the time general arrived in the area the Xianling had been pillaging 
for months and were negligent and lax in their guard. They were no 
longer in the mood to fight and were intent on making off with their 
booty.  
 
When they saw the great Han army approaching from a distance, they 
panicked, abandoned their baggage train, and withdrew towards the 
Huang River. Their route of retreat was narrow and constricted, so 
general Zhao proceeded slowly.  
 
Some of his commanders were eager to close in fast on the retreating 
tribesmen, but Zhao said, 'These impoverished invaders cannot be 
hastily pursued. If we proceed slowly they will depart without paying 
much attention to us; if too quickly, they will turn about and fight to the 
death." 
 
His commanders half-heartily agreed.

The Xianling, seeing in the lax pursuit an opportunity to escape 
unharmed, dashed madly into the Huang River to flee. Several hundred 
drowned, while the remainder threw down their weapons and scattered 
into the countryside.  
 
Thus without engaging in battle or suffering any casualties, General 
Zhao succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties and completely routing 
the enemy. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
  
In A.D. 384 a district administrator named Hong allied himself with the 
local tribes and rose up in arms against the emperor of the Former Qin.  
 
The emperor sent General Fu to quell the rebellion. General Fu was 
renowned as being a fierce commander who showed no pity for either 
the enemy or his own troops. When the rebel Hong heard that general 
Fu was leading the army against him he prepared to flee the state. 
General Fu drove his soldiers fast in order to intercept Hong and 
prevent him from escaping. 
 
One of General Fu's advisors said, "Hong and his tribesman have a 
mind to go home. It behoves us to allow them to escape beyond the pass 
rather than obstruct them." 
 
But General Fu did not agree with this advice and urged his men on 
even faster. He finally caught up to Hong and his tribesmen at the Hua 
Marsh. There Hong and his men were on desperate ground and turned 
to fight.  
 
Because of the entangling terrain, General Fu could not make effective 
use of his superior numbers, while Hong's tribesmen were determined 
to fight to the death. The result was that the Qin forces suffered an 
unexpected defeat and General Fu was killed. Hong went on to carve 
out his own autonomous kingdom that remained free from imperial rule 
until his death.

Six Dynasties Period China 
 
During the Southern Song period General Tan Daoji launched an attack 
against the north on behalf of the emperor. Throughout the campaign 
he seized cities and destroyed fortifications, taking more than four 
thousand prisoners. His advisors suggested that he should execute them 
all and erect a victory mound with the dead.  
 
Tan Daoji replied, "At this time we have attacked the guilty and 
consoled the people. The army of a true king takes the upright as its 
position, so why is it necessary to slay the people?"  
 
He released all the prisoners and sent them back to their homes. These 
former prisoners told their kinsmen of their capture and release and of 
the fair treatment they received at the hands of general Tan. Thereupon 
the barbarians dwelling in the region were elated, and wherever general 
Tan went a great many came forward to give their allegiance to the 
emperor. 
 
Summary 
 
Sun Zi wrote that if you place your troops in a desperate situation they 
will fight for their lives. When the advantage of power lies in your 
favour you must beware not to place the enemy's forces in a position 
where they will fight to the end against you. By allowing the possibility 
of escape you undermine the moral basis for a last ditch battle.
