Fool the Emperor to Cross the Sea 
In conflicts that involve large numbers of people, it is 
possible to get the opponent to become lax in their guard.  
 
When they are in a state of agitation and show signs of 
impatience, appear as if nothing is bothering you and put 
forth an easygoing, relaxed stance.  
 
When you perceive that the mood has been transferred (to 
your opponent), you have a chance to achieve victory by 
making a strong attack with as much speed as possible.

an enemy's guard you must act in the open, hiding your true intentions 
under the guise of common every day activities.1

In 225 B.C. the state of Qin, having slowly increased its power over the 
past hundred years, now felt powerful enough to overcome its 
remaining opponents in open aggression. The most powerful of the 
remaining states was Chu.  
 
The king of Qin sent his renowned general Wang Jian to attack and 
conquer Chu. A year earlier Qin had sent another general, Li Xing, who 
suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Chu.  
 
The older and more experienced general Wang Jian wasn't going to 
make the same mistake as his predecessor and decided against invading 
the country directly. Instead, he stopped just inside Qin's border with 
Chu and built a fortified stockade. The king of Chu called upon his 
allies to muster all available troops and rush them to the opposite side 
of the border. 
 
Confident from their previous victory, the Chu commanders rode out 
each day to challenge Wang to come out and fight, but Wang ignored 
the taunts. Instead, Wang was observed swimming with his men in 
nearby rivers and lakes, or on leisurely picnics in the forest. At night 
there was feasting with singing and dancing. In addition, Wang focused 
his efforts on improving the morale and training of his troops. 
                                                      
1 The origin of this strategy is said to come from an incident involving the 
Tang Dynasty emperor Tai Zhong. The emperor was on campaign against the 
Koreans. His grneral advised crossing the Yellow Sea to the Korean 
Penninsula so that they would be able to surprise the Koreans from behind 
their lines. The plan had only one flaw - the emperor deathly afraid of large 
bodies of water. The generals divised a scheme where the decorated a large 
ship like a country estate and had banners hung all roundso that you could not 
see the ocean. Then theytold the emperor that a local aristocrat cordially 
invited the emperor to dine at his estate. Oncce aboard, the emperor was dined 
and entertained throughout the night while the ship silently set sail. The next 
morning they arrived at their destination with the emperor none the wiser.

After several months, the Chu army was beginning to grow weary of 
the game. One of the Chu commanders said, "Wang Jian has been sent 
to attack Chu, but it seems he is getting too old and he no longer has 
the heart for it. It is obvious that he has no intention of attacking, but is 
here merely to save face." Others agreed and many of the troops were 
sent back to their countries. 
 
Wang Jian had waited behind his stockade almost an entire year before 
the last of the Chu troops also gave up waiting for his attack and broke 
camp to return to the capital. It was then that Wang ordered his men to 
suddenly sally forth and attack the retreating Chu. Because a retreating 
army is vulnerable to attack, coupled with the element of surprise, the 
Chu suffered severe losses and its general was slain.  
 
The king of Chu wasn't able to reassemble all his remaining troops in 
time, as Wang Jian swiftly invaded and conquered the entire kingdom. 
Four years later the king of Qin became the first emperor of China, Qin 
Shihuangdi.

General Li Mu was given the command responsible for defending 
Yanmen against the Xiongnu (Nomadic horsemen that occupied the 
central Asian steppes to the north and west of China.) who were 
constantly raiding the territories.  
 
When Li Mu first arrived at his new command, everyone expected him 
to begin by launching attacks on the local tribes. But he did no such 
thing. Instead, he focused his efforts on training and nurturing the 
border troops, ensuring they were well fed and paid. He further ordered 
that, should the Xiongnu attack, all troops were to retreat into one of 
the fortified towns that were scattered throughout the countryside and 
merely defend. Under no circumstances were they to engage the enemy. 
 
For years, anytime a Xiongnu raiding party entered the territory they 
found the people and soldiers already holed-up behind defensive walls 
with precious little left in the countryside to plunder. Eventually the 
Xiongnu and even Li Mu's own soldiers thought that, though he was a 
virtuous commander, he was also a coward. The border troops, after 
years of training without engaging in battle, became restless for combat.

When Li Mu saw the eagerness for battle amongst his troops, he 
decided to act. First, he sent his best troops to set up an ambush several 
days march away. Then he had herds of cattle and their drivers released 
to graze in the fields with only a few soldiers to watch over them.  
 
When a Xiongnu raiding party happened upon the cattle, they attacked 
and sent the soldiers fleeing. The raiding party sent word back to their 
Khan that the Chinese had abandoned the country leaving herds of 
cattle and lightly defended villages behind.  
 
The Khan raised a tremendous host to invade the Chinese territory. 
Expecting no resistance from the 'cowardly' Li Mu, they were easily led 
into the ambush. More than a hundred thousand Xiongnu horsemen 
were killed. For ten years thereafter, not a single raiding party dared 
cross the border. 
 
Japanese Folk Tale 
 
There once lived a samurai who was plagued by a large and clever rat 
who had the run of the house. This annoyed the samurai to no end so he 
went to the village to buy a cat. A street vendor sold him a cat that he 
said would catch the rat, and indeed the cat looked trim and fit. But the 
rat was even quicker than the cat and after a week with no success the 
samurai returned the cat. This time the vendor pulled out a large and 
grizzled cat and guaranteed that no rat could escape this master mouser. 
 
The rat knew enough to stay clear of this tough alley cat, but when the 
cat slept, the rat ran about. Half the day the rat would hide, but the 
other half he again had the run of the place. The samurai brought the 
cat back to the vendor who shook his head in despair saying he had 
given the samurai his best cat and there was nothing more he could do.  
 
Returning home with his money, the samurai happened upon a monk 
and sought his advice. After hearing the samurai's story the monk 
offered him the services of the cat that lived in the temple. The cat was 
old and fat and he scarcely seemed to notice when he was carried away 
by the doubtful samurai. 
 
For two weeks, the cat did little more than sleep all day and night. The 
samurai wanted to give the cat back to the temple but the monk insisted

he keep him a while longer assuring him the rat's days were close to an 
end. 
 
The rat became accustomed to the presence of the lazy old cat and was 
soon up to his old tricks even, on occasion, brazenly dancing around 
the old cat as he slept. Then one day, as the rat went about his business 
without any concern, he passed close by the cat who swiftly struck out 
his paw and pinned the rat to the floor. 
  
The rat died instantly.  
 
Summary 
 
In battle, the element of surprise is paramount. A wary opponent is 
unlikely to fall into the usual traps, so he must first be made to relax his 
vigilance. To do this one must carry on as though nothing untoward 
was afoot. 
 
Once acclimatized to often repeated actions, a person no longer takes 
notice of them.2 When the enemy ceases to pay attention to you, the 
time is right to attack. 
 
 
                                                      
2 In psychology this phenominom is known as habituation; the more often you 
are exposed to a stimulation, the less sensitive you become to it.
