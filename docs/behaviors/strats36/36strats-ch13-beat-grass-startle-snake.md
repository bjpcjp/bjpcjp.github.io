Agitate him and ascertain the pattern of his movements. 
Determine his disposition and so ascertain the field of battle. 
Probe him and learn where his strength is abundant and 
where deficient. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
When no matter what you do you are unable to determine the 
enemy's situation, pretend that you are going to attack 
fiercely, and you will learn the enemy's plan. When you know 
the enemy's plan, it will be easy to gain victory. 
 
Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings 
 
When you cannot detect the opponent's plans launch a direct, but brief, 
attack and observe your opponent's reactions. His behaviour will reveal 
his strategy.

Song Dynasty China 
 
One day, in the county of Jianzhou, there was a man who lost a 
precious object. The local magistrate, Chen Shuku, was called in to 
investigate. He questioned several people, but no one could tell him 
who the thief was. So, Magistrate Chen laid a trap for those he 
suspected. 
 
"I know of a temple," he told them, "whose bell has great spiritual 
power that can tell a thief from an honest man. Since my investigation 
is at a standstill we must employ the supernatural powers of the bell to 
solve the matter." 
 
The magistrate had the bell brought to the courthouse and displayed in 
the rear chamber. Then he had the suspects brought in to testify to their 
guilt or innocence. He explained to them that if an innocent man 
touched the bell it would remain silent, but if a guilty man touched the 
bell it would ring out. After lighting incense and chanting prayers, the 
magistrate had curtains erected around the bell. 
 
Previously he had instructed one of his assistants to secretly smear ink 
on the bell after the curtains were closed. Each suspect was then told to 
place his hand through the curtain and touch the bell. As they withdrew 
their hands Chen would examine them. Everyone's hands were stained 
except those of one man, who confessed to the theft. He did not touch 
the bell for fear it would ring. 
 
Qin Dynasty 
 
The notorious eunuch Zhao Gao is credited with helping to bring down 
the house of Qin, ending China's first and shortest imperial dynasty.  
After the first emperor died, Zhao Gao conspired with the chief 
minister Li Si to dispose of the legitimate heir to the throne and install a 
weak and corrupt puppet emperor, Huhei (see Chapter 14). 
 
Having established his influence over the young emperor, Zhao Gao 
was nervous about possible opposition from the other ministers of state. 
So he devised a test to see which ones would be faithful to him. One 
day he brought a stag into the court and presented it to the emperor 
explaining that it was a horse.

 "You're mistaken, Prime Minister," said the emperor." You've called a 
stag a horse." 
 
Zhao Gao turned to the other ministers present and asked them whether 
it was a horse or a stag. Some kept silent. Others, in an attempt to 
ingratiate themselves with the true power behind the throne, agreed it 
was a horse. And still others said it was a stag. The emperor was under 
Zhao Gao's control to such a degree that he believed he was going 
insane and that the stag really was a horse. 
 
Meanwhile, one of Zhao Gao's spies was recording the answers given 
by each of the ministers. Afterwards, Zhao Gao secretly framed charges 
against all those who had said it was a stag and had them executed. 
 
Momoyama Period Japan 
 
After almost two centuries of civil war Japan was brought under the 
military control of one man, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but he died eight 
years later leaving a five year-old heir.  
 
The Daimyo who had served under Hideyoshi split into two camps: 
those who supported the heir led by Ishida Mitsunari, and those who 
secretly supported Tokugawa leyasu. For two years tensions between 
the two camps increased as the remaining Daimyo9 chose which side to 
support in the inevitable showdown. 
 
In 1600 the two camps met near the small village of Sekigahara and 
fought what has come to be known as the last great samurai battle.  
 
Those supporting Ishida and the heir apparent numbered eighty 
thousand, while the Tokugawa army numbered seventy-five thousand. 
The two armies formed battle lines among the rolling hills with neither 
side having the advantage of terrain. 
 
However, positioned on some hills overlooking the flanks of both 
armies were troops led by Kobayakawa Hideaki, an ally of Ishida.  
Hideaki's position was a serious threat to the Tokugawa left flank. Yet 
when the battle began, the Tokugawa forces did not attack them, nor

did Hideaki charge down on the Tokugawa. As the battle raged on 
neither side appeared to be gaining the upper hand so Ishida signalled 
Hideaki to make his attack, but no attack came. Ishida then signalled 
frantically and sent messengers urging Hideaki to attack but he still 
refused to move. 
 
Tokugawa was also concerned about Hideaki's refusal to enter the fray 
since he had secretly agreed to betray Ishida during the heat of battle. It 
became apparent to Tokugawa that Hideaki was going to use the 
strategy Waiting at Horagatoge (see Chapter 9) and join in with the 
winning team after the battle was won.  
 
Tokugawa ordered a detachment of harquebusiers to charge up the hill 
and fire on Hideaki's troops. This forced Hideaki into action since he 
could no longer sit passively observing.  
 
He honoured his secret agreement with Tokugawa and charged down 
on the flank of his former ally Ishida. Hideaki's defection helped turn 
the tide of battle. The Tokugawa forces prevailed and leyasu went on to 
become Shogun and found the Tokugawa dynasty. 
 
Summary 
 
A seasoned warrior knows this strategy well and will not reveal his true 
intentions. But the inexperienced, nervous of making a mistake in such 
a high stakes game, will overreact to feints and will thus reveal their 
weakness.
