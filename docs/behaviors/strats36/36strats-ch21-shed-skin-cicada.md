Although it does not mindfully keep guard, in the small 
mountain fields, the scarecrow does not stand in vain.

When you are in danger of being defeated, and your only chance is to 
escape and regroup, then create an illusion. While the enemy's attention 
is focused on this artifice, secretly remove your men leaving behind 
only the facade of your presence. 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
In 204 B.C. the king of Han, Gaozu, after escaping his exile through the 
use of the strategy ‘Openly Repair the Walkway, Secretly March to 
Chencang’ (see Chapter 8), suffered several defeats at the hands of his 
old nemesis, the warlord of Chu, Xiang Yu.

Outnumbered and defeated, Gaozu fled with his remaining troops to 
Zhongyang where he fortified the city and prepared to make a counter 
attack. Xiang Yu, however, laid siege to the city cutting Gaozu's supply 
lines and avenue of escape. 
 
One of Gaozu's commanders, Ji Xin, devised a scheme to escape, he 
said, "The situation is very grave. I beg you to let me deceive Xiang Yu 
for you by taking your place as king. In this way you will be able to slip 
away in secret." 
 
Gaozu agreed and, while he prepared his escape, Ji Xin had two 
thousand women from the city dressed like Han soldiers. Before dawn, 
he had the women march out the front gate and form battle lines. The 
army of Xiang Yu rushed to formation expecting a final showdown 
with Han. 
 
As the first light of dawn began to break, Ji Xin rode forth in the yellow 
draped imperial carriage of the king and announced to the Chu army, 
"The food in the city is exhausted. The king of Han surrenders!" 
 
While the army of Chu was celebrating their victory, the king of Han 
and thirty horsemen slipped quietly out of the city. When Xiang Yu 
learned of the deception he had General Ji Xin burned to death. The 
king of Han made good his escape and two years later returned at the 
head of a new army. This time he was victorious while the defeated 
Xiang Yu was hunted down. 
 
The final scene in Xiang Yu's life is one of the most poignant in China's 
history. Xiang Yu had fled to the bank of the Yellow River with a Han 
detachment hot on his heels. He was alone since every one of his 
commanders were now dead or had turned traitor. There was a 
ferryman who recognized the great general of Chu and urged him to 
cross over the river before the Han troops arrived. 
 
But Xiang Yu refused saying, "I left with the sons and fathers and 
husbands of Chu, but to return alone without them, how could I face 
the people with such shame."  
 
Instead he paid the ferryman to take his favorite stallion across and free 
him on the other side. By this time the Han soldiers had arrived and,

spotting an old comrade among the troops, Xiang Yu called out, "I hear 
there is a reward for my head. Since you were a friend of mine I give 
you this parting gift!"  
 
And with that he drew his sword and cut his throat. The Han soldiers 
rushed to retrieve his head and in the melee cut him to pieces.  
 
His faithful horse jumped off the boat to swim back but was swept 
away by the currents and drowned.  
 
Gaozu went on to found China's longest dynasty, the Han, in 202 B.C. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
The warlord Cao Cao of Wei was pursuing the fleeing army and 
population of Shu, led by the ‘Heroes of the Peach Grove’ 15  - Liu Bei 
and Zhang Fei. The retreating column came upon the Changpan Bridge 
over the Wei River with the enemy army only hours behind. On the 
opposite side of the river, there was heavy forest. 
 
Zhang Fei turned to Liu Bei and said, "This bridge is the only crossing 
point for miles, and provides us with an advantage. You take the army 
and people across while I hold off the Wei army to give you as much of 
a lead as possible." 
 
After the Shu army had crossed over, Zhang Fei sent his small group of 
cavalrymen across the bridge into the forest where they tied branches to 
their horse's tails and rode around in circles. Zhang Fei remained sitting 
on his charger in the middle of the bridge.  
 
When the pursuing army of Wei came upon the sight of Zhang Fei 
alone on the bridge they stopped. Cao Cao noticed the huge dust cloud 
in the distance behind the woods and suspected a trap. Zhang Fei roared 
out a challenge to the Wei army but Cao Cao, now convinced this was a 
ruse, turned his men around to retreat.

similar oath is sworn by members of almost every secret brotherhood in China 
ever since.

Zhang Fei seeing the Wei army retreating spurred his charger towards 
the Wei as though to attack them single-handedly. This so unnerved the 
Wei forces that they made a mad scramble to escape the area convinced 
a trap was closing around them. This trick bought Liu Bei and Zhang 
Fei enough time to escape with their men and regroup at Jiangling. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
In A.D. 431 the Song emperor, Wendi, launched a campaign to win 
back the province of Henan that was under the control of the kingdom 
of Wei.  
 
The emperor sent his general, Tao Cu, to attack Wei. The Song army 
fought and won more than thirty engagements, penetrating deep into 
Wei territory. Now, every commander knows that when an army is 
deep inside enemy territory his supply lines are the most crucial and 
vulnerable.  
 
Wei took advantage of this weakness to secretly send a detachment of 
cavalry that succeeded in cutting off the Song supply lines. The Song 
army was without provisions and in desperate straits. Tao Cu was 
planning to retreat, but this would leave the army extremely vulnerable 
to a rout and slaughter. To make matters worse, many of his soldiers, 
afraid and starving, deserted to the Wei side and divulged to Tao Cu's 
the plan to retreat. 
 
The Wei readied their forces to pursue the Song the instant they broke 
camp. To avert the impending tragedy, Tao Cu devised a stratagem.  
 
During the night he ordered his troops to carry baskets of sand and pile 
them into great heaps within the compound. The Wei scouts, listening 
to the night-long commotion, were curious and crept closer to the Song 
positions in order to see by first light what was happening. Tao Cu then 
had the piles of sand covered by a thin layer of grain. 
 
The next morning the Wei scouts were shocked to see huge piles of 
grain that they assumed were smuggled in during the night. When the 
Wei commander heard this, he suspected that the deserters' reports 
were a ruse to lure him into a trap, and had them all executed.

The Wei canceled their planned attack. Two days later the Song army 
quietly escaped to their home territory. 
 
Hojo Regency Japan 
 
In 1331 the emperor Go Oaigo rebelled against the Hojo Shogunate 
which had ruled over a series of puppet emperors. The emperor fled 
Kyoto with the imperial regalia and took refuge in a mountain 
monastery. 16 The emperor's loyal commander, Kusunoki Masashige, 
in order to divert the impending attack away from the emperor, erected 
a wooden palisade on the side of the mountain. 
 
When the Hojo army arrived, they saw the poor construction of the 
defenses and rushed to attack the encampment. Kusunoki's troops, 
though numbering less than five hundred, had constructed several 
ingenious defenses such as pitfalls, trenches, and logs suspended along 
the steep slopes that they could unleash to roll down onto the advancing 
attackers. 
 
After several failed attacks, the Hojo troops resolved to blockade the 
fort and starve the defenders out. Kusunoki had only a few days' worth 
of supplies left, and he knew that his troops would soon be too weak to 
fight. So he devised a strategy in which he could escape without pursuit.  
 
A huge funeral pyre was prepared and covered with the bodies 
recovered from the battlefield. One volunteer remained behind to light 
the fire and wait for the Hojo troops.  
 
Under cover of darkness, Kusunoki and his troops quietly escaped 
through a hidden trench cut through the stockade. Once they were in 
the mountain forests, their familiarity with the terrain enabled them to 
disperse into the undergrowth. At the same time, the funeral pyre was 
set ablaze and it burned so brightly that it lit up the sky. 
 
Hojo sent scouts to find out the cause of the blaze. When they found the 
compound undefended, the Hojo troops rushed in only to find a huge 
funeral pyre with a solitary attendant kneeling before the fire.

imperial tripods of ancient China - emblematic of the right to rule.

When he was questioned, he told them that Kusunoki and his troops, 
knowing they would be defeated, committed suicide en mass. As the 
Hojo could see burning bodies among the embers they believed the 
story and did not search for any remaining troops. 
 
Kusunoki escaped that night and he continued to fight for the imperial 
house for another seven years. He became known as one of Japan's 
greatest heroes renowned for his unflinching loyalty to the emperor. 
 
Summary 
 
It is a well-known rule of war that troops are extremely vulnerable 
when retreating. A strong attack against retreating troops usually leads 
to a rout and slaughter. Whenever you are moving troops, leave behind 
something that will divert or slow potential pursuers.
