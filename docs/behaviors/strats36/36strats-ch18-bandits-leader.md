To Catch The Bandits First Capture Their Leader 
Deploy a detachment of shock troops and select commandos 
to focus their assault on the enemy's vital points. This is the 
way to slay their commanders. 
 
Sun Bin, Art of War 
 
If the enemy's army is strong but is allied to the commander only by 
money or threats then, take aim at the leader. If the commander falls, 
the rest of the army will disperse or come over to your side. If, however, 
they are allied to the leader through loyalty, then beware, the army can 
continue to fight on after his death out of vengeance. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 756 B.C. the rebel commander Yin Ziqi led an army to lay siege 
against the strategic city of Suiyang.

The defending commander, Zhang Xun, noticed that Yin Ziqi oversaw 
the siege from well outside the range of the city's archers. He believed 
that if he could take out the leader the rebel's morale would sink and he 
would be able to launch a counter attack. He devised a plan with his 
best archers. 
 
The next time the rebels assailed the wall they were to shoot back using 
the branches of trees. When Yin Ziqi heard that the defenders were 
reduced to shooting with branches he felt certain the city was ready to 
be taken.  
 
Before the next assault, he moved in closer to better oversee the final 
victory. Riding atop his horse he unknowingly came within range of the 
archers who had saved their arrows for just such a moment.  
 
One arrow hit Yin Ziqi in the left eye killing him instantly.  
 
The spectacle of their commander's death in front of almost the entire 
rebel army served to demoralize them to such an extent that they 
quickly dispersed from the field. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
In A.D. 369 there were numerous rebellions against the rule of Emperor 
Fu Jian of the former Qin dynasty. One rebel general, Li Yan, joined 
forces with the local hill tribes and proclaimed himself governor of the 
province of Yi.  
 
Fu Jian sent his ablest commander Wang Meng to quell the rebellion. 
Wang Meng promptly attacked and defeated Li Yan's outlying 
command posts scattering the tribes back into the hills. Then he chased 
Li Yan to the city of Fuhan where he laid siege to the city.  
 
Li Yan was terrified of being executed and sent his younger brother to 
seek terms of surrender from the emperor. Wang Meng called out for Li 
Yan to surrender, but Yan would not come out from behind the city 
walls.

Another commander urged Wang to attack the walls but Wang Meng, 
refused saying, "I received an imperial order to seize a rebel, not to 
fight a war."  
 
Instead of attacking the walls, Wang Meng employed a Trojan horse 
strategy. He dressed himself in multi-layered white robes, mounted a 
ceremonial carriage, and rode up the city gate accompanied by only 
two unarmed attendants. There he announced that he had come alone 
and unarmed to personally negotiate a peace treaty with Li Yan himself.  
 
Yan, seeing that Wang posed no threat, finally agreed to negotiate and 
he went to open the gate. Unseen from the city walls, were a handful of 
armed soldiers, some hidden under Wang's robes, others clinging to the 
underbelly of the carriage.  
 
As soon as Li Yan walked out the gate, these hidden soldiers rushed out 
and seized the rebel general so fast that his own troops were too 
dumbfounded to react. They hustled him off in the carriage and Wang 
Meng returned him to the capital. Without a leader, the province was 
brought under control without any further battles. 
 
Heian Period Japan 
 
There was an aristocrat known by the name of Master Yoga who had a 
dispute over the ownership of some rice paddies with another official 
named Sawamata. One night, Master Yoga was woken from his sleep 
to discover that Sawamata had launched a surprise attack. The attackers 
numbered over six hundred men, and Master Yoga, with less than a 
hundred retainers, was certain his fate was sealed.  
 
Sawamata's troops surrounded the compound and set it ablaze with fire 
arrows. Those who tried to escape the fire were shot down by the 
archers. By morning all the defenders were dead. Sawamata ordered his 
troops to bring him the head of Master Yoga but the bodies were so 
charred they were unable to identify him, although they found his 
armor on one of the corpses. 
 
"In any case, no one escaped alive, not even a dog," said Sawamata. "I 
am certain that Master Yoga is dead as well."

Sawamata and his men left the charred ruins to return home. On the 
way back they stopped at the mansion of an elderly aristocrat to seek 
food and fodder as well as medicine for their wounded.  
 
Sawamata told his tale to the Great Prince who said, "I'm impressed 
that you were able to kill Yoga in so brilliant a fashion. He was 
extremely clever, a man of such ferocity and energy that I wouldn't 
have expected you could trap him in his house and kill him. Well, now I 
trust you have his head tied to your saddle and I would like to see it." 
 
"That's a ridiculous request. I told you all that was left were burned 
corpses. Surely, you wouldn't expect me to carry around such a 
disgusting thing as a charred head," replied Sawamata. 
 
"Yes, I understand. It is just that from an old man's experience I would 
feel much more at ease if I knew his head was tied to your saddle just in 
case it revived.  
 
But since it isn't, I cannot take the risk that Yoga is still alive and that I 
would be caught having to defend someone as unreasonable as you. 
Therefore you must leave immediately! However, I will send you all the 
provisions your men need." 
 
Sawamata deferred to the elderly prince and he and his troops 
continued along the road. A short time later several carts carrying the 
food and fodder arrived and they stopped to unsaddle their horses and 
heat the wine. After having fought through the night and then marching 
until late day, Sawamata's troops were near exhaustion. They eagerly 
drank down the wine and ate the food, after which they all fell asleep 
along the side of the road. 
 
Unbeknownst to Sawamata, Master Yoga was still alive. The night 
before he had decided fighting was futile, so he dressed a corpse in his 
armor and, with a handful of men, slipped through the latrine and swam 
out through a narrow canal to escape.  
 
While Sawamata was still at the Great Prince's mansion, Master Yoga 
had managed to round up some men from the countryside so that they 
now numbered fifty. A scout reported that Sawamata's troops were all 
asleep in the fields not far away.

Master Yoga turned to his men and said, "Now is the time to strike. 
Presently they believe me dead and are drowsy from food and drink. If 
we attack with our fifty men now we may still have a chance''  
 
Master Yoga and his men attacked and caught Sawamata's troops by 
complete surprise. Many fled in panic while others were slain reaching 
for their saddles and weapons.  
 
Sawamata was killed, and Master Yoga made sure to tie his head to his 
saddle. 
 
Summary 
 
To kill a poisonous snake you must cut off the head. For if you should 
you cut the snake in half, then the section containing the head may yet 
coil suddenly and bite. To destroy an opponent you must destroy the 
command structure to insure that the defeated do not merely find 
another leader.
