The Strategy Of Sowing Discord 
Reduce the effectiveness of your enemy by inflicting 
discord among them. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Plans and projects for harming the enemy are not 
confined to any one method. Sometimes entice his wise 
and virtuous men away so that he has no counselors. Or 
send treacherous people to his country to wreck his 
administration. Sometimes use cunning deceptions to 
alienate his ministers from the sovereign. Or send skilled 
craftsmen to encourage the people to exhaust their wealth. 
Or present him with licentious musicians and dancers to 
change his customs. Or give him beautiful women to 
bewilder him.

Undermine your enemy's ability to fight by secretly causing discord 
between him and his friends, allies, advisors, family, commanders, 
soldiers, and population. While he is preoccupied settling internal 
disputes, his ability to attack or defend is compromised.' 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
Towards the end of the Warring States period, as the smaller kingdoms 
fell prey to the larger, the kingdom of Qin had become the single most 
powerful state. Qin posed the greatest threat to the other surviving 
kingdoms, which sought to form an alliance to stem Qin's growing 
power. The various commanders of the empire gathered in the formerly 
powerful state of Zhou to plan an attack on Qin. 
 
King Chao Xiong of Qin was concerned about the gathering of 
warlords when his minister, Marquis Ying, said, "Allow me to get rid of 
them. Qin has no quarrel with these 'commanders of the empire.' They 
gather now to make plans for an attack against Qin simply because 
each seeks wealth and fame for himself.  
 
Look at your own hounds-some are sleeping, some are up, some walk 
about and others are simply standing where they are. But throw a bone 
to them and they will all be on their feet in an instant, snapping at each 
other. Why? You have given them a reason to fight each other." 
 
The king understood and asked the minister to continue.  
 
Minister Ying called in another official and said, "We must dispatch 
Tang Chu complete with musicians and five thousand in gold to set up 
quarters in Wu An. There he will send out a proclamation addressed to 
all military commanders saying that whoever wishes to defect to Qin 
will be given a sumptuous banquet and generous gifts of money. But 
those who conspire against Qin will receive nothing."  
 
Minister Ying turned to Tang Chu and said, "In order to succeed you 
must not care where the money goes, but insure that you distribute all 
of it. Once the money is gone we will send another five thousand 
Taels!"

A few days after Tang Chu left with the gold, he sent a report saying 
that he was able to distribute only three thousand pieces of gold before 
all the commanders of the empire took to fighting amongst themselves 
to see who would claim the greater reward.  
 
Needless to say they were unable to cooperate and no alliance against 
Qin was formed. For the next thirty years Qin continue to sow discord 
between the remaining states. Their constant bickering and infighting 
prevented them from ever uniting against their common enemy. Qin 
conquered them one by one until none remained. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
Cao Cao, the warlord of Wei, was on campaign against a rival 
commander Zhou Yu. Cao Cao won several battles and chased his 
enemy south into an area of rivers, lakes, and marshes. Coming from 
the northern plains of Wei, Cao's troops were unaccustomed to naval 
combat and suffered their first defeat at the hands of Zhou. Cao Cao 
made camp beside the river and began constructing an armada while 
retraining his troops in naval tactics. 
 
To this end, he hired the services of two renowned naval commanders 
who came from the south. During this time, one of Cao Cao's advisors, 
Jiang Kan, offered another plan.  
 
Since Jiang was a former friend of Zhou Yu, he would go to try and 
talk him into surrendering and joining with Wei. Cao Cao agreed to the 
plan and Jiang was given a small boat and an oarsman to paddle him up 
river to Zhou Yu's camp. Zhou Yu guessed right away Jiang's real 
purpose and played in turn the tactic of the "doomed spy." 24 Zhou Yu 
treated Jian like a long lost brother and arranged a celebration of food 
and wine. 
 
During the feasting, Zhou Yu slipped out and gave instructions to his 
attendants to forge two letters and place them on his desk. During the 
                                                      
24 According to Sun Zi’s Art of War, a “doomed spy” is a enemy spy whom 
you allow to watch staged events so that they will convincingly file a false 
report. After the ruse is discovered, the spy is usually executed for 
incompetence, hence the term “doomed”.

festivities, Jiang tried to persuade Zhou Yu to join forces with him, but 
Zhou Yu feigned drunkenness to avoid the subject.  
 
Later Zhou Yu invited his friend to share his quarters, and shortly after 
retiring he pretended to pass out. 
 
For a while, Jiang also pretended to sleep, but after making sure his 
host was asleep, Jiang silently crept about the room to see what he 
could find. He discovered the two letters and was intrigued to read 
about a plan to betray Cao Cao in the next battle. More shocking was 
that the letters were signed by Wei's new naval commanders. Jiang 
quickly hid the letters in his robe. 
 
Early the next morning he made his apologies and left before Zhou Yu 
awoke. When he arrived back at Cao Cao's camp, he reported that his 
mission had been a failure, but it was not a complete loss since he had 
some intelligence concerning a plot to stage a palace coup.  
 
He then produced the forged letters. After reading the documents Cao 
Cao had the two naval commanders executed.  
 
In this way, Zhou Yu removed Cao Cao's two best assets in naval 
warfare. When Cao Cao launched a naval attack months later he 
suffered a terrible defeat and barely escaped with his life (see Chapter 
34) 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
During the later Wei dynasty, the emperor Tai Wu led a hundred 
thousand troops against the Song general Zang Zhi. The emperor, with 
his superior forces, chased general Zhang to the city of Yu where he 
was cornered. The city was strongly fortified, and so the emperor 
planned to surround it and starve the defenders into surrender.  
 
Feeling confident of his position, the emperor sent a cart carrying a 
large jar of wine to the city gate with the message asking for the 
traditional exchange of wine before commencing his siege of the city. 
 
Zang Zhi, knowing that he needed to fight a decisive battle quickly or 
suffer defeat, saw this as an opportunity. He sent some soldiers to

gratefully accept the jar of wine and in turn deliver another large jar 
sealed with the wine maker's stamp.  
 
When a cup of this wine was poured for the emperor, it was discovered 
to be urine. This caused the emperor a humiliating loss of face before 
his own troops, and, in a rage, he ordered an immediate assault on the 
city. The defenders were well prepared and the bodies of the slain 
imperial troops piled up nearly to the top of the ramparts. In his haste 
and anger, the emperor lost half his forces. 
 
Summary 
 
A person's ability to function effectively is dependent on being in 
harmony with one's environment. By disrupting your enemy's 
environment, you disrupt his harmony, thus interfering with his ability 
to attack or defend.
