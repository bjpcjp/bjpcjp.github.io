Loot a Burning House  
Now, when your army is exhausted and your resources are 
spent, this is the time that new opponents enter the field to 
take advantage of your weakness. No matter how clever the 
leader is, once this situation has come about, the end is 
inevitable. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
When a country is beset by internal conflicts, when disease and famine 
ravage the population, when corruption and crime are rampant, then it 
will be unable to deal with an outside threat. This is the time to attack. 
 
Spring and Autumn Period China 
 
In the year 499 B.C. the king of Wu, Fu Chai, conquered the state of 
Yue and captured its king, Gou Jian. Rather than have him executed, 
the king of Wu made the deposed king of Yue work as a stable boy 
cleaning the imperial stables.

After three years, the king of Wu was feeling quite invincible and 
released Gou Jian to return to his country to serve as a vassal to the 
state of Wu. 
 
Once back in his home country, Gou Jian set about rebuilding his 
economy and reputation. Through his benevolent rule, the people 
prospered and upstanding counselors and commanders were drawn to 
his court to offer their services. After seven years of enlightened rule, 
Gou Jian knew that his citizens and his commanders would be willing 
to suffer even the hardships of war for his cause.  
 
To prepare for the impending attack on Wu, Gou Jian began with The 
Strategy of Sowing Discord (see Chapter 33). First, he bribed Wu's 
chief minister with eight beautiful women and a thousand pieces of 
gold. Next, he had false evidence planted against Wu's chief councilor 
who was thereby forced to commit suicide. 
 
Then fate provided Gou Jian with another strategy. That year Wu was 
experiencing a severe drought and the people were hungry. The king of 
Wu had spent copiously from his treasury in order to build a new 
palace and was reluctant to provide relief.  
 
Seizing the opportunity, Gou Jian sent a tribute consisting of a huge 
shipment of building materials with full honor guard in parade dress. 
This ostentatious display of wealth slowly wound its way through the 
hardest hit areas of the drought. The impoverished peasantry, seeing 
that the king was spending the treasury on lumber for his palace instead 
of rice for his starving subjects, began a revolt. 
 
The fatally arrogant king of Wu still balked at the earnest advice to 
send provisions to the drought ridden provinces, and sent out the army 
instead. This left the Wu capital poorly defended. As soon as his spies 
had reported on this, Guo Jian launched an attack on the capital of 
Wu. 
 
The king of Wu woke the next day to find his city surrounded and his 
army far away on campaign. Left with no able commanders and only 
the advice of the few ineffectual courtiers that survived his purges, the 
king fled into the countryside where he was dealt with later (see

Chapter 22). Thus, the king of Yue looted the burning house of Wu by 
setting the spark.  
 
Warring States Period China 
  
Qi and Han were allies when Zhang Yi attacked Han with the combined 
forces of Qin and Wei. Han asked Qi for assistance. 
 
The king of Qi said, "Han is our ally and since Qin has attacked her we 
must go to her rescue."  
 
But his minister Su Tianchen disagreed saying, "Your majesty's 
planning is faulty. You should merely agree to assist Han but take no 
action there.  
 
However, in the kingdom of Yan, their king has recently resigned the 
throne to his despised prime minister. This has enraged both the noble 
houses and the common people causing turmoil at court.  
 
Now, if Qin attacks Han, Chu and Zhao will surely come to her aid, 
and this will be as good as heaven bestowing Yan upon us." 
 
The king approved and promised the Han envoy assistance before 
sending him back to Han believing he had Qi's backing.  
 
When Qin attacked Han, Chu and Zhao intervened as expected. While 
all the major kingdoms were thus engaged in the battle for Han, Qi 
stealthily attacked Yan. Within thirty days, Yan was captured. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
It is written that King Hou Zhuwei of Northern Qi employed perverse 
sycophants to govern the realm and exercise control over planning. 
Each of these men in turn maintained their own personal factions, 
promoting their own cronies outside the normal order. 
 
The laws were relaxed, official matters advanced by wealth, lawsuits 
were concluded through bribes, and chaotic government harmed the 
people. Subsequently these actions brought about the specter of drought 
and flooding rains, while raiders and thieves both increased. Moreover,

the ruler was suspicious and jealous of other kings so that they suffered 
harm even though they were innocent. Several high officials fell under 
suspicion and were executed even though they had not committed any 
crime. 
 
Gradually the signs of corruption and decay were being manifest so that 
the end was in sight. Shortly thereafter, the emperor Wu of Northern 
Zhou took advantage of the situation to attack and exterminate the 
kingdom of Northern Qi. 5 
 
Summary 
 
The death of every civilization is brought on by three events: starvation, 
disease, and war. A culture suffering from any two becomes the target 
for the third. An ancient proverb states that when a tiger is sick or 
wounded, jackals gather nearby. 
 
 
                                                      
5 “Drought and Rain” is a reference to Chinas’ dike and canal system that was 
the expensive and ongoing responsibility of the central governments. If the 
government was lax in its maintenance, and allowed the system to fall into 
disrepair, then irrigated areas would suffer drought while silt on the river beds 
would build up until the river overflowed the dikes flooding the lowlands. The 
degree o which this system was maintained was considered an indicator of the 
stability of the government.
