Observe the Fire on the Opposite Shore  
To remain disciplined and calm while waiting for disorder to 
appear amongst the enemy is the art of self-possession. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Delay entering the field of battle until all the other players have become 
exhausted fighting amongst themselves. Then go in full strength and 
pick up the pieces. 
 
Chinese Folktale 
 
One day a clam exposed on the river bank opened its shell to take in the 
sun. A snipe came over to peck at the exposed flesh of the clam, which 
quickly closed its shell to clamp the bird's beak. 
 
"If no rain comes in the next two days, there will be a dead clam," said 
the snipe.

"If you don't get your beak free in the next two days, there will be a 
dead snipe," replied the clam. 
 
Then along came a fisherman who easily caught them both.  
 
Warring States Period China 
 
Wei was at war with Han who called upon Qi for help. The marquis of 
Qi summoned his ministers and asked them, "Would it be better for us 
to go to Han's relief immediately or should we wait?" 
 
Some advised an immediate expedition before Han was conquered but 
one advisor disagreed. "Have you not heard that when two tigers fight 
one will be killed and the other crippled?  
 
Neither the troops of Han nor Wei are yet exhausted and were we to go 
to Han's rescue we would simply be a substitute victim for Wei's armies 
and our forces would soon be taking orders from Han.  
 
At present Wei is intent on having Han, and when Han is about to 
perish she will surely send another plea for help. We should therefore 
make a secret treaty with Han offering our support but delay sending 
any aid until Wei is seriously weakened." 
 
The marquis agreed and gave the envoys secret assurances that he 
would join their side and sent them back to Han. Believing that Qi was 
wholly behind them, Han fought five battles and lost each one. Only 
when Han was about to fall did Qi send in her troops who crushed the 
weakened Wei forces at Maling.  
 
With Wei and Han now both near collapse the marquis of Qi forced 
both to submit to his sovereignty and become vassals of Qi. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
In the early years of the Three Kingdoms Period the warlord Cao Cao 
had defeated and killed his rival Yuan Shao in the battle of Guandu.

After his death, Yuan's three sons began fighting over the succession. 
Cao Cao decided to launch another attack, but as soon as he began to 
mobilize his troops the sons united their forces against him. 
  
Then one of his ministers, Guo Jian, said, "When we attacked we 
provided the three sons a common enemy to unite them. Let us bide our 
time and allow them to resume fighting amongst themselves. After they 
have weakened themselves we can attack again." 
 
Cao Cao withdrew his army and soon the Yuan brothers renewed their 
squabbling. The elder brother was angry because his father had named 
his middle brother as successor. The youngest brother supported the 
middle brother. Eventually the two younger brothers won out and the 
eldest brother was killed.  
 
During this time Cao Cao had started attacking outlying provinces. By 
the time the eldest brother was killed, the two remaining brothers 
feared engaging Cao Cao and instead fled to a distant province in the 
northeast to seek the aid of a nomadic chief named Gongsun Gang. 
 
Some ministers urged Cao Cao to pursue the brothers before they could 
elicit the help of the barbarians, but Cao Cao ordered his troops to 
withdraw and assured his minister that Gongsun would soon send him 
the heads of the two brothers.  
 
Shortly thereafter a courier brought the two heads neatly wrapped and 
boxed. When asked by the confounded ministers for an explanation 
Cao Cao told them, "If I had attacked the brothers, Gongsun would 
assume that he would be next to fall under my dominion and his logical 
choice would be to unite with the brothers against me.  
 
But if I provided no threat to Gongsun then the success of the two 
brothers would be his next immediate threat. Since I did not present the 
threat, Gongsun was able to eliminate his next possible threat then and 
there." 
 
Hojo Regency Japan 
 
In 1583 the great general Toyotomi Hideyoshi was positioning his 
forces against Akechi Mitsuhide in what would be the battle of

Yamazaki. Shortly after the battle had engaged, Tsetsui Junkeian, an 
ally of Mitsuhide, arrived on the scene. Impressed by the superior 
forces of Hideyoshi, he refused to attack but instead ordered his men to 
line up in battle formation on a hill above the Horagatoge pass where 
he could watch the battle before deciding which general to side with. 
 
Seeing Hideyoshi gaining the advantage he betrayed his ally and sent 
his troops over to Hideyoshi's side.  
 
This incident was never forgotten and henceforth the Japanese 
equivalent of Observe the Fire on the Opposite Shore is known as "to 
wait at Horagatoge." 
 
Summary 
 
When there are several players each competing with the other to attain 
the same goal, restrain yourself from being drawn into the fray. While 
it may seem opportunity is slipping past, wait and watch. Either the 
goal will reveal itself as not worth fighting for, or you can attain it later 
with far less effort.
