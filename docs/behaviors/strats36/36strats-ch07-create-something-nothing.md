Create Something from Nothing 
Turning back is how the Way moves; weakness is the means 
the Way employs. The myriad things in the world are born 
from Something, and Something from Nothing. 
 
Lao Zi, Tao Te Ching 
 
Use the same feint twice. Having reacted to the first and often the 
second feint as well, the enemy will be hesitant to react to a third feint. 
Therefore, the third feint is the actual attack catching your enemy with 
his guard down. 
 
Six Dynasties Period China 
 
General He Ruodun of the Northern Zhou led his troops across the 
Yangtze to attack the state of Chen. General Hou Qi of Chen was sent 
forth to stop the Zhou invasion. Both armies set up fortified camps 
along opposite sides of the river.

Shortly after arriving on the scene, heavy rains caused flooding which 
cut off the supply lines of the invading Zhou army. Their troops were 
forced to scavenge for supplies while the Chen troops had supplies 
ferried along the river in small river craft. 
 
General He knew that without supplies his army would be forced to 
retreat, so he sought to likewise cut the Chen supply lines.  
 
First he had several boats built to resemble the local style and late at 
night ferried them to the Chen encampment. Inside the boats were 
hidden heavily armed shock troops. When the Chen troops waded out 
to receive what they believed to be their supply boats, they were taken 
by surprise. The shock troops inflicted heavy casualties and captured 
several Chen soldiers to be brought back for interrogation. From these 
captured troops General He learned that several of his own troops had 
deserted by riding down river until they were picked up by the Chen 
patrol boats. 
 
To prevent further desertions, General He had some horses brought 
onto his boats and then whipped. After this was repeated several times 
the horses became deathly afraid of boats and would rear and kick 
whenever one came close.  
 
He then sent a light division down river to set up an ambush. Several 
soldiers were given the boat-shy horses and told to ride along the river 
and pretend to defect to the Chen side. When the Chen river patrol saw 
the potential deserters, they brought the boats to the shore to pick up 
the new recruits. But when the horses were being loaded on board, they 
reared and kicked. Distracted by the commotion, the Chen troops were 
surprised and killed by the Zhou troops waiting in ambush.  
 
Thereafter, anytime a boat came down river, the Chen forces would 
chase it away, fearing another ambush. And anytime they saw troops 
willing to desert, they would refuse, fearing another trap. 
 
Sui Dynasty China 
 
In 587 the first Sui emperor, Wendi, launched an attack on the state of 
Chen. He sent one of his generals, He Nuobi, to encamp on the north 
side of the Yangtze River (which marked the boundary between the two

kingdoms) opposite the enemy's capital. Now every general knows that 
to be attacked while crossing a river is disastrous, so both camps waited 
for the other to make the first move. 
  
Each day He Nuobi ordered his troops to practice manoeuvres and 
create a great deal of noise as though preparing for battle, but he did not 
cross the river.  
 
The first time this happened, the Chen commanders were certain that 
the invasion had begun and they ordered their men to form defensive 
positions. But by sunset still no attack had come. Day after day this 
continued until finally the Chen general said, “That old fool is only 
playing games with us. We will pay no further attention to his antics." 
 
Meanwhile, General He Nuobi secretly bought or confiscated as many 
river boats as he could get hold of and had them hidden. Then he found 
a few dozen old hulks and used them to patrol the river. When the Chen 
patrols saw these wrecks they believed that the Sui army had, in any 
event, no usable boats with which to cross. By this time the Chen 
patrols ceased being on the alert.  
 
Having lowered the enemy's guard, General He Nuobi readied his 
hidden armada and prepared his men for battle. 
 
As a final precaution just before he launched his attack, he sent a group 
of soldiers disguised as hunters across the river to create a commotion 
by riding through the underbrush. The Chen troops were distracted by 
the sounds of the hunting party and failed to notice the Sui army 
crossing the river. 
 
The Chen forces were taken by surprise and all were put to the sword 
but one, who was allowed to escape to bring the news back to the 
capital. When the lone survivor gave his report, the king of Chen 
ordered his remaining troops to immediately set out for the border. 
 
He Nuobi had anticipated this move and had prepared an ambush that 
succeeded in wiping out the remaining Chen forces. When the Sui army 
arrived at the Chen capital, the king had no troops left with which to 
defend the city. The king was taken prisoner, and the state of Chen 
became a province of the Sui Empire.

Tang Dynasty China 
 
During the An Lushan rebellion in A.D. 756 the Tang general Zhang 
Xun was under siege by the forces of General Linghu Chao.  
 
Outnumbered twenty to one, the defending Tang forces soon ran out of 
arrows. To remedy this General Zhang ordered his men to make straw 
dummies and dress them in black uniforms. 
 
That night the dummies were lowered over the city walls by ropes, 
accompanied by the beat of war drums and gongs. General Linghu 
thought the enemy was launching a surprise night offensive and 
ordered his archers to shower the figures descending the walls with 
arrows. Once the dummies where riddled with arrows the Tang soldiers 
pulled them back up over the walls, thus restoring their supply of 
arrows. 
 
The next day General Linghu, feeling humiliated, attacked the walls in 
revenge. That night the Tang again lowered the dummies but General 
Linghu ordered his men to ignore them believing it was the same trick 
to get more arrows.  
 
When General Zhang saw that no one was firing at the straw dummies, 
he ordered five hundred of his best troops to be lowered instead. They 
made a lightning raid on the encamped soldiers, catching them 
completely by surprise. The siege was lifted and General Linghu's army 
fled the field. 
 
Summary 
  
Sun Zi wrote that the direct attack and the indirect attack are 
interchangeable depending on the enemy's expectation. Here a feint 
(Nothing) becomes the direct attack (Something) which, due to the 
enemy's assumptions, is in fact an indirect attack. This is what is meant 
by being interchangeable.
