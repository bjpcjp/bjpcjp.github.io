Clamor in the East, Attack in the West 
The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known, 
for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible 
attack at different points and his forces will then be spread 
out too thin. For, if the enemy should strengthen his van, he 
will weaken his rear. Should he strengthen his rear, he will 
weaken his van. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
In any battle, the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming 
advantage. Even when face-to-face with an enemy, surprise can still be 
employed by attacking where he least expects it. To do this you must 
create an expectation in the enemy's mind through the use of a feint.

If you plan to attack on the right flank, you first maneuver your left, if 
you wish to invade, you first pretend to improve your defense, if you 
intend to hold your ground, make a display of packing up. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
In A.D. 200 rival warlords, Yuan Shao and the infamous Cao Cao met 
at what would be the battle of Guandu. The numerically superior forces 
of Yuan Shao sent a division to attack the small city of Baima situated 
to the rear of Cao Cao's army. Yuan Shao hoped this maneuver would 
cut off his enemy's communications, supply lines, and avenue of escape, 
thus ending their long rivalry. 
 
When reports came in that Baima was under siege, Cao Cao called 
together his advisors to plan a way out of their precarious situation.  
 
They could not go directly to Baima since they would be vastly 
outnumbered, yet they could not allow Yuan Shao to occupy such a 
strategic position. 
 
Then one advisor suggested a feint against Yuan Shao's old stronghold 
at the city of Ye. Cao Cao agreed to this plan and personally led the 
army towards Ye.  
 
When Yuan Shao heard that Cao Cao had crossed the river and was 
heading towards Ye, he and half of his forces went with the intention of 
trapping Cao Cao between the Ye garrison in the front and his 
reinforcements from the rear. 
 
Meanwhile, Cao Cao had reversed directions in the middle of the night 
and, through a forced march, arrived at Baima before dawn. There 
Yuan Shao's remaining troops were completely taken by surprise and 
annihilated using the very strategy Yuan Shao hoped to use at Ye.  
 
When Yuan Shao reached Ye, he found no one had seen nor heard of 
any invading army. Realizing he had been tricked, Yuan Shao turned 
his army around to return to Baima. On the way back, Yuan Shao 
learned that his general had been killed and the siege lifted. Realizing 
he had lost the engagement, Yuan Shao returned to his old stronghold

of Ye to recoup his losses. However, in the end he would lose all to 
China's most notoriously cunning strategist, Cao Cao. 
 
Song Dynasty China 
 
Once there was an official who was transferred to the capital.  
 
The front part of the inn where he stayed was a teahouse, and across the 
street was a shop that sold expensive dyed silks. Whenever he had 
nothing to do, he would sit at a table watching the people and activity 
on the street.  
 
One day he noticed with surprise that several suspicious looking 
characters were walking back and forth observing the silk shop with 
great interest. 
  
One of them came up to his table and whispered, "We're in the robbery 
business and we're here to steal those fine silks. Since you noticed us, I 
came to ask you not to mention it." 
 
"That has nothing to do with me," the official replied. "Why should I 
say anything about it?"  
 
The fellow thanked him and left.  
 
The official thought to himself, "The silk shop has its wares openly 
displayed on a busy street. In broad daylight, with a thousand eyes 
watching, if they have the skill to steal those silks, then they must be 
smart thieves indeed." So he watched carefully to see how they would 
manage it. 
 
But what he saw was only the same people walking back and forth in 
front of the silk shop. Sometimes they gathered on the left, sometimes 
on the right. The official sat watching until after sunset when everyone 
had gone and the shop had closed. 
 
"Those fools," said the official to himself, "They were putting one over 
on me."

When he returned to his room to order some food, he discovered that 
all his belongings were gone. 
 
Yuan Dynasty China 
 
In 1220, Genghis Khan and his general, Subede, were planning the 
conquest of the Muslim Empire of Shah Alaed-Din Mohammed.  
 
After crossing the Pamir Mountains, Genghis entered the eastern edges 
of the Shah's empire in the Fergana Valley where he split his army into 
three divisions. Two divisions continued west to attack Kokan. When 
the Shah heard that two Mongol columns were marching towards 
Kokan, he rushed all remaining reserves to secure this area. 
 
Meanwhile Genghis' own column quietly turned north and, in a 
legendary feat of endurance, crossed 300 miles through the reputedly 
impassable Kyzyl Kum Desert. Three months later, they emerged at 
Bokhara, deep in the heart of the empire and well behind enemy lines.  
 
With no one to oppose them, Genghis' troops were able to cut the 
Shah's communications preventing him from calling in reserves and 
supplies from the western provinces. All three armies then converged 
on Samarkand. 
 
Mohammed, cut off from his reinforcements, realized the situation was 
hopeless and escaped to the south with his remaining troops. He lived 
as a fugitive being hunted by the Mongol forces from town to town 
until he died one year later. 
 
Summary 
 
Where the enemy expects you to attack, he will reinforce. When he 
does so, a part of his army is thus neutralized, defending nothing. Then, 
with your full strength, attack his remaining forces.
