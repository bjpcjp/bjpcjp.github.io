Shut the Door to Catch the Thief 
When one fights an opponent and it appears on the surface 
that he has been defeated, if his fighting spirit has not yet 
been eradicated in his heart of hearts, he will not 
acknowledge defeat.  
 
In that case, you must quickly change your mental attitude 
and break the opponent's fighting spirit.  
 
You must make him acknowledge defeat from the bottom of 
his heart. It is essential to make sure of that. 
 
Miyamoto Musashi. The Book of Five Rings 
 
If you have the chance to completely capture the enemy, then you 
should do so, thereby bringing the battle or war to a quick and lasting 
conclusion. To allow your enemy to escape plants the seeds for future 
conflict. But if they succeed in escaping, be wary of giving chase.

Warring States Period China 
 
In 449 B.C. the state of Wu had invaded the state of Yue and carried off 
its duke, Guo Jian, holding him prisoner for three years before 
releasing him back to his kingdom.  
 
When he returned, Guo Jian planned his revenge. For seven years, he 
ruled with benevolence and generosity, making a reputation as a wise 
and virtuous ruler until he felt his loyal subjects were prepared to 
undergo any hardship for him. He accordingly assembled his forces and 
attacked Wu, gaining a decisive victory (see Chapter 5). 
 
The king of Wu had to flee, but it would only be a matter of time before 
he was caught. He sent ambassadors to Guo Jian begging for mercy. 
They reminded him of how the state of Wu had released him to return 
to his own state. The king of Wu now asked to be granted the same 
favor. 
 
Guo Jian was contemplating granting this appeal when his prime 
minister Fan Li intervened and said, "When heaven gave the duke of 
Wu the grand opportunity for gaining power, he did not take advantage 
of it, and so he is a fugitive today.  
 
Should you fail to accept what fortune has now given you, you may be 
driven from your state, and then all the years of hardships you have 
borne will have been endured in vain." 
 
The duke was swayed by the argument and sent the ambassador back 
with the message that he would not grant any mercy.  
 
When the king of Wu received the message, he gave up all hope and 
committed suicide. 
 
Tang Dynasty China 
 
One of China's most notorious female rulers was the Empress Wu. 
After dethroning her son, Emperor Zhongzong, she took over the 
empire and ruled for twenty-two years.

During one of the innumerable court intrigues that took place during 
her reign, she suspected two high and corrupt officials of plotting to 
usurp her power. 
 
Using the strategy ‘It Takes a Thief to Catch a Thief’, she ordered one 
of those officials, Lai Junchen, to interrogate the other, Zhou Xing.  
 
Seeing an opportunity to escape suspicion while eliminating a rival, Lai 
invited Zhou for dinner and wine to discuss criminal cases. While 
pouring wine for his guest Lai asked, "Now with some prisoners they 
simply refuse to confess to their crime. Do you have any suggestions on 
how they might be made to cooperate?" 
  
“That's very easy," answered Zhou. "You simply take a large metal vat, 
fill it with water, and place it over a fire until the water is near boiling. 
Then order the prisoners to get into the vat. They will confess anything 
and everything." 
 
"Excellent," said Lai, who then ordered a large vat to be brought in and 
heated the way Zhou had advised. When the water was near boiling Lai 
stood up from his table and said, "I have received an imperial order to 
interrogate you on your involvement in a treasonous plot. Now would 
you please step into the vat." 
 
Zhou was terrified and immediately dropped to his knees to kowtow. 
He confessed his involvement, and implicated his co-conspirators. All 
were executed. 
 
Muromachi Period Japan 
 
In 1554 Mori Montanari sought to avenge the death of his lord, Suye 
Harukata, who had been overthrown in a palace coup and forced to 
commit suicide by another retainer. Mori was greatly outnumbered and 
so decided a stratagem was needed.  
 
He constructed a castle on the small island of Miyajima, situated in the 
inland sea near Hiroshima Bay. After the castle was completed, he 
spread the story that he was regretting his decision since he now 
realized how susceptible he was to attack by the Suye forces.

When the story reached Suye Harukata he thought it an excellent 
suggestion and promptly set off to take the castle. The castle turned out 
to be poorly defended and Suye took the island without bloodshed. He 
stationed five hundred troops in the castle and the rest of his thirty 
thousand troops were bivouacked on the island. 
 
Meanwhile Mori Montanari captured the town of Kuatsu, directly 
across the straight from the island. Harukata's troops were 
overconfident from their easy capture of the island and they failed to 
even post guards. Mori counted on the element of surprise and chose a 
moonless night to launch his attack. He hired local pirates to ferry his 
troops over and made them agree to immediately return so that neither 
army had the opportunity to escape. 
 
Mori divided his flotilla into two columns: one went to the north of the 
island to attack the Suye from the rear, while the second column 
crossed further to the south and then hugged the island's coastline to 
attack from the front. That night there happened to be a blinding 
rainstorm which further helped conceal the flotilla's approach. Both 
divisions attacked at dawn and, as expected, caught the Suye army by 
surprise. 
 
Finding that there were no boats in which to escape (it is presumed that 
the Mori troops scuttled or burned the ships that carried the Suye troops 
over), the Suye troops committed suicide by the hundreds. Mori had 
succeeded in luring his enemy into a position from which there was no 
escape, and in a single decisive battle completely wiped out his 
opponent. 
 
Summary 
 
While it is dangerous to corner your opponent into fighting to the death, 
it is equally dangerous to allow that opponent to escape with a hope of 
revenge. When you have your enemy cornered, leave a door open until 
his thoughts turn to escape and freedom, then close the trap and destroy 
him.
