 Let us proceed with caution, concentrating our strength, and 
add to it daily by winning over to our side those barons who 
are vassals of the enemy. Then, when the enemy stands alone, 
like a tree shorn of its leaves and branches, we will attack 
and destroy the root.

It is known that nations that border each other become enemies while 
nations separated by distance and obstacles make better allies. When 
you are the strongest in one field, your greatest threat is from the 
second strongest in your field, not the strongest from another field. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 628 B.C. the states of Jin and Qin joined forces to attack the state of 
Zheng. They laid siege to the capital, trapping the king in the city. 
Vastly outnumbered, the king of Zheng could not hope to win militarily.

His prime minister said, "The state is in imminent peril. If you summon 
your old advisor, Chu Zhiwu, and send him to Qin I'm sure he can 
convince them to depart." 
 
The king agreed and summoned the old advisor to explain his mission. 
That night Chu was lowered from the walls on a rope and he secretly 
made his way into the Qin camp.  
 
Meeting with the earl of Qin he said, "With Jin and Qin both besieging 
its capital, Zheng knows that it must perish. If the ruin of Zheng were to 
be of benefit to you I would not dare to speak to you. But you know 
what difficulties could arise in trying to maintain such a distant border 
from your capital. It would be constantly threatened by other states. Of 
what advantage is it to you to destroy Zheng to benefit your neighbor?  
 
His advantage will be your disadvantage. And moreover, previously 
you helped the duke of Jin to attain his position and he promised you 
two cities as a reward. But as soon as he was in his own state again he 
built defenses around the two cities.  
 
Surely you can see that he is greedy. If you help him to annex Zheng to 
his domains, who will be next to lose territory to his insatiable hunger?  
 
Furthermore, if you agree to depart, the king of Zheng will give you 
provisions for your army and gifts for yourself. Surely this is no injury.  
 
But I leave it up to you to decide whether to diminish Zheng in order to 
advantage Jin. 
 
The next morning the Qin army left the field. When the duke of Jin saw 
them returning he also withdrew and Zheng was spared. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
The king of Wei was attacking the capital of Zhao and demanded 
troops from Song. The ruler of Song secretly sent an envoy to the king 
of Zhao to say, "The forces of Wei are vigorous and their power is 
great. Presently they are demanding troops from Song to use against 
you.

My lord is afraid that if he does not comply it will mean the end of his 
country. But if Wei should attack Zhao and truly harm her, my lord 
could not bear it." 
 
The king of Zhao replied, "What can I do to help you?" 
 
"I shall request from you a border town which we will attack slowly. 
We will spend many days trying to take the town until the time is right 
for you to send down your officers and reclaim the place again." 
  
"Excellent!" said the king of Zhao.  
 
The Song forces marched out and laid siege to the border town. The 
king of Wei was happy and said, "The Song forces are aiding my 
attack." The king of Zhao was also happy and said, 'The Song forces 
will not go any further."  
 
A few months later Song's troops were retired, the crisis avoided, Wei 
was grateful, and Zhao suspected nothing. 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
In A.D.110, the province of Henan had suffered through droughts and 
floods, the harvests were poor and the people starving. The corrupt 
government only made matters worse, and soon the whole province 
was in chaos. Any hope of bringing in outside relief was thwarted by 
the numerous bands of bandits and robbers that roamed the countryside 
pillaging and terrorizing the population. 
 
A provincial official by the name of Yu Hu was appointed full powers 
to try to restore some order to the province. When he arrived at the 
district capital, he issued a notice that he was going to organize a 
military force and that he was looking for recruits. 
 
First, he promised a pardon for past crimes and immunity for anyone 
who joined up. Then he announced that he was looking for men for 
three classes of troops. The first class of troops were to consist of men 
who had committed robbery and murder. They would be the 
commanders and receive the highest salaries.

The second class would consist of men who had committed mere 
thievery. They would receive the next highest salaries. 
 
The third class would consist of men who had joined the robber bands 
simply because they were lazy and wished to avoid real labor. They 
would be paid the lowest salaries. 
 
Within a couple of weeks, Yu Hu had over three hundred new recruits.  
 
When they had been issued uniforms and weapons he had them paraded 
before him and said to them, "Your past deeds are now forgiven and 
you are free from prosecution. But you must still atone for the crimes 
you have committed against society. To do this you must now go out 
and hunt down all your past colleagues who have not answered my 
call."  
 
This they did and within a year the fraternity of bandits was extinct and 
the countryside made safe. 
 
Summary 
 
It is well known that a friend of your enemy becomes your enemy 
while an enemy of your enemy becomes your friend. Every powerful 
person, organization, or state will automatically create people, groups, 
and organizations that stand in opposition to it. To attack any objective, 
one can enlist the aid of those institutions that are the antithesis of your 
opponent's.
