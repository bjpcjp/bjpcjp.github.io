Bait them with the prospect of gain, bewilder and mystify 
them. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Prepare a trap, and then lure your enemy into the trap by using bait. In 
war, the bait is the illusion of an opportunity for gain. In life, the bait is 
the illusion of wealth, power, and sex. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
The earl of Zhi was preparing to attack Lesser Wei. To prepare for his 
attack he presented the king of Wei with four hundred mustangs and a 
beautiful white jade Bi. 12 The king was overjoyed and his ministers all

mystery.

offered their congratulations, but one minister, Nanwen Ci, looked 
distressed. 
 
The king seeing his demeanor asked, "The great state is very pleased 
with us! Why then do you look troubled?" 
 
The minister replied, "One must always examine thoroughly a reward 
given for no merit and deference shown where no force has been 
applied. Four hundred mustangs and a white jade Bi constitute the kind 
of gift a small state might give when serving a great one. But in this 
case the larger state makes the gift. Your majesty should ponder this." 
 
As a precaution, the king of Wei told his commander of the border 
guards what his minister had cautioned and ordered his troops to be on 
full alert.  
 
Shortly thereafter, as the minister intimated, the earl of Zhi arrived at 
the border with a large army. But when the earl saw the border guards 
posted at full strength, he retired saying, "Alas, there are worthy men in 
Wei, for they have anticipated my plans." 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
During the Han dynasty, General Li Mu was sent north to deal with the 
continuing problem of the Xiongnu. Every time General Li sought to 
fight a decisive battle with the nomads they would melt away into the 
endless expanse of the grasslands. 
 
Seeking to entice them into a position where they could be attacked, 
General Li devised the following strategy: He departed southwards 
with the main body as if returning home, but he ordered that his 
baggage train and accompanying heard of cattle lag behind.  
 
The Xiongnu, believing the general had given up, saw an opportunity to 
raid his trains and capture the prized herd. They followed behind the 
retreating army waiting for the right moment to seize the baggage train. 
 
Each day General Li allowed the baggage train to trail further behind 
until he came to a fork in the road that was surrounded by gently rising 
hills.

Judging this terrain to be ideal for his plans, General Li positioned his 
best troops in ambush behind the hills. He then gave orders for the 
baggage train to rest in the fork while the remainder of the army 
continued along the road.  
 
The Xiongnu, seeing the main body off in the distance while the 
baggage train was resting unprotected, rushed into the valley to attack.  
 
There they were ambushed from three sides, and over one hundred 
thousand nomad cavalrymen were killed. 
  
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
General Cao Cao of Wei used a similar tactic in his campaign against 
his rival General Yuan Shao.  
 
Hearing that Yuan Shao had crossed the Yellow River and captured a 
vassal city of Yanjing, Cao Cao led an army out against him. As he 
neared the enemy's territory Cao Cao had his column reverse positions 
so that the baggage train led while the army took up the rear. He 
ordered the army to lag further and further behind until the baggage 
train was over two hours ride ahead of the main army. The baggage 
train was thus the first to encounter the advancing army of Yuan Shao. 
 
The train handlers and guards, upon seeing the approaching army, 
abandoned the supplies and ran back down the road to warn Cao Cao of 
Yuan Shao's approach.  
 
Several advisors became anxious at this news but Cao Cao brushed off 
their concerns and even ordered his men to dismount, abandon their 
horses, and rest up on the side of a hill overlooking the main road. Soon 
after, Yuan Shao's army slowly came down the road encumbered by the 
plundered supplies from the baggage train.  
 
When the Yuan soldiers saw the abandoned horses they ran about 
wildly racing to round up as many horses as they could. With the Yuan 
forces in such total disarray, Cao Cao ordered his infantry to charge 
down the hill.

The Yuan were caught by surprise and could not form battle lines. They 
were completely routed and the scattered remnants of the army fled 
back over the border. 
Summary 
 
To know where and when your enemy plans to move is to have the 
advantage of foreknowledge. This can be accomplished by offering 
your enemy something he greatly desires, then you can control when 
and where he will be.
