The Strategy Of Combining Tactics 
Do not repeat tactics which gained you victory in the past, 
but let your tactics be molded by the infinite variety of 
circumstances. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Appearance and intention inevitably ensnare people when 
artfully used, even if people sense that there is an ulterior 
intention behind the overt appearance.  
 
When you set up ploys and opponents fall for them, then 
you win by letting them act on your ruse. As for those who 
do not fall for a ploy, when you see they won't fall into one 
trap, you have another set. Then even if opponents haven't 
fallen for your original ploy, in effect they actually have.

In important matters, one should use several strategies applied 
simultaneously. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme. In 
this manner if any one strategy fails you would still have several others 
to fall back on. Combining even weak strategies in unison has a greater 
effectiveness than applying them sequentially. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
The heir of Chu, Qing Xiong, was a hostage at the court of Qi when 
news came of his father's death. He asked permission from the king of 
Qi to return home to attend the funeral. 
 
The king replied, "If we are given five hundred li of your eastern lands 
you will be allowed to return. If you refuse you will stay here." 
 
Qing Xiong agreed to cede the land for his freedom and was allowed to 
return to Chu and become its new king. Shortly thereafter, an envoy of 
fifty chariots arrived from Qi demanding to take possession of the 
territory. The king of Chu summoned his top three generals one after 
the other and asked each in turn for their recommendations. 
 
The first general said, 'The king has no recourse but to give up the land. 
From a king must come only the truth .To have promised something 
and failed to give it would be a breach of faith. Thereafter no one will 
ever trust your promise.  
 
I submit that you give them the land to show your good faith, then 
attack Qi and fight to get it back, which would show your valor." 
 
The second general was asked for his opinion and he said, "You cannot 
give it back. What makes a country strong is the land. To give five 
hundred li is to lose almost half our country.  
 
I ask to be allowed to go out and defend the eastern border." 
 
Then the third general was called in and he said, "You cannot give them 
the land, yet we are not powerful enough to defend it alone. I beg 
permission to go west and seek aid from Qin."

After hearing the counsel of his three advisors, the king consulted his 
Minister Shen Ci asking which of the three strategies he should follow. 
 
Shen Ci said, "Use them all! Let each general carry out his own 
strategy unbeknownst to the others and we shall see which prevails." 
  
So the next day the king sent the first general to meet the envoy from 
Qi and surrender the territory. The day after that he commissioned the 
second general to defend the eastern border. On the third day, he sent 
the third general to Qin with a plea for aid. 
 
The first general rode out to the eastern territory to rendezvous with the 
envoy from Qi who had come to take possession of the territory. The 
next day they were intercepted by the second general who told the 
envoy from Qi that he had mustered troops to defend the territory. 
 
The envoy turned to the first general and asked, "You have come to 
surrender the territory, but now we have another general to defend it. 
How can this be?'' 
 
The first general replied, "I was personally instructed by the king in this 
matter. This man is usurping his authority and he should be attacked."  
 
The Qi envoy sent for reinforcements and when they arrived a few days 
later, they were led by the king himself. Just as they were about to form 
battle lines the third general arrived with a relief force from Qin. 
 
The Qin general called out to the king of Qi, "To have detained the heir 
of Chu was wicked, and to rob him of five hundred li of his eastern 
lands is unjust. If you wish to withdraw your troops, you may. If not, 
then you must contend with us as well." 
 
The king of Qi was frightened by this unexpected turn of events and 
quietly retreated. The king of Chu thus saved both his territory and his 
reputation. 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
In 284 B.C., the state of Yan attacked and defeated Qi. The remaining 
Qi forces under the command of Tian Dan fled to the city of Jimo for a

178 
final stand. The renowned Yan general Yue Yi had surrounded the city 
when the news came that the king of Yan had died and was succeeded 
by Prince Hui. 
 
Years earlier, when the prince was still heir apparent, he and general 
Yue had numerous clashes and disagreements. When Tian Dan heard 
the news he sent secret agents to the new king to spread rumors that 
Yue Yi was planning to revolt because he feared being executed for 
past disagreements. When Prince Hui heard this rumor, he sent another 
general to replace Yue Yi who fled to another state. 
 
The replacement general, Qi Che, was a brash and arrogant up-start 
who began reissuing orders and procedures which merely succeeded in 
causing confusion and dissension among the officers. 
 
Next, Tian Dan had the womenfolk line the city walls and beg for a 
peaceful surrender while he sent gold and treasure collected from the 
city's wealthiest citizens to General Qi Che with a note asking that the 
women and children be spared in return for the peaceful surrender of 
the city. 
 
These events convinced Qi Che that the city was truly about to 
capitulate, and he allowed his troops to relax their guard. After this 
careful preparation, Tian Dan felt the time was right to launch his 
counter attack. 
 
First, he had the citizens of the city gather with drums and cooking pots 
and instructed them that on a signal they were to make as much noise 
as possible.  
 
He then had breaches made along the city walls from the inside.  
 
Next, a herd of cattle was painted in bizarre patterns and knives and 
sickles tied to their horns and torches tied to their tails.  
 
Just before daylight three events occurred in rapid succession. The 
citizens within the city struck up a cacophony of noise that startled 
the sleeping Yan troops.

Then the torches on the tails of the cattle were lit and they were 
released through the breaches in the wall. 
 
The enraged animals ran madly about the Yen camp killing stunned 
troops with their horns and setting fire to tents with their tails.  
 
Then Qi’s crack troops rushed out from the gates to attack the now 
terrified and utterly confused troops. Tian Dan defeated the Yan army 
and went on to conquer more than seventy cities. 
 
Heian Period Japan 
 
In 1183 in what would be called the battle of Kurikara, Taira Koremori 
of the ruling Taira clan led a hundred thousand troops east to attack 
Minamoto Yoshinaka of the rebel Minamoto clan.  
 
To enter the Minamoto territory the Taira would have to cross Japan's 
central mountain range at its northern end where the mountains were 
little more than large hills. There was only one pass that an army the 
size of the Taira could use - the Kurikara pass. 
 
Traveling east through the pass one would see near the other side an 
open valley that appeared to cut through the mountain, but in fact the 
valley narrowed down into a box canyon. Seeking to take advantage of 
this unusual terrain, Yoshinaka devised the following strategies. 
 
First, he needed to buy time1 so he sent a detachment of troops to 
occupy a small hill downslope of the Taira advance. These troops 
carried extra flags, which they planted on the hill to make it appear that 
a large host was stationed there.  
 
The next day the Minamoto stationed on the hill challenged the Taira to 
battle according to all the ancient samurai protocols, to which the Taira 
readily complied. First, there was an archery duel using humming bulb 
arrows, then sharp point arrows, then individual duels, and finally a 
skirmish of a hundred cavalry each. 
 
While all this gentlemanly warfare was being fought, Yoshinaka had 
sent another detachment of troops through the forest to quietly set up

positions to the rear of the Taira. By nightfall the Taira were about to 
retire when two events occurred. 
 
First, the hidden Minamoto troops launched a sudden attack from the 
rear, while the troops on the hill charged down to join the first group.  
 
This sudden attack caused the Taira to retreat down the pass, but at this 
point, the second event occurred.  
 
Yoshinaka had earlier confiscated a herd of cattle and had torches tied 
to their horns. The torches were set on fire and the enraged animals 
were released so that they charged up through the pass towards the 
retreating Taira. 
 
The bizarre spectacle of the enraged and fiery beasts charging through 
the pass caused complete panic among the Taira troops who saw their 
only avenue of escape to be down the side of the pass and into the 
valley.  
 
In the darkness, the troops scrambled down the steep slopes and on 
through the valley, many being killed in falls. When the first of the 
fleeing soldiers reached the box end they attempted to turn back, but 
those in front were crushed by the weight of their own troops who kept 
piling in, not yet realizing they were trapped.  
 
Yoshinaka then launched his final tactic and sent his main body of 
troops into the valley after the fleeing Taira. The slaughter was 
horrendous, with over seventy thousand Taira soldiers killed. 
 
Summary 
  
To insure victory one must know how to launch simultaneous attacks. 
Both from left, and from right; from the outside, and from within; from 
above, and from below. Advantage goes to those who can attack on 
several fronts; disadvantage to those who must defend against more 
than one.
