In the spirit religion there is what is called the mystery of the 
spirits. The mystery is kept secret to foster religious faith. 
When people have faith, they and others benefit from it. In the 
Warriors Way, this is called strategy. Although the strategy is 
falsehood, when the falsehood is used in order to win without 
hurting people, the falsehood becomes true.

Take an institution, a technology, or a method that has been forgotten 
or discarded and appropriate it for your own purpose. Revive 
something from the past by giving it a new purpose or to reinterpret and 
bring to life old ideas, customs, and traditions. 
 
Qin Dynasty China 
 
In 212 B.C. the first emperor of China, Qin Shihuangdi, died while 
touring his empire. The emperor had always been afraid of death and

was constantly ingesting various "immortal elixirs" provided by a host 
of mystic frauds and pretenders. 10 To suggest that the emperor would 
one day die implied that he was a fool for taking these potions, which 
was tantamount to treason. No one dared mention the possibility of his 
mortality to him and as a result, he left no instructions as to who should 
succeed him. 
 
There were only two others present when he died: the chief minister Li 
Si, and the eunuch Zhao Gao. They plotted to keep his death a secret 
until they could decide for themselves whom to place on the throne.  
 
While the emperor's eldest son Fushu was the natural choice, both men 
dreaded his accession as it would mean their fall from power. To rid 
themselves of this potential threat they sent an order signed with the 
name of the emperor demanding that Fushu and his loyal general, Meng 
Tian, both commit suicide. 
 
The general suspected a plot and told the prince that he had three 
hundred thousand soldiers under his command and that they should 
march on the capital and demand an explanation from the emperor.  
 
But Fushu was so deathly afraid of his father, who was infamous for his 
harshness and cruelty, that he dared not question the imperial order lest 
some punishment even worse than death be visited upon him. Without 
further inquiry he committed suicide and his loyal general soon 
followed suit. 
 
Fushu's younger brother Huhei, who had been in on the plot to 
eliminate his brother, was installed on the throne under the control of Li 
Si and Zhao Gao. The young emperor was kept busy in the imperial 
harem while the two cronies took control of the government (see 
Chapter13).  
 
They were so corrupt and inept that shortly thereafter the entire empire 
was in open revolt. Within two years, all three had been executed and 
the House of Qin disappeared from history. 
 
                                                      
10  Many of these potions containes strychnine and mercury and some 
historians believe he may have slowly poisoned himself to death.

Han Dynasty China 
 
When the emperor Huidi died in 188 B.C. he left no heir. His mother, 
the empress Lu, bought a child several years before his death and had 
her daughter-in-law pretend that it was her own. To cover her tracks the 
empress had the boy's natural mother executed. After the emperor's 
death, the empress had this boy installed on the throne with herself as 
regent.  
 
However, within two years the boy, after learning that his true mother 
had been executed, was heard to say, "When I become emperor I will 
know what to do."  
 
When the empress's spies reported the words spoken by the young 
emperor she had him murdered and another puppet set in his place. 
 
The empress ruled a prosperous empire for eight years through the six 
successive child emperors that she installed on the throne before dying 
of a mysterious illness. Rumor said her death was the result of a curse 
from one of her late husband's concubines, who was horribly mutilated 
and tortured according to the empress's precise instructions. 11 
 
So horrible was the punishment meted out by the empress that her true 
son and heir, when shown the results of her handiwork, went insane, 
and died a year later. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
During the last stages of the crumbling Han dynasty the country was 
split apart by four warlord generals who had rebelled against the throne, 
each one seeking to found his own dynasty. The last Han emperor, 
Xiandi, was captured while on campaign against one of the four 
generals, but he managed to escape with a small entourage and make 
his way back to the war-torn capital of Luoyang.  
 
The confused and frightened emperor was planning to hide in a ruined 
palace until the trouble blew over, but was discovered by spies working

for another warlord named Cao Cao, who hurriedly marched his army 
to the desolate capital and captured the emperor. 
 
Cao Cao offered the emperor his "protection" which the emperor could 
hardly refuse. Thereafter the emperor was kept under close guard and 
used only to sign proclamations drawn up by Cao Cao who thereby 
claimed to be acting on behalf of the Han Dynasty's true emperor.  
For twenty years the emperor was used as a puppet behind which Cao 
Cao ruled until the emperor retired and handed over the seals of 
government. Cao Cao thereupon founded the short-lived Cao Wei 
dynasty.  
 
To prevent any future resurrection of the Han Dynasty, Cao Cao had 
the retired emperor and all remaining relatives assassinated, thus 
bringing an end to the great Han dynasty. 
 
Heian Period Japan 
 
In the 11th century, the warrior monks known as Yamabushi formed 
large monastic communities in the mountains surrounding the capital of 
Kyoto.  
 
Over time, their ranks increased and their power grew to the point that 
each monastery maintained a private army. From time to time, these 
monk armies would march into the capital to demand favors and 
concessions from the emperor, who by this time had become merely a 
figurehead. Although feared for their fighting prowess with a Naginata, 
(A halberd type weapon with a long curved blade at the end of a pole.) 
the monks also employed another tactic in the form of psychological 
warfare. 
 
They would carry into battle a huge portable shrine, known as a 
Mikoshi. Within the shrine it was believed there lived the spirit of one 
of the many gods the Yamabushi worshipped. Any offense against the 
Mikoshi was considered an offense against the deity itself. During 
battle, enemy archers dared not unleash their arrows into the 
Yamabushi ranks for fear of striking the Mikoshi and incurring the 
wrath of god.

At other times the monks would carry the Mikoshi into the town square, 
chant curses on the townsfolk and return to the mountains leaving the 
Mikoshi in the village.  
 
The townspeople were loath to go near it believing the town and 
everyone in it was cursed by its presence. Only after the townsfolk had 
gathered together a suitable "donation" would the monks return and 
haul the dreaded shrine away. 
Summary 
 
Symbols, myths, institutions, and philosophies have an inherent moral 
and emotional power. This power can be appropriated and used to serve 
the goals of a higher strategy.
