Trouble the Water to Catch the Fish 
Every day have the vanguard go forth and instigate 
skirmishes with them in order to psychologically wear them 
out.  
 
Have our older and weaker soldiers drag brushwood to stir 
up the dust, beat the drums and shout, and move back and 
forth- some going to the left, some going to the right, never 
getting any closer than a hundred paces from the enemy.  
 
Their general will certainly become fatigued, and their troops 
will become fearful. In this situation, the enemy will not dare 
to come forward.  
 
Then when we come forth with our three armies the enemy 
will certainly be defeated.

Before engaging your enemy's forces create confusion to weaken his 
perception and judgment. Do something unusual, strange, and 
unexpected as this will arouse the enemy's suspicion and disrupt his 
thinking. A distracted enemy is thus more vulnerable. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 632 B.C., the armies of Jin and Chu faced each other at Chengdu 
before the battle of the same name. Chu sent an envoy to Jin requesting 
to fight a chariot duel the next day to which the Jin ruler, Duke Wen, 
agreed.  
 
In the morning, Duke Wen climbed to the top of an observation tower 
and looking down on his camp's preparations said, "Young and old 
conduct themselves according to ritual. They are fit for use!"  
 
He then ordered his troops to cut down trees to be used as part of an 
unorthodox tactic. While the chariot duel was underway, Duke Wen 
launched a sudden cavalry attack against the Chu right wing causing it 
to collapse.  
 
At the same time as the right was being pushed into the main body, the 
Jin troops in the center raised the retreat pennants and began pulling 
back. As the Jin troops retreated, they dragged behind them the trees 
they had cut down earlier that morning. This raised such a dust cloud 
that the Chu commanders thought the Jin were fleeing in panic and 
eagerly gave chase.  
 
When the main body of the Chu army was enveloped in the cloud of 
dust they were unable to see that the Jin forces had split into two 
divisions and had turned around.  
 
The Jin attacked in a classical pincer movement on both of the Chu 
flanks. The result was a resounding defeat after which the Chu general 
was ordered to commit suicide.  
 
Duke Wen had taken advantage of the distraction provided by the 
chariot duel to launch both a surprise attack, and a retreat, manipulating 
the Chu forces into a trap.

Warring States Period China 
 
The three central states of Qi, Wei, and Han made an alliance to attack 
the northern state of Yan that in turn, sought help from the southern 
state of Chu. The king of Chu sent his general Xing Yang to rescue Yan.  
 
Unable to attack the combined forces concentrated in Yan, Xing Yang 
used the strategy ‘Besiege Wei to Rescue Zhao’, and captured the Wei 
city of Yongqiu. 
 
Wei and Qi were concerned that with the enemy holding a fortified 
position to their rear their lines of communication would be cut, so they 
set off to recapture the city.  
 
There were two roads that led to the city of Yongqiu and it was decided 
that the Wei forces would occupy the western road while the Qi, the 
eastern. This was to prevent Xing Yang from escaping. 
 
Xing Yang had succeeded in drawing the enemy away from Yan but he 
now had to extricate himself from a near hopeless situation. He resorted 
to an unorthodox strategy.  
 
Knowing the tenuous nature of any alliance during those ruthless times, 
Xing Yang ordered the west gate opened. By day he sent riders and 
carriages up the road towards the Wei camp but once they were out of 
sight in the woods they would wait for a while, then turn around and 
return. By night he had men run up and down the same road carrying 
torches. The Qi observers thought that the daytime activity looked 
suspiciously like envoys bearing gifts and tribute, while the nighttime 
activity looked like messengers bearing urgent communications. 
 
Believing that Wei had struck a deal with Xing Yang and that both 
were preparing a sneak attack on them, the Qi army withdrew during 
the night and returned home. The next day the Wei army learned that 
Qi had abandoned the field and they were left alone to retake the city.  
 
Thinking better of the idea, the Wei army also left the field, allowing 
Xing Yang to return to Chu after having successfully rescued Yan.

Five Dynasties Period China 
 
General Li Suyuan of Jin was sent to relieve the siege of Yuzhou and 
drive the invading Khitan tribes out of the empire.  
 
The Khitans set up defensive positions in advantageous terrain with the 
intention of using the strategy ‘Await the Exhausted Enemy at Your 
Ease’. Their plan was to attack the Jin troops before they had a chance 
to form battle lines. However, General Li's scouts reported that the 
Khitans were already waiting in formation, giving away their intentions.  
 
Li Suyuan ordered his infantry to hold back while the weak and weary 
soldiers went ahead dragging brushwood and burning fires as they 
neared the Khitan formations. This created such a cloud of dust and 
smoke that the Khitan commander could not see the Jin army and 
assumed the dust was being kicked up by a large infantry. Seeing an 
advantage, he ordered his men to break formation and attack what he 
believed would be an army of Jin troops blinded by the smoke and dust.  
 
But as the Khitans attacked, the Jin soldiers dropped their branches and 
ran off so that the Khitans advanced through the dust cloud surprised to 
discover no army there. As the disoriented Khitan army turned to 
escape from the clouds of dust, Li Suyuan ordered his army to charge 
in from the rear. The result was a rout and slaughter. The siege of 
Yuzhou was lifted. 
 
Summary 
 
Man and beast alike will spontaneously pay attention to anything 
unusual within their environment. Magicians, card sharks, pick pockets, 
and prize fighters rely on this trait to momentarily trap the person's 
attention elsewhere while they secretly carry out another action.
