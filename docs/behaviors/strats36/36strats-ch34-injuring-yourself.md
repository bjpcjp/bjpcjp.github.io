The Strategy Of Injuring Yourself 
To be the first to gain victory, initially display some weakness 
to the enemy and only afterward do battle. Then your effort 
will be half, but the achievement doubled. 
 
The Six Secret Teachings of the Tai Gong 
 
Pretending to be injured has two possible applications. In the first, the 
enemy is lulled into relaxing his guard since he no longer considers you 
to be an immediate threat. The second is a way of ingratiating yourself 
to your enemy by pretending the injury was caused by a mutual enemy. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
During the last days of the crumbling Han Empire the renowned 
general Sun Ce was on campaign against a rival province. He had 
chased the enemy to the walled city of Moling where they were holed 
up.

Sun knew it would be too costly to attack fortified positions, so he 
attempted to arouse the enemy's anger by parading up and down the 
city walls hurling insults at the defenders. But the commander of the 
city, Xue Li, refused to come out to fight despite the taunts. 
 
One day while Sun was out riding, a soldier on the city wall shot an 
arrow that hit Sun in the thigh, only slightly penetrating his armor. Sun 
rode back to camp where he was treated for a flesh wound. However, 
rumors were spreading that the general had been mortally wounded.  
 
The commanders thought he should go out of his tent to reassure the 
troops, but Sun used the situation to play a stratagem. 
 
He let it be known that he was mortally wounded and had his soldiers 
pretend to prepare for a funeral ceremony. Hearing that Sun Ce was 
dead, Xue Li saw this as his chance and rushed his army out to attack 
the camp.  
 
Sun Ce's troops pretended to retreat leading the attackers into an 
ambush that closed in from four directions with Sun charging out on his 
horse to the shouts of "Sun Ce lives!"  
 
The shocked city garrison threw down their arms and surrendered while 
Xue Li and a few loyal guards were slain trying to escape.

During the Tokugawa period, Kaei Juzo, a former spy, had come under 
suspicion and was in danger of being assassinated. It turned out that the 
man sent to kill him was a former acquaintance called Tonbe. Not 
wishing to kill his old friend, Tonbe and Juzo worked out the classic 
ploy as follows. 
 
Tonbe brought Juzo back as a prisoner to the Shogun. Juzo begged the 
Shogun to allow him one last dignity: permission to commit Seppuku.

The Shogun, curious to see the notorious spy's bravery in death, 
allowed him that privilege. Juzo was given a dagger, which he plunged 
into his belly, and, cutting sideways, he spilled his intestines onto the 
ground before falling over. The guards removed the body and threw it 
in the castle's moat. 
 
A short time later Juzo quietly swum to shore and escaped the district.  
 
Knowing that his warrior's reputation would merit him the right of 
committing seppuku, Juzo had strapped a dead fox across his abdomen, 
when the fox's intestines spilled out it was indistinguishable from 
human intestines. 
 
Three Kingdoms Period China 
 
Zhou Yu was the chief advisor for the state of Wu, which was at war 
with the powerful kingdom of Wei lead by the warlord Cao Cao.  
 
Cao Cao had sent two spies posing as defectors over to the Wu capital 
but Zhou Yu spotted them immediately. Rather than have the spies 
executed, Zhou Yu again used the tactic of the "doomed spy" (see 
Chapter 33). 
 
Zhou Yu sent for his senior and most trusted naval commander, Huang 
Gai, and together they devised a strategy. The next day at court Huang 
started an argument with Zhou Yu that escalated to the point where 
Zhou Yu ordered the naval commander's execution. Horrified at the 
prospect of losing one of their ablest commanders, the other court 
advisors intervened on Huang's behalf. 
 
Reluctantly, Zhou Yu commuted the sentence to fifty strokes of a staff 
to be carried out in the town square. This punishment was often fatal in 
itself, and the Wei spies who watched the beating were convinced that 
Huang Gai and Zhou Yu had truly fallen out. The next day, while still 
recovering from the ordeal, Huang secretly sent a message to the Wei 
camp offering to defect. 
 
At first, Cao Cao was suspicious, but when he called in his spies, they 
confirmed seeing Huang beaten to near death in the city square. Cao 
Cao was in desperate need for an able naval commander (having

recently executed his top two admirals on suspicions of treachery), so 
he gave the order to have Huang smuggled into his camp.  
After the usual formalities, Cao Cao asked for Huang Gai's advice on 
how to train his land based infantry in naval warfare.  
 
Huang Gai said, "Since the men of Wei are used to fighting on solid 
earth we should make the war junks as stable as the earth. Your 
lordship has a great number of boats, and if we had them strung 
together with chains, and the gaps between the boats covered over with 
planking, then it would be as stable as land."  
 
Cao Cao agreed to the plan, and after weeks of construction the huge 
floating platform proved so stable that the Wei soldiers felt like they 
were walking on solid ground. 
 
When Zhou Yu's spies reported Cao Cao's new naval strategy, he was 
ready to attack.  
 
The next day, some say by divine intervention, the winds changed 
direction enabling Zhou Yu to send fire ships down-wind against the 
floating island of Wei. When Cao Cao felt the change in wind direction 
and saw the burning ships bearing down, he knew all was lost. The 
minute one of his ships caught fire the whole fleet was doomed since, 
being chained together, no ship could escape.  
 
The entire Wei armada was completely destroyed and Cao Cao himself 
barely escaped with a handful of troops.  
 
Summary 
 
The tactic of feigning injury to lower your opponent's guard or avoid 
aggression is so universally applied that it is even found among many 
species of birds, fish, and animals. The principle is simple: if you are 
sick or injured, you are less of a threat.
