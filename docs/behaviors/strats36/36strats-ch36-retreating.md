If All Else Fails, Retreat 
 
If greatly outnumbered, then retreat. While it is possible for a 
small force to put up a great fight, in the end it will lose to 
superior numbers. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
If it becomes obvious that your current course of action will lead to 
defeat, then retreat and regroup. When your side is losing, there are 
only three choices remaining: surrender, compromise, or escape. 
Surrender is complete defeat, compromise is half defeat, but escape is 
not defeat. As long as you are not defeated, you still have a chance. 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 597 B.C., the states of Chu and Jin fought the battle of Bi. For days 
before the battle, the two armies faced each other, unsure whether or 
not a battle would actually take place. Several small skirmishes were

fought to release the energies of the officers, but it appeared that a 
peace treaty would be negotiated instead. 
 
On the Jin side, the commander of the left wing, Shi Hui, advised 
caution saying, "It would be well to take precautions. If Chu has no 
hostile intent, then we can do away with the precautions and conclude 
an alliance.  
 
But if Chu should come charging down on us, the precautions will 
prevent our defeat. Even when the Lords come together at a meeting, 
they take care not to dismiss their personal bodyguards." 
 
But the commander of the main body, Xian Gu, disagreed, and only Shi 
Hui took the precaution of stationing troops in ambush near his 
positions.  
 
The next day, during a small skirmish, the Chu forces misunderstood 
the commotion for an attack by Jin and launched a full-scale assault. 
The Chu charged forth with such speed and determination that the Jin 
lines collapsed from the impact. 
 
Another Chu division made ready to attack the Jin left wing 
commanded by Shi Hui. An officer rode up to Shi Hui and asked, 
"Should we wait for their attack?'' 
 
Shi Hui replied, "The Chu army is now at the peak of its vigor. If they 
make a concerted attack on us, our army is bound to be wiped out!  
 
Better to gather up our forces and quit the field. Though we will still 
share the disgrace with the other divisions, we at least spare the lives 
of our men. Is that not the best that could be had from this situation?" 
 
Shi Hui had the men stationed in ambush fight a rear guard action, 
enabling him to retreat with almost his entire division intact. The main 
Jin troops suffered a resounding defeat with heavy casualties.  
Commander Xian Gu, who had so thoughtlessly disregarded the advice 
to take precautions, was found guilty of incompetence and executed.

Warring States Period China 
 
When Wang Chu was hostage in Yan, the king wanted him executed, 
and so he fled. While trying to cross the border he was captured by a 
border guard.  
 
"The king of Yan wants me killed," said Wang Chu to the guard, 
"because someone told him I have a pearl of great value and he wants 
it. 
  
In truth, I lost it long ago, but the king refuses to believe me. If you turn 
me in, I shall say that you took the pearl from me and swallowed it.  
 
Your king will have you killed and turn you entrails inside out to find it.  
 
If you want to turn me over to your ruler I cannot dissuade you by 
offering you anything, but remember, if I am taken, it is your vitals 
which will be chopped to pieces."  
 
The guard promptly let Chu go. 
 
Ming Dynasty China 
 
The Ming emperor Huidi had disposed of all his uncles except one who 
feigned madness (see Chapter 27). In 1403, this very uncle, the prince 
of Yan, led a huge army to the capital of Nanjing to seize the throne.  
 
The city was surrounded and the emperor was considering suicide 
when he was stopped by a eunuch who told him that his grandfather, 
Emperor Hong Wu, had left a chest in his care with orders that, should 
any great crisis occur to threaten the dynasty, the reigning emperor 
should open the chest. 
 
"Let us open it at once then," said the emperor, "and see what my 
grandfather would do were he here now" 
 
When the lid was lifted, the box was found to contain the robes of a 
Buddhist monk, a diploma, a razor, and ten ingots of silver.

The emperor understood the meaning at once and with a handful of 
attendants fled the palace through a secret tunnel to a Buddhist temple. 
There he shaved his head and put on the robes. He made his way out of 
the city and all the way to Sichuan province where he lived in obscurity 
in a remote monastery.  
 
Meanwhile the palace had burned down during the fighting and it was 
assumed that the emperor had died in the fire. 
 
Forty years later during the reign of Emperor Ying Zong (the fourth 
since Huidi's time), an old Buddhist priest arrived at court and claimed 
to be the old emperor Huidi. It turned out the man was an impostor, but 
a rumor began that Huidi was still alive.  
 
To quell the rumors and settle the issue, an official investigation was 
made which discovered that Huidi was indeed still alive and living as a 
Buddhist priest. The old emperor was invited back to the capital with 
great ceremony and he lived out his last days as a guest in the palace. 
However, he was kept under a watchful eye! 
 
Summary 
 
The ancient Daoist sages invented the principle of "non-action," or 
"following the course of the times." To not take advantage of an 
opportunity presented is a violation of this principle. Conversely, to 
fight a battle that cannot be won is an equal violation of heaven's law.  
 
In the art of war, an often overlooked but vital talent is knowing when 
to run.
