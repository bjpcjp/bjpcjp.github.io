It is the gnarled and crooked tree that escapes the 
woodsman's axe. 
 
Lao Zi, The Tao Te Ching 
 
When an eagle is about to attack, it will fly low and draw in 
its wings. When a fierce cat is about to strike, it will fold back 
its ears and crouch low. When the Sage is about to move, he 
will certainly display a stupid countenance.

Hide behind the mask of a fool, a drunk, or a madman to create 
confusion about your intentions and motivations. Lure your opponent 
into underestimating your ability until, overconfident, he drops his 
guard. Then you may attack.

Warring States Period China 
 
Sun Bin was making a reputation for himself after graduating from the 
mysterious Ghost Valley School when he was invited to become an 
advisor to the king of Wei. 20 Another advisor at the court, Pang Juan, 
became jealous of Sun Bin's increasing popularity with the king and 
devised a scheme to frame Sun as a traitor. He convinced Sun that he 
should write to his family and plan a return trip home to show off his 
success. 
 
Sun was concerned about taking a leave from the court so soon after his 
appointment, but Pang reassured him that this was customary in Wei. 
Sun complied and wrote a letter to his family announcing his 
forthcoming visit. Pang had the letter intercepted and brought it to the 
king explaining that, since Sun had only spent three months at court, 
his imminent return could only mean that he was a spy and was 
planning to return with state secrets. 
 
The king was outraged and he had Sun imprisoned and the tendons 
behind his knees cut, hence Sun's first name Bin, meaning "crippled." 
A year later, Sun heard that an emissary from his home state would be 
visiting Wei, and he planned to escape. 
 
First, he feigned madness to relax the guard's vigil. He rubbed his own 
feces over his body and alternately screamed and wept, and then 
convulsed with laughter. Pang suspected this to be an act and so he 
tested him by placing a bowl of food and a bowl of feces through the 
bars. Sun ignored the delicious food and ate the contents of the other 
bowl instead. 
 
Convinced Sun had truly gone insane, Pang and the prison guards soon 
forgot about the "mad" prisoner. When the embassy from Yue arrived, 
                                                      
20 Probably the most famous of the many rustic ‘academies’ that have existed 
in China since ancient times to train men in the arts of war. Typically these 
schools taught strategy, diplomacy, and martial arts. A tradition that Guigu 
Xiansheng (The Sage of Ghost Valley) was the teacher of renowned Warring 
States generals Sun Bin and Pang Juan is also considered to be a late 
confabulation.

they received a secret message detailing Sun's plight. Determined to 
rescue their fellow countryman they sought permission to visit with the 
famous but now insane strategist.  
 
The king gave his consent and, since the guards paid little attention, 
they were able to switch Sun for a double who volunteered to take his 
place. Sun was secretly spirited back to Yue where he went on to 
conquer Wei and kill Pang Juan using another famous tactic. (see 
Chapter 28) 
 
Sui Dynasty China 
  
During the final years of Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty, there 
appeared a ballad that foretold the fall of the house of Sui and the 
ascent of a man named Li as emperor. The ballad became immensely 
popular among the disaffected subjects of Emperor Yang's infamous 
rule.  
 
The emperor, being superstitious and believing in the prophesy himself, 
began a campaign to search out and execute anyone of importance with 
the surname Li. He had numerous ministers and officials along with 
their entire families put to the sword. 
 
A minor official by the name of Li Yuan was serving as superintendent 
in the provinces when he was summoned to the court. Li Yuan delayed 
appearing in court by claiming poor health.  
 
Li Yuan had a niece who was a palace maid. One day the emperor 
asked her where her uncle Li had been. The lady replied that her uncle 
was ill. The emperor said, "I wonder if he is courting death?" 
 
When Li Yuan got word of this, he was certain that if he obeyed the 
summons to court he would never return. Thereupon he feigned 
madness and pretended to become an incorrigible drunk. When the 
imperial spies reported Li's behavior the emperor thought that a 
madmen could never fulfill the prophesy and was no longer suspicious 
of Li. 
 
Surprisingly, two years later the Sui emperor placed Li in charge of a 
field army to defend the empire against barbarian incursions. Li fought

bravely, won the respect of his troops, marched on the capital, and went 
on to found the illustrious Tang dynasty, thus fulfilling the prophecy. 
 
Ming Dynasty China 
 
Just before his death in 1398, the founder of the Ming dynasty, Hongwu, 
bequeathed that the throne be passed over his sons to his grandson 
Huidi. Only sixteen when he was appointed emperor, Huidi was 
counseled by treacherous advisors to eliminate the other branches of 
the family. One by one, the young emperor's uncles were summoned to 
court to answer to charges of corruption. Always found guilty, they 
were stripped of their rank, reduced to the status of commoner, and 
exiled to a remote district. 
 
One of the uncles, the prince of Shang, refused the summons and, in 
protest, set fire to his palace, burning his family to death. Then, 
mounting his terrified horse, he charged into the fire to his meet his 
own death. 
 
A year later, five of the princes had been eliminated, leaving only one 
uncle that still retained position in the government: the prince of Yan.  
 
The prince was alone and isolated, waiting for the inevitable summons 
to court which he could not refuse since, in keeping with tradition, his 
own sons were held as hostages in the capital. To give himself time to 
plan a way of saving himself, he feigned madness.  
 
He ran through the streets of Beijing screaming and yelling, stealing 
food and wine, and sleeping in gutters. For days he sank into deep 
depressions and would see no one. In warm weather he sat by the stove, 
shivering and complaining of the cold. 
 
But it was all a smoke screen meant to deceive the emperor. When the 
emperor heard these reports he said, "Alas, my poor uncle has gone 
truly insane. Let us release his sons to him in the hope that they may 
bring him back to reason."  
 
This was the young emperor's fatal mistake. With his sons' safe, the 
prince of Yan was free to openly challenge the emperor's authority.

He raised an army and by 1402 the young emperor was dead and the 
prince of Yan assumed the throne as Emperor Yongle, one of the Ming 
dynasty's greatest rulers. 
  
Summary 
 
It is well known that the strongest contender in any sphere of activity 
automatically fears, and therefore becomes an enemy to the second 
strongest. To hide your strength, feign madness since without the 
power of rational thought, all other powers are useless. When you cease 
being a threat, hostile attentions will be focused on the next most 
powerful. This buys you time to scheme for victory.
