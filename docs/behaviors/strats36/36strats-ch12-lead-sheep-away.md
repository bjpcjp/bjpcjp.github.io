Seize the Opportunity to Lead a Sheep Away 
While following the rules of strategy and tactics be prepared 
to take advantage of circumstances not covered by 
conventional thinking. If opportunities present themselves, 
then the leader should be flexible in his plans and adapt to 
the new circumstances. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
While carrying out your plans be flexible enough to take advantage of 
any opportunity that presents itself, however small, and avail yourself 
of any profit, however slight. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
In 770 B.C. The duke of Chen joined forces with Liu and Qi and 
together they attacked Song. Since the main body of the Chen army 
was on campaign, the duke of Song used the strategy Attack Wei to 
Rescue Zhao and attacked the now poorly defended state of Chen. This

caused the duke of Chen to break off his invasion of Song and return to 
rescue his own capital. 
 
When the duke of Song heard that the Chen army was returning, he 
withdrew his army. As the Song army retreated they passed through the 
small kingdom of Tai who had remained neutral during the war 
between Chen and Song. An advisor to the duke of Song suggested that 
since the king of Tai had refused to ally himself against Chen, why not 
lay siege to the city and take their territory since they were already 
there. 
 
The duke agreed and he ordered his troops to surround the capital of 
Tai. The king of Tai was outnumbered so he sent a secret message to 
the duke of Chen asking for reinforcements. A couple of days later the 
Song scouts reported that the Chen army was approaching. Once again 
the duke of Song abandoned the field and fled back to his home 
territory. 
 
The siege lifted, the king of Tai threw open the gates and welcomed his 
new allies into the city. The duke of Chen, finding himself and his 
troops inside the walls of a foreign city saw an opportunity that occurs 
but seldom. He seized the king and made him prisoner while his troops 
quickly overcame the unsuspecting Tai guards and took control of the 
city.  
 
Duke Chen, with scarcely any fighting, was able to annex another 
kingdom to his rule. 
 
Qin Dynasty China 
 
In 209 B.C. China revolted against years of oppressive Qin rule. The 
Qin general, Chang Han, was sent out to put down the rebellion. He 
defeated the forces of Chu and then crossed the Yellow River to lay 
siege to the city of Chulu in Zhao.  
 
The King of Chu gathered his remaining divisions and placed them 
under the command of General Song Yi. As second in command he 
appointed the aristocrat general Xiang Yu and sent them to lead the 
army to rescue Zhao.

Song Yi marched the army out but stopped half-way and made camp, 
where they sat and waited for forty-six days.  
 
Xiang Yu was becoming impatient and went to see Song Yi and said, 
"News has come that the Qin army has besieged the king of Zhao at 
Chulu.  
 
If we lead our troops across the Yellow River at once, we can attack 
them with our forces from the outside, Zhao will respond by attacking 
from the city, and we are sure to defeat the Qin army." 
  
"Not so," replied Song Yi. "He who merely slaps at the gadfly on the 
cow's back will never succeed in killing the pesky lice. Qin is attacking 
Zhao. If she is victorious in battle, then her troops will be exhausted 
and we can take advantage of her weakness. If she fails, then victory 
has already been assured.  
 
Therefore it is better to let Qin and Zhao fight it out. You see, when it 
comes to fighting with a sword, I may not be a match for you, but when 
it comes to laying out strategy, you are no match for me!" 
 
After this meeting there was no love lost between the two generals and 
Song Yi secretly let it be known that he would reward anyone who 
assassinated Xiang Yu. 
 
Shortly afterwards Song Yi received orders from the king of Chu to 
send his son back to Qi to become prime minister. Delighted by his 
son's promotion, Song Yi and the entire army escorted him back to the 
capital marching for a whole day until arriving at Wuyan city.  
 
That night, and well into the next day, Song Yi and his son celebrated 
at a drinking party in the comfort of the city while the remainder of the 
army bivouacked outside. The day was cold and a heavy rain was 
falling so that the soldiers were chilled and starving. 
 
Xiang Yu had had enough and declared before the senior officers, "We 
joined forces for the purpose of attacking Qin, but instead we have sat 
here all this time without advancing.

The year is lean, the people poor, and our men eat nothing but taro 
root and pulse. We have no provisions for our army, and yet Song Yi 
holds a great drinking party.  
 
He will not lead us across the river so that we may live off the food of 
Zhao and attack Qin. Now if Qin should succeed in defeating the newly 
formed Zhao she will be stronger than before, then what sort of 
weakness will there be that we can take advantage of?  
 
Our troops suffered only a single defeat, yet we are all brought 
together under Song Yi's sole command so that the entire safety of our 
state depends on this one move.  
 
Song Yi takes no thought for our soldiers, but attends only to his 
personal affairs. He is a traitor to the altars of our soil!" 
 
Early the next morning Xiang Yu went to make his daily report to the 
supreme general. When he entered the tent, he quickly drew his sword 
and cut off Song Yi's head.  
 
Then he went outside and announced, "Song Yi was plotting with Qin 
against Chu. The king of Chu secretly sent me an order to execute 
him."  
 
All the other commanders submitted to him in fear. Xiang Yu became 
Supreme General and marched his army across the river, and in nine 
battles defeated the Qin forces.  
 
Xiang Yu went on to conquer more than half of the empire before 
losing to Gaozu, the founder of the Han dynasty. 
 
Yuan Dynasty China 
 
During the final days of the Yuan dynasty, rebellion had broken out 
throughout the empire. Initially there were several contenders vying to 
be the first to found a new dynasty on the imminent fall of the house of 
Yuan, but the field was narrowed to two: Chu Yuanchang and Chen 
Yifu. The two armies met at Poyang Lake where a naval engagement 
was to take place.

General Chen had the advantage of both troops and ships. His ships 
were large and sturdy and he had them lined up side by side across the 
entire expanse of the lake. He furthermore had the ships joined together 
with iron chains so as to create an impenetrable barrier.  
 
General Chu sent his ships to attack but they were defeated, having 
failed to break through the cordon. Fortunately for Chu, the next day a 
violent northwest gale began to blow. Since Chen's flotilla was situated 
downwind, Chu took advantage of the situation to launch fireboats 
against the barrier.  
 
Soon Chen's troops were in a frenzy to save their ships from both the 
rising storm and the fire which was fanned into a blazing fierceness by 
the wind.  
 
Taking advantage of the panic and confusion that ensued, Chu launched 
his own fleet into the attack and they completely defeated Chen's 
forces.  
 
General Chen was killed by an arrow through his eye while general 
Chu became the founder of the Ming dynasty. 
 
Summary 
 
Even the wisest planner cannot calculate certainty into his schemes. 
The element of chance is ever present and a watchful eye is needed to 
spot when the door of opportunity is opening.
