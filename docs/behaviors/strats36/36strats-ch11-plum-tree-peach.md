Know contentment, and you will suffer no disgrace. Know 
when to stop, and you will meet with no danger. You can then 
endure. 
 
Lao Zi, The Tao Te Ching 
 
There are circumstances in which you must sacrifice short term 
objectives in order to gain the long term goal. This is the scapegoat 
strategy whereby someone else suffers the consequences so that the rest 
do not.

Sun Zi's worthiest opponent was Fan Li, a general of the state of Yue. 
Against Sun Zi's advice, King Helu of Wu took the army personally to 
attack Yue. Fan Li, though outnumbered, was confident of winning, 
since the king's military abilities were not in the same league as Sun 
Zi's.

Fan Li prepared a shock tactic by scouring the kingdom's dungeons and 
prisons for condemned criminals. He offered the convicts a last chance 
to earn honor in this world and provide benefits for their families. Since 
they were to die anyway, if they sacrificed their lives on the battlefield 
instead, then their names would be restored to honor and their families 
richly rewarded. With nothing to lose, the convicts agreed. 
 
When the two armies met and were arranged into battle formations Fan 
Li gave the signal for the convicts to play their part. Dressed in Yue 
uniforms they marched to the front of the lines, drew their swords, and, 
before the horrified Wu army, cut their own throats before dropping 
dead to the ground.  
 
Taking advantage of the shock and demoralization of the Wu army, Fan 
Li quickly sent a readied detachment to attack Wu's flanks and in the 
resulting confusion defeated the Wu army.

While in residence at the Qi court, Lord Meng Zhang sent his retainer 
Feng Xuan to collect the taxes from his little fief in Xue. 
 
Before he left, Feng asked Lord Meng, "Is there anything I may buy for 
you when I return?"  
 
"If you see something my house lacks, buy it." replied the lord. 
 
Feng Xuan went to Xue and sent out officers to summon the people to 
settle their debts. When he had collected all the tallies Feng feigned that 
he had received an order from Lord Meng absolving all outstanding 
debts. He returned all the money, burned the tallies, and returned to Qi. 
 
The next day Feng called on Lord Meng who was surprised to see him 
return so soon. "Why do you return so speedily? Have the debts been 
collected?" asked Lord Meng.  
 
"They have already been collected," was the reply. 
 
"What did you purchase on your return?"

"My Lord asked me to see if there was anything your house lacked. It 
was my humble opinion that your castle was filled with precious 
objects, that your stables abounded with steeds, and the lower palaces 
with beauties. It seemed that only one thing was lacking, and that was 
fealty. This I bought my Lord." 
 
"How can one buy fealty?" asked Lord Meng. 
 
"At the moment you hold the little fief of Xue, yet you do not cherish the 
people there as your own children, but look on them as a source of 
profit," replied Feng.  
 
"Your servant took it upon himself to feign an order from you relieving 
the people of their debts and they cheered your name. That is how your 
servant purchased fealty." 
 
Lord Meng was displeased but said, "So be it! You may now rest, sir." 
 
A year later the old king of Qi died and the new king distrusted all of 
his predecessor's advisors. Lord Meng was informed he was being 
relieved of his duties and sent back to govern his own fief. Lord Meng 
and his entourage set out to return to Xue, but when they were still a 
hundred li from the city, all its people, even the elderly and children, 
came out midway to welcome their lord in joyous celebration. 
 
Lord Meng turned to Feng and said, "Your purchase of fealty on my 
behalf, sir, is apparent to me today." 
 
"My lord," replied Feng, "even the wiliest rabbit needs more than one 
bolt hole to escape to in order to survive."

On one of his campaigns Cao Cao was running short of food. He asked 
his supply sergeant what he could do. The sergeant suggested reducing 
the rations by secretly using a smaller cup to parcel out the rice.  
 
Cao Cao praised the sergeant and gave his consent to use the smaller 
measuring cup. After a few days, the soldiers began to complain and

accused their commander of cheating them. Cao Cao again called in the 
supply sergeant and told him the situation. 
 
"I will do anything I can to help, but what would you have me do?'' 
asked the sergeant. 
 
"I'm afraid I am going to have to borrow your head," replied Cao Cao 
and he had the sergeant decapitated and his head stuck on a tall pole 
with a banner that read "Caught cheating on supplies by using a 
smaller measuring cup." 
 
Summary 
 
In order to gain one thing it is often necessary to lose another. Trying to 
hold on to everything at once may cause you in the end to lose 
everything. Instead, sacrifice smaller concerns to strengthen your more 
important endeavor.
