Under hurtful accusations often lies a weak case. 
 
Chinese Proverb 
 
A lie told by one, becomes truth when told by hundreds. 
 
Chinese Proverb 
 
To discipline, control, or warn others whose status or position excludes 
them from direct confrontation, use analogy and innuendo. Without 
directly naming names, those accused cannot retaliate without revealing 
their complicity. 
 
Spring and Autumn Period China 
 
Duke Jing of Qi appointed Sima Rangchu as General of the Army to 
lead the soldiers against Qin.

Sima said, "I was formerly lowly and menial. If my lord pulls me out 
from my village and places me above the high officials, the officers and 
troops will not be submissive and the 'Hundred Surnames'' will not 
believe in me. 19 
 
Since I am insignificant and my authority light, I would like to have one 
of my lord's favored ministers, someone whom the state respects, as 
supervisor of the army. Then it will be possible." 
 
Duke Jing consented and appointed Zhuang Jia as supervisor. Sima 
met with Zhuang Jia and they agreed that they would begin the march 
at midday the next day. Sima went on ahead to the army camp where he 
gave orders to prepare for the next day's departure. He also ordered his 
guards to place a water clock in the parade grounds. 
 
The next day Zhuang, who had always been arrogant and aristocratic, 
assumed that since Sima was already at the army camp and 
preparations were underway, it was not urgent for him to be there. His 
friends and relatives from all around gathered to detain him with drinks 
and entertainment. By midday Zhuang had still not arrived so Sima 
gave orders for the army to depart. By evening Zhuang had finally 
caught up with the army. 
 
Sima asked, "How is it that you arrived after the appointed time?" 
 
Zhuang acknowledged his fault saying, "High officials and relatives 
saw this simple one off, and thus I was detained." 
 
Sima said, "On the day a general receives the mandate of command, he 
forgets his home; when he enters the army and takes control of the 
soldiers, he forgets his loved ones; when he takes hold of the drum 
sticks and urgently beats the drum, he forgets himself.  
 
At present, enemy states have already deeply invaded our lands, while 
within the state there is unrest and movement. Officers and soldiers lie 
brutally cut down and exposed on the borders.

The fate of the entire population hangs upon you, so what do you mean 
by being seen off?" 
 
Zhuang was speechless. Sima then summoned the provost marshal and 
inquired, "What is the army's law regarding those who arrive after the 
appointed time?" 
  
He replied, ''They should be beheaded!" 
 
Zhuang was terrified and sent a messenger racing back to the capital to 
have the duke issue an immediate pardon. But before the messenger 
returned with the pardon, Zhuang had already been executed.  
 
Thereafter the officials and nobles were all terrified of Sima and no one 
dared hesitate in following his orders 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
After Gaozu had become emperor he invested many of his followers. 
One day, while he was strolling along the balcony of his palace in 
Luoyang, he noticed several ministers milling about below speaking in 
hushed tones. 
 
"What are they talking about?" he asked his advisor, Zhang Liang. 
 
"Your majesty does not know?" replied Zhang, "They are plotting a 
revolt." 
 
"But peace and order have just been restored to the empire. Why 
should they be planning a revolt?" 
 
"When your majesty rose from among the common people, it was 
through these men that you seized control of the empire. You have 
become the Son of Heaven, but those whom you have invested have all 
been close friends from the old days, while you have had your enemies 
of former times executed.  
 
Now these officers of your army, reckoning up the merits they have won, 
believe that there is not sufficient land in the whole empire to invest 
them all. So, some of them fear they will not receive their just allotment,

while others tremble, lest, falling under suspicion for some error of 
their past, they be condemned to execution. Therefore they gather 
together in this way and plot rebellion." 
"What should I do?" asked the emperor. 
 
"Among all your followers whom do you dislike the most?" inquired 
Zhang Liang. 
 
"Yong Chi and I are ancient enemies," replied the emperor. "Many 
times in the past he has brought me trouble and shame. I would like to 
have killed him, but because his merit is great, I have not had the 
heart." 
 
"You must hurry and invest Yong Chi before anyone else, and make 
known what you have done to your other followers. When they see 
Yong Chi has been invested, they will all feel assured of their own 
rewards," said Zhang Liang. 
 
The emperor agreed and held a feast to bestow Yang Chi with lands 
and titles.  
 
When the other ministers left the banquet they said to each other 
happily, "If even Yong Chi can become a marquis, the rest of us have 
nothing to worry about!" 
 
Han Dynasty China 
 
In 195 B.C. Gaozu, the founder of the Han Dynasty, died. His wife, the 
Dowager Empress Lu, thereupon set about seizing power for herself 
and her clan. First, she had two princes assassinated, a third driven to 
suicide, and their kingdoms handed over to members of her own family.  
 
The empress also disposed of numerous ministers and advisors, not to 
mention all the former concubines of her late husband. Then she placed 
an infant on the throne claiming it to be the son of Gaozu when in fact 
she had stolen the infant and had the mother executed to cover the 
affair.  
 
The emperor's family line of Liu was in danger of being eclipsed by the 
newly powerful Lu clan. One marquis of the imperial line, Liu Chang,

was embittered that his family was effectively ousted from holding 
position at court, and was determined to resist the empress's designs. 
 
Once, at a banquet held at the palace, the empress appointed Liu Chang 
to act as master of wine. This was meant as an insult, being asked to 
serve at a banquet, but Liu Chang did not show any offense. He asked 
the empress, "Since I come from a family of generals, I would like to 
direct the dispensing of wine in accordance with the rules of the army."  
 
The empress, unaware of the ramifications, gave her consent. When the 
banquet was at its height Liu Chang poured wine for the empress and 
asked permission to sing a folk song that he learned as a child. The 
empress gave her permission and Liu Chang began to recite: 
 
Deep we plough and thick we sow the seed, 
We set out the little plants where they will have room to grow. 
Whatever comes up that is not from our seed, 
We hoe it out and throw it away! 
 
The empress was outraged at the obvious allusion, but she could say 
nothing without admitting her resemblance to it. Later a member of the 
entourage became drunk and slipped away from the party without 
seeking permission from the empress.  
 
Liu Chang followed the man and drew his sword and slew him. Liu 
Chang returned to the party carrying the severed head and said to the 
startled guests, "Some man tried to desert the banquet! In accordance 
with army regulations I have duly carried out the penalty of execution!" 
 
The empress and her courtiers were completely dumbfounded, but 
since the empress had given permission to conduct the service 
according to military protocol, no one could find fault with Liu's 
actions.  
 
Thereafter Liu Chang was treated with great deference by the court. 
Shortly after empress Lu passed away, the Liu clan revolted and in 
keeping with the song wiped out the entire Lu clan, except for one 
princess who was married to a marquis in a distant province.

Summary 
 
A rule of leadership states to always reward in public but to criticize in 
private. However, there are times when others need to see the possible 
consequences of their behavior by making an example of someone.
