Borrow The Road To Conquer Guo 
A samurai in service may be said to borrow his master's 
authority and also rob him of it. And similarly his lord may 
lend it to him or let him steal it.

Borrow the resources of an ally to attack a common enemy. Once the 
enemy is defeated, use those resources to turn on the ally that lent you 
them in the first place. 
 
Spring And Autumn Period China 
 
The small states of Yu and Guo bordered the larger state of Jin. Duke 
Xian of Jin desired to conquer both states. This desire was not unknown 
to the two smaller states and both had taken steps to defend their 
borders with Jin.

The duke's general, Xun Xi, suggested they make a roundabout attack at 
Guo through the state of Yu to catch them by surprise. 
 
General Xun suggested that since the duke of Yu was a greedy man he 
could be bribed with gifts of jade and horses in exchange for safe 
passage through his territory. 
 
Duke Xian objected to the idea of giving away so much treasure and 
asked, "What if the duke of Yu accepts our gifts but refuses us 
passage?'' 
 
General Xun replied, "If he doesn't intend to let us through, then he 
wouldn't accept them, but if he does accept the gifts, and he does let us 
through, then it will only mean that the treasure is stored temporarily 
in his storehouse rather than ours." 
 
When the bribe was sent to the duke of Yu one of his ministers, Gong 
Ziqi, cautioned against accepting them saying, "Yu is to Guo, like lips 
are to teeth. Our ancestors had a saying: 'If the lips are gone, the teeth 
will be exposed to cold.' Guo's existence depends on Yu, while Yu's 
ability to survive hinges on Guo.  
 
If we make way for Jin, then the day will see Guo perish in the morning 
only to be followed by Yu in the evening. Why should we ever let Jin 
pass?" 
 
The duke of Yu, however, refused to listen to this advice.  
 
Jin was given safe passage and succeeded in conquering Guo. On their 
way back they stopped to conquer Yu. After taking the Yu capital and 
recovering the treasure, General Xun returned the jade and horses to the 
duke.  
 
Duke Xian was pleased and said in good humor, "The jade is 
untouched but the horses seem to have gained some more teeth!" 
 
Warring States Period China 
 
King Xiong of Qi was of an ungenerous nature. During his father's rule, 
Qi's ablest general was Tian Dan, who had distinguished himself

during the war with Yan. When he was still the heir apparent, Xiong 
worried that the renowned general would seize the throne for himself 
after the king's death. But Tian Dan was too loyal to contemplate such a 
move and when Xiong ascended the throne he served under him as 
minister. 
 
One day while Tian Dan was inspecting the countryside, he came upon 
an old man who had just crossed a river. The water was so cold that the 
old man had collapsed on the bank, too weak to move. When Tian Dan 
saw this he dismounted and wrapped his own fur cloak around the old 
man to warm him.  
 
When King Xiong heard this he hated Tian Dan and cried aloud, "Why 
would Tian Dan do a thing like that if he did not intend to take my 
kingdom from me?17  I must have a plan to use against him now or I 
will be too late." 
 
He looked about for someone to advise him, but the court was empty. 
Looking out his balcony the king noticed a bead stringer in the street 
below and called out to him, "Did you hear what I just said?" 
 
"I did," replied the bead stringer. 
 
"And what do you think I should do about this?" asked the king. "If I 
were the king I would use him to make me appear good." 
 
 "How?" 
 
"You should praise the goodness of Tian Dan and issue a statement 
saying,  
 
'When we are troubled by famine Dan feeds them; when we grieve that 
our citizens are cold, Dan gives them the cloak from his back. When we 
are troubled over our people, Dan is troubled. In gauging his king's 
intentions, none is the equal of Dan, and I praise him.'  
 
                                                      
17 In ancient China, any official who acted in an upright and moral manner 
immediately fell under suspicion, since such behaviour was thought to be a 
first step in achieving power.

In this way Dan's virtue will become the king's virtue." 
 
"Excellent!" said the king and the next day he summoned Tian Dan to 
court. There the king bowed before Tian Dan praising his virtue and 
awarding him with honors. Then the king turned to the assembly and 
said, "If any officer should find the people cold and hungry, then he 
should receive them and provide warmth and food. In this way you 
would serve your king." 
 
The next day the king's spies returned with the report that in every 
village the people were saying, "Tian Dan's love for the people is 
nothing more than carrying out the orders of the king!" 
 
Yuan Dynasty China 
 
In 1293, the Great Kahn sent twenty thousand troops to subdue the 
island of Java under the pretext of avenging the murder and mutilation 
of a Mongol envoy sent earlier. (A more likely explanation is that the 
Mongols wished to control the lucrative spice trade in the Moluccas.)  
 
Using the strategy ‘Borrow the Road to Conquer Guo’, the Mongols 
made allies with a rebel Javanese prince and his army. Together they 
succeeded in destroying the local king. However, once the king was 
defeated the rebel prince quickly turned on his Mongol allies forcing 
them off the island.  
 
Thus the rebel prince used the Mongol sword to destroy his enemy, and 
then he used the tactic of ‘Exchange the Role of Guest for That of 
Host’ to turn on the Mongols after they had weakened themselves 
fighting the old king. 
 
Summary 
 
In the struggle for power, alliances are formed only if both parties 
believe they can profit from each other. These alliances last until one 
party no longer finds profit in the other. The aid you lend an ally might 
as easily be used against you. It depends whether your ally should find 
it more profitable to return the favor, or become your enemy.
