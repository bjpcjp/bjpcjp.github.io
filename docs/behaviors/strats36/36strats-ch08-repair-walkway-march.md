Secretly March to Chencang 
To win victory in battle, the leader must know how to use 
both direct and indirect methods. The interplay between 
direct and indirect methods generates countless tactics. 
 
Sun Zi, The Art of War 
 
Attack the enemy with two convergent forces. The first is the direct 
attack, one that is obvious and for which the enemy prepares his 
defence.  
 
The second is the indirect attack, the attack sinister, that the enemy 
does not expect and which causes him to divide his forces at the last 
minute, leading to confusion and disaster.

Warring States Period China 
 
In 270 B.C. the town of Ouyu, bordering the kingdom of Zhao, was 
besieged by Qin. The king of Zhao consulted his advisors, most of 
whom recommended against marching to save Ouyu, citing that the 
terrain was too rugged and difficult to cross. Only Zhao She suggested 
an attack regardless of the terrain. 
 
He said, "Qin is unsure whether we will attack since Ouyu is on the far 
border of our territory with difficult terrain between us. If I suddenly 
showed up, it would be like two rats in a hole - the most spirited fighter 
will win." 
 
The king approved and Zhao She left the capital at the head of the relief 
forces. However, he had marched only thirty li when he halted the army 
and began constructing a fortified encampment. For twenty-eight days 
Zhao She continued to dig trenches and erect stockades.  
 
During this time he sent out spies to patrol the countryside. They soon 
reported seeing a scouting party of Qin troops spying on the 
encampment. Zhao She ordered that these spies were to be allowed to 
escape and report back to Qin, and that he be notified the minute they 
departed. 
 
When the Qin spies reported back that Zhao was constructing a 
fortified camp the Qin general was relieved, since it meant that they 
were not going to relieve the siege. He reasoned that since Ouyu was 
not inside Zhao territory they were not really concerned about it. The 
Qin general therefore failed to prepare defences to his rear 
concentrating all his forces instead on taking the town. 
 
Unknown to the Qin general, Zhao She had broken camp the same day 
the spies departed and had followed closely behind them arriving on the 
scene only hours later. The Qin general having relaxed his guard was 
totally shocked by the sudden appearance of the Zhao forces setting up 
positions on the favorable North Hill.  
 
Caught between the Zhao forces to their rear and the Ouyu garrison in 
the front, the Qin suffered a serious defeat and were forced to flee 
across the border.

Qin Dynasty China 
 
Toward the end of the Qin dynasty there were numerous rebellions as 
the old kingdoms broke away from central imperial rule. The most 
powerful of the rebel leaders was Xiang Yu, warlord of western Chu.  
 
He proclaimed that any rebel general that succeeded in capturing the 
Qin capital would be granted the territory of Qin as reward. But when 
the capital was captured by a mere peasant rebel named Gaozu, 6 Xiang 
Yu was not pleased since he had fully expected to capture the capital 
himself. 
 
Gaozu, however, wisely refused the honour and was given instead the 
governorship of the remote province of Han. This in effect exiled 
Gaozu and spared Xiang Yu both the embarrassment and threat of his 
presence at court.  
 
The shortest path to reach Han was through a precipitous valley where 
part of the road consisted of a wooden walkway that ran along the steep 
cliff walls and which was supported by beams inserted into deep holes 
carved into the solid rock. 
 
Gaozu's advisor, Jiang Liang concerned that Xiang Yu might think 
them too much of a threat to allow them to escape said, "Would it not 
be wise to burn and destroy the wooden roadway which you have 
passed over? This would prove to the world that you have no intention 
of marching east' again and thus set Xiang Yu's mind at ease."  
 
Gaozu agreed and the army burned the walkway as they passed. 
 
                                                      
6 In Chinese written history emperors are known by several names depending 
on what point in their career the story takes place. In this instance, the founder 
of the Han Dynasty is called Liu Qi while he was a peasant, the Duke of Bei 
when he became a general, the King of Han when he was assigned the 
kingdom of that name, Liu Bang when he became emperor (although, the use 
of this name was forbidden during his lifetime and so does not appear in the 
contemporary histories ) and finally his posthumous title Gaozu. To avoid 
unnecessary confusion, I have used the posthumous title, Goazu, throughout 
this current work.

However, after a month of preparation, Gaozu was ready to march east 
and fight Xiang Yu for control of the empire. First he ordered a large 
work detail to begin repairing the wooden walkway while secretly 
sending his main force along narrow mountain trails through Chencang. 
 
When news that they were repairing the walkway reached Xiang Yu, he 
ordered the king of Yang, Chang Han, to lead an army and position 
themselves at the terminus of the walkway. There they could bottle 
Gaozu's forces in a narrow valley leaving them with no chance of 
breaking out. This was the obvious strategy for such a situation and 
Gaozu had counted on whoever was sent to oppose him to use it. 
 
Meanwhile Gaozu's general Han Xin, who had set out weeks earlier, 
came out of the mountains well behind Chang's troops waiting at the 
valley entrance. They launched a surprise attack from the rear while 
Gaozu and his troops charged out of the valley from the front. 
 
Chang was defeated but managed to escape to the capital with the 
news.  
 
Xiang Yu sent out three armies to attack Gaozu chasing him all the way 
to Zhongyang where Gaozu and the remnants of the Han army were 
trapped. Gaozu would triumph in the end but not until after he 
employed the strategy Shed Your Skin Like the Golden Cicada (see 
Chapter 21) 
 
Muromachi Period Japan 
 
In 1560 one of Japan's greatest warlords, Oda Nobunaga, then still a 
minor commander, marched his force of two thousand men to stop the 
incursion of a rival warlord, Imagawa Yoshimoto. 
 
Even though Nobunaga was outnumbered twelve to one he set out 
humming a tune. Nobunaga's scouts reported that Imagawa was resting 
his troops at a village that was nestled near a narrow gorge that 
Nobunaga knew would be ideal for a surprise attack. The scouts further 
reported that Imagawa's troops were celebrating and viewing the heads 
taken in a previous battle.

Nobunaga devised the following ploy. He made camp some distance 
away from the village. He placed numerous flags and had straw 
dummies made to give the impression that a large host had arrived. 
Imagawa's forces thus expected an attack to come from the direction of 
the enemy camp. 
 
Meanwhile, Nobunaga's troops secretly made a forced march in a wide 
circle in order to come up from behind the Imagawa encampment.  
 
Weather favoured Nobunaga's scheme, for late in the day there was a 
heavy downpour. Taking advantage of the foul weather, Nobunaga's 
troops launched a sudden attack from the rear. So unexpected was this 
attack that lmagawa first thought that a brawl had broken out among his 
own troops. Only when he saw two enemy samurai charging towards 
him did he realize he was under attack.  
 
This realization came too late, and lmagawa was beheaded and his 
troops scattered. The battle lasted only a few minutes, but it made Oda 
Nobunaga's reputation and he quickly rose to power, eventually 
becoming one of Japan's greatest warlords. 
 
Summary 
 
Against a seasoned and wary opponent, feints will prove ineffective. 
Instead one must make an actual attack to gain his attention. Once his 
forces are concentrated in defending the obvious attack, you attack 
from a second direction, thus catching him by surprise.
