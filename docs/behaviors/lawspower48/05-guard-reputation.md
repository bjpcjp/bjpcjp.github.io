LAW 5
SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION—GUARD IT WITH
YOUR LIFE
JUDGMENT
Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can
intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable, and will be
attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to
potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to
destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand
aside and let public opinion hang them.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D. 207-265), the great
general Chuko Liang, leading the forces of the Shu Kingdom, dispatched
his vast army to a distant camp while he rested in a small town with a
handful of soldiers. Suddenly sentinels hurried in with the alarming news
that an enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima Yi was approaching.
With only a hundred men to defend him, Chuko Liang’s situation was
hopeless. The enemy would finally capture this renowned leader.
Without lamenting his fate, or wasting time trying to figure out how he
had been caught, Liang ordered his troops to take down their flags, throw
open the city gates, and hide. He himself then took a seat on the most
visible part of the city’s wall, wearing a Taoist robe. He lit some incense,
strummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast
enemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not to
notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute.
Soon the army stood at the town gates. At its head was Sima Yi, who
instantly recognized the man on the wall.
Even so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its
open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the
wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat.
THE ANIMALS STRICKEN WITH THE PLAGUE
A frightful epidemic sent 
To earth by Heaven intent to vent
Its fury on a sinful world, to call 
It by its rightful name, the pestilence, 
That Acheron-filling vial of virulence
Had fallen on every animal. 
Not all were dead, but all lay near to dying, 
And none was any longer trying 
To find new fuel to feed life’s flickering fires. 
No foods excited their desires; 
No more did wolves and foxes rove
In search of harmless, helpless prey;
And dove would not consort with dove,
For love and joy had flown away. 
The Lion assumed the chair to say: 
“Dear friends, 
I doubt not it’s for heaven’s high ends
That on us sinners woe must fall. 
Let him of us who’s sinned the most 
Fall victim to the avenging heavenly host, 
And may he win salvation for us all; 
For history teaches us that in these crises 
We must make sacrifices. 
Undeceived and stern-eyed, let’s inspect 
Our conscience. 
As I recollect, 
To put my greedy appetite to sleep, 
I’ve banqueted on many a sheep 
Who’d injured me in no respect, 
And even in my time been known to try 
Shepherd pie. 
If need be, then 
I’ll die. 
Yet I suspect 
That others also ought to own their sins. 
It’s only fair that all should do their best 
To single out the guiltiest.” 
“Sire, you’re too good a king,“the Fox begins; 
“Such scruples are too delicate. 
My word, 
To eat sheep, that profane and vulgar herd. 
That’s sin? Nay. Sire, enough for such a crew 
To be devoured by such as you; 
While of the shepherds we may say 
That they deserved the worst they got. 
Theirs being the lot that over us beasts plot 
A flimsy dream-begotten sway.” 
Thus spake the Fox, and toady cheers rose high, 
While none dared cast too cold an eye 
On Tiger‘s, Bear’s, and other eminences 
Most unpardonable offences 
Each, of never mind what currish breed, 
Was really a saint, they all agreed. 
Then came the Ass, to say: “I do recall 
How once I crossed an abbey-mead 
Where hunger, grass in plenty, and withal, 
I have no doubt, some imp of greed. 
Assailed me, and I shaved a tongue’s-breadth wide 
Where frankly I’d no right to any grass.
“All forthwith fell full cry upon the Ass: 
A Wolf of some book-learning testified 
That that curst beast must suffer their despite, 
That gallskinned author of their piteous plight. 
They judged him fit for nought but gallows-bait: 
How vile, another’s grass to sequestrate! 
His death alone could expiate
A crime so heinous, as full well he learns. 
The court, as you’re of great or poor estate, 
Will paint you either white or black by turns.
THE BEST FABLES OF LA FONTAINE, JEAN DE LA FONTAINE,
1621-1695
Interpretation
Chuko Liang was commonly known as the “Sleeping Dragon.” His exploits
in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man claiming to
be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering help and
information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup; this man
was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute, though, as
the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and offered to spare
the man’s life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grateful and terrified,
the man agreed, and began supplying false information to the enemy. Liang
won battle after battle.
On another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false
documents dispatching his enemy’s troops to distant locations. Once the
troops had dispersed, he was able to capture three cities, so that he
controlled an entire corridor of the enemy’s kingdom. He also once tricked
the enemy into believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the
man to escape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully
cultivated his reputation of being the cleverest man in China, one who
always had a trick up his sleeve. As powerful as any weapon, this reputation
struck fear into his enemy.
Sima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew him
well. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the wall, he
was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense—this had to be a
game of intimidation. The man was obviously taunting him, daring him to
walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it crossed
Yi’s mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate. But so great was his
fear of Liang that he dared not risk finding out. Such is the power of
reputation. It can put a vast army on the defensive, even force them into
retreat, without a single arrow being fired.
For, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books
they 
write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous
for 
despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our friends have
our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and 
making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found. 
Montaigne, 1533-1592
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as
America’s premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in
Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his
fame. The problem was that he had no money. The museum’s asking price
was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed
to the institution’s owners even though it replaced cash up front with dozens
of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agreement with
Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed his mind, and
the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of Peale’s Museum.
Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that business was business
—the museum had been sold to Peale’s because Peale’s had a reputation
and Barnum had none.
Barnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on, his
only recourse was to ruin the reputation of Peale’s. Accordingly he
launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a
bunch of “broken-down bank directors” who had no idea how to run a
museum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale’s
stock, since the business’s purchase of another museum would invariably
spread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plummeted,
and with no more confidence in Peale’s track record and reputation, the
owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold the whole
thing to Barnum.
It took years for Peale’s to recover, and they never forgot what Barnum
had done. Mr. Peale himself decided to attack Barnum by building a
reputation for “high-brow entertainment,” promoting his museum’s
programs as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism
(hypnotism) was one of Peale’s “scientific” attractions, and for a while it
drew big crowds and was quite successful. To fight back, Barnum decided
to attack Peale’s reputation yet again.
Barnum organized a rival mesmeric performance in which he himself
apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to have fallen
deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the audience—but no matter
how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell under his spell, and many of
them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum finally announced that to prove
the little girl’s trance was real, he would cut off one of her fingers without
her noticing. But as he sharpened the knife, the little girl’s eyes popped
open and she ran away, to the audience’s delight. He repeated this and other
parodies for several weeks. Soon no one could take Peale’s show seriously,
and attendance went way down. Within a few weeks, the show closed. Over
the next few years Barnum established a reputation for audacity and
consummate showmanship that lasted his whole life. Peale’s reputation, on
the other hand, never recovered.
Interpretation
Barnum used two different tactics to ruin Peale’s reputation. The first was
simple: He sowed doubts about the museum’s stability and solvency. Doubt
is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of the bag with insidious rumors,
your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they can deny
the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a layer of
suspicion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so desperately?
Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they take the
high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If
done correctly, the sowing of rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your
rivals that in defending themselves they will make numerous mistakes. This
is the perfect weapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work
from.
Once Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the second,
gentler tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed his rivals’
reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base
of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and
draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright
slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt
you more than help you. But gentle barbs and mockery suggest that you
have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at
your rival’s expense. A humorous front can make you out as a harmless
entertainer while poking holes in the reputation of your rival.
It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. 
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900
KEYS TO POWER
The people around us, even our closest friends, will always to some extent
remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters have secret recesses
that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people could prove
disturbing if we thought about it long enough, since it would make it
impossible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this
fact, and to judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to
our eyes—clothes, gestures, words, actions. In the social realm, appearances
are the barometer of almost all of our judgments, and you must never be
misled into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden
change in your appearance, can prove disastrous.
This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and maintaining
a reputation that is of your own creation.
That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appearances,
distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are really
like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges you—a
powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic: With one
stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send people
scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear brilliant or
dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer.
In the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man named
Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and graciousness. He
became the ruler’s favorite. It was a law in Wei that “whoever rides secretly
in the ruler’s coach shall have his feet cut off,” but when Mi Tzu-hsia’s
mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending that the ruler
had given him permission. When the ruler found out, he said, “How dutiful
is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother’s sake he even forgot that he was
committing a crime making him liable to lose his feet!”
Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia
began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the ruler the other
half to eat. The ruler remarked, “You love me so much that you would even
forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!”
Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu-
hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his
reputation; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light. “This fellow
once rode in my coach under pretense of my order,” he told the courtiers
angrily, “and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.” For the same
actions that had charmed the ruler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia
now had to suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solely on the
strength of his reputation.
In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one
outstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality
sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then make your
reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care to
build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like
wildfire.
A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your
strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an
aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the
North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin
Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that
struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even when his forces were
depleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire
cities would be evacuated at the news of his approach.
As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires
respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, or
utter a single word.
Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the success
of Henry Kissinger’s shuttle diplomacy rested on his reputation for ironing
out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that Kissinger
could not sway him. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as soon as
Kissinger’s name became involved in the negotiations.
Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This
single quality—efficiency, say, or seductiveness—becomes a kind of calling
card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A
reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.
Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his
future conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely
curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so
romantically successful.
Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are
prevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate
with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name to
whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputation
for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When P. T.
Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar
entertainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had
a stellar, high-class reputation, and the American tour Barnum sponsored
for her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons
of nineteenth-century America were long unable to rid themselves of a
reputation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began
collecting art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently
associated with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften
their unpleasant image.
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Especially
when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, anticipating all
attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or defensive at
the slanderous comments of your enemies—that reveals insecurity, not
confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and never appear
desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack on another
man’s reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you have less power
than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, and your own thus-
far-small reputation gives him a small target when he tries to return your
fire. Barnum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career. But this
tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in petty
vengeance. If you do not break your enemy’s reputation cleverly, you will
inadvertently ruin your own.
Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed electricity,
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct current
(DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have succeeded
in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was furious.
He determined to ruin Tesla’s reputation, by making the public believe that
the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in promoting
it.
To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted them
to death with an AC current. When this wasn’t enough, in 1890 he got New
York State prison authorities to organize the world’s first execution by
electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison’s electrocution experiments
had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man
was only half killed. In perhaps the country’s cruelest state-authorized
execution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.
Although, in the long run, it is Edison’s name that has survived, at the
time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla’s. He
backed off. The lesson is simple—never go too far in attacks like these, for
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtler tactics,
such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your opponent while making you out
as a charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his
path—any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.

Authority: Therefore I should wish our courtier to bolster up his inherent
worth with skill and cunning, and ensure that whenever he has to go where
he is a stranger, he is preceded by a good reputation.... For the fame which
appears to rest on the opinions of many fosters a certain unshakable belief
in a man’s worth which
