LAW 39
STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH
JUDGMENT
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always
stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while
staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-
balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them
and you hold the strings.
ITAKURA SHIGEMUNE GRINDS HIS OWN TEA
The Kyoto Shoshidai ltakura Suwo-no-kami Shigemune was very fond of
Cha-no-yu (the tea ceremony), and used to grind his own tea while sitting in
the court as judge. And the reason was this, He once asked a friend of his
who was his companion in Cha-no-yu, a tea merchant named Eiki, to tell
him frankly what was the public opinion about him. “Well,” said Eiki, “they
say that you get irritated with those who don’t give their evidence very
clearly and scold them, and so people are afraid to bring lawsuits before
you and if they do, the truth does not come out.” “Ah, I am glad you have
told me that,” replied Shigemune, “for now that I consider it, I have fallen
into the habit of speaking sharply to people in this way, and no doubt
humble folk and those who are not ready in speech get flurried and are
unable to put their case in the best light. I will see to it that this does not
occur in the future.” So after this he had a tea mill placed before him in
court and in front of it the paper-covered shoji were drawn to, and
Shigemune sat behind them and ground the tea and thus kept his mind calm
while he heard the cases. And he could easily see whether his composure
was ruffied or not by looking at the tea, which would not fall evenly ground
to the proper consistency if he got excited. And so justice was done
impartially and people went away from his court satisfied.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried back to Paris
from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had confirmed a rumor that
his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired against him with Fouché, the
minister of police. Immediately on arriving in the capital the shocked
emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following them into the
meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down, and started
rambling vaguely about plotters working against him, speculators bringing
down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies—and his own
ministers undermining him.
As Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking
completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced,
“For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to
doubt.” At the word “treason” the ruler expected his minister to be afraid.
But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.
The sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges that
could get him hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers,
he said, who wanted him dead, and he took a step closer to Talleyrand—
who stared back at him unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. “You are a
coward,” he screamed in Talleyrand’s face, “a man of no faith. Nothing is
sacred to you. You would sell your own father. I have showered you with
riches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me.” The other
ministers looked at each other in disbelief—they had never seen this
fearless general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged.
“You deserve to be broken like glass,” Napoleon continued, stamping. “I
have the power to do it, but I have too much contempt for you to bother.
Why didn’t I have you hanged from the gates of the Tuileries? But there is
still time for that.” Yelling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes
bulging, he went on, “You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk
stocking.... What about your wife? You never told me that San Carlos was
your wife’s lover?” “Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this
information had any bearing on Your Majesty’s glory or my own,” said
Talleyrand calmly, completely unflustered. After a few more insults,
Napoleon walked away. Talleyrand slowly crossed the room, moving with
his characteristic limp. As an attendant helped him with his cloak, he turned
to his fellow ministers (all afraid they would never see him again), and said,
“What a pity, gentlemen, that so great a man should have such bad
manners.”
Despite his anger, Napoleon did not arrest his foreign minister. He merely
relieved him of his duties and banished him from the court, believing that
for this man humiliation would be punishment enough. He did not realize
that word had quickly spread of his tirade—of how the emperor had
completely lost control of himself, and how Talleyrand had essentially
humiliated him by maintaining his composure and dignity. A page had been
turned: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool
under fire. A feeling spread that he was on the way down. As Talleyrand
later said, “This is the beginning of the end.”
Interpretation
This was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six years
ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat, crystallizing in 1812
with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand was the first to see the
signs of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in
1808, the minister decided that for the future peace of Europe, Napoleon
had to go. And so he conspired with Fouché.
It is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a ploy—a
device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe that two of
the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their plotting.
They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad Napoleon into a
misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tantrum that laid out his loss of
control for all to see. In fact, Napoleon’s soon-famous blowup that
afternoon had a profoundly negative effect on his public image.
This is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike fear
and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, other
responses emerge—embarrassment and uneasiness about the shouter’s
capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has been said.
Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated accusations.
A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you are gone.
In the face of a conspiracy against him, a conspiracy between his two
most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel angry and
anxious. But by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he only
demonstrated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show that you
have lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action of the child
who resorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful never reveal this
kind of weakness.
There were a number of things Napoleon could have done in this
situation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible
men had had reason to turn against him, and could have listened and learned
from them. He could have tried to win them back to him. He could even
have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or death an ominous
display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing after-
effects—just a quiet and definitive severing of ties.
Remember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They only
create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weakness,
these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.
If possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone.... To speak angrily to a
person, to show your hatred by what you say or by the way you look, is an
unnecessary proceeding-dangerous, foolish, ridiculous, and vulgar.
Anger or hatred should never be shown otherwise than in what you do; and
feelings will be all the more effective in action in so far as you avoid the
exhibition of them in any other way. It is only the cold-blooded animals
whose bite is poisonous.
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER. 1788-1860
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
By the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of assuming
total control over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong and unified
leadership. As regent to the empress Zauditu (stepdaughter of the late
queen) and heir to the throne, Selassie had spent several years weakening
the power of Ethiopia’s various warlords. Now only one real obstacle stood
in his way: the empress and her husband, Ras Gugsa. Selassie knew the
royal couple hated him and wanted to get rid of him, so to cut short their
plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of
Begemeder, forcing him to leave the capital, where the empress lived.
For several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator. But Selassie did
not trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting revenge.
As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot only
increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get under his
skin, and push him into action before he was ready.
For several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in virtual
rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages and
refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them
grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an army
against these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but inwardly he seethed
—he had no grudge against the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that he fight
them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he worked to put
together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor—that Selassie was in
cahoots with the pope, and planned to convert the country to Roman
Catholicism and make it a colony of Italy. Gugsa’s army swelled, and some
of the tribes from which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight Selassie.
In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to march, not on
the Azebu Gallas but south, toward the capital of Addis Ababa. Made
confident by his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a holy war to
depose Selassie and put the country back in the hands of true Christians.
He did not see the trap that had been laid for him. Before Selassie had
ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the
Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed
several of Gugsa’s key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army
marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that
the highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the true Christian
leader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for fomenting
a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the holy
crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa’s allies had
promised him failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect.
When the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to
surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught
over her husband’s death, died a few days later. On April 30, Selassie issued
a formal proclamation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia.
THE MONKEY AND THE WASP
A monkey, whilst munching a ripe pear, was pestered by the bare-faced
importunities of a wasp, who, nolens volens, would have a part. After
threatening the monkey with his anger if he further hesitated to submit to
his demand, he settled on the fruit; but was as soon knocked off by the
monkey. The irritable wasp now had recourse to invective —and, after
using the most insulting language, which the other calmly listened to, he so
worked himself up into violent passion that, losing all consideration of the
penalty, he flew to the face of the monkey, and stung him with such rage that
he was unable to extricate his weapon, and was compelled to tear himself
away, leaving it in the wound—thus entailing on himself a lingering death,
accompanied by pains much greater than those he had inflicted.
FABLES, JONATHAN BIRCH, 1783-1847
Interpretation
Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras
Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much
greater than if he forced Gugsa to act on Selassie’s terms. So he goaded him
into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking him to fight people he
had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out
ahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa’s rebellion would come to nothing,
and that he could use it to do away with his last two enemies.
This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your opponents
have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and control. So
stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before they are
ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on
uncontrollable emotions—pride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred
up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become,
the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you
have made, and they drown.
DITCH HIGH PRIEST
Kin ’yo, an officer of the second rank, had a brother called the High Priest
Ryogaku, an extremely bad-tempered man. Next to his monastery grew a
large nettle-tree which occasioned the nickname people gave him, the
Nettle-tree High Priest. “That name is outrageous,”said the high priest,
and cut down the tree. The stump still being left, people referred to him now
as the Stump High Priest. More furious than ever, Ryogaku had the stump
dug up and thrown away, but this left a big ditch. People now called him the
Ditch High Priest.

KEYS TO POWER
Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems
out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too
seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They
are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take
personally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify
power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of
helplessness. People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, but in the
end they lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a
person with so little self-control.
The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional responses.
For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange behavior.
Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that nothing
in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.
Everyone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the present
moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our childhood, from the
problems of our parents which stem from their own childhood, on and on.
Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An
individual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much
more complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to us. If a
person explodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what
you did to them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively
directed at you—do not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way
back in time, involves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the
bother to understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the
emotional outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or
punish you cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.
This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more
clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming ensnared in
people’s emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You
keep your head while they are losing theirs.
During an important battle in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the third
century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts‘ao Ts’ao discovered documents
showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy, and
urged him to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the documents
burned and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the battle, to get
upset or demand justice would have reverberated against him: An angry
action would have called attention to the generals’ disloyalty, which would
have harmed the troops’ morale. Justice could wait—he would deal with the
generals in time. Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept his head and made the right decision.
Compare this to Napoleon’s response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking the
conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like Ts‘ao
Ts’ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took. The more
powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Talleyrand, or to
bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him later.
Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive without
options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to
control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a
position of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional
responses of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their
manhood, and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their
faces. Do as Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape
artist Kleppini: Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the
combination for a pair of cuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you
can beat him with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than
you are, taunting them into a rash action.
Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch‘i and loyal disciple of Sun-tzu,
once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered him two
to one. “Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters Wei,”
suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty thousand
on the third.” On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, “I knew the men
of Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than half of them
have deserted!” So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy infantry, the
general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the Ch’I camp
with a lightly armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring Wei’s army
into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them. With the Wei
general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily defeated the rest
of his army.
In the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no
response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man
who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your
advantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither
mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse.
When they embarrass themselves with a temper tantrum, you will have
gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their
childishness you have maintained your dignity and composure.
Image: The Pond of Fish. The waters 
are clear and calm, and the fish are well below the surface. 
Stir the waters and they emerge. Stir it some more and they get 
angry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near—
including a freshly baited hook.
 
 
Authority: If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate him. If he is
arrogant, try to encourage his egotism.... One who is skilled at making the
enemy move does so by creating a situation according to which the enemy
will act; he entices the enemy with something he is certain to take. He keeps
the enemy on the move by holding out bait and then attacks him with
picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)
REVERSAL
When playing with people’s emotions you have to be careful. Study the
enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.
