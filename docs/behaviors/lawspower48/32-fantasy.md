LAW 32
PLAY TO PEOPLE’S FANTASIES
JUDGMENT
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal
to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes from
disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can
manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert:
Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies
of the masses.
THE FUNERAL OF THE LIONESS
The lion having suddenly lost his queen, every one hastened to show
allegiance to the monarch, by offering consolation. These compliments,
alas, served but to increase the widower’s affliction. Due notice was given
throughout the kingdom that the funeral would be performed at a certain
time and place; the lion’s officers were ordered to be in attendance, to
regulate the ceremony, and place the company according to their respective
rank. One may well judge no one absented himself. The monarch gave way
to his grief, and the whole cave, lions having no other temples, resounded
with his cries. After his example, all the courtiers roared in their different
tones. A court is the sort of place where everyone is either sorrowful, gay,
or indifferent to everything, just as the reigning prince may think fit; or if
any one is not actually, he at least tries to appear so; each endeavors to
mimic the master. It is truly said that one mind animates a thousand bodies,
clearly showing that human beings are mere machines. But let us return to
our subject. The stag alone shed no tears. How could he, forsooth? The
death of the queen avenged him; she had formerly strangled his wife and
son. A courtier thought fit to inform the bereaved monarch, and even
affirmed that he had seen the stag laugh. The rage of a king, says Solomon,
is terrible, and especially that of a lion-king. “Pitiful forester!” he
exclaimed, “darest thou laugh when all around are dissolved in tears? We
will not soil our royal claws with thy profane blood! Do thou, brave wolf,
avenge our queen, by immolating this traitor to her august manes. ”
Hereupon the stag replied: “Sire, the time for weeping is passed; grief is
here superfluous. Your revered spouse appeared to me but now, reposing on
a bed of roses; I instantly recognized her. ‘Friend,’ said she to me, ‘have
done with this funereal pomp, cease these useless tears. I have tasted a
thousand delights in the Elysian fields, conversing with those who are saints
like myself. Let the king’s despair remain for some time unchecked, it
gratifies me.’” Scarcely had he spoken, when every one shouted: “A
miracle! a miracle!” The stag, instead of being punished, received a
handsome gift. Do but entertain a king with dreams, flatter him, and tell
him a few pleasant fantastic lies: whatever his indignation against you may
be, he will swallow the bait, and make you his dearest friend.
FABLES, JEAN DE LA FONTAINE, 1621-1695
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
The city-state of Venice was prosperous for so long that its citizens felt their
small republic had destiny on its side. In the Middle Ages and High
Renaissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest
city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venetians
enjoyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth
century their fortunes suddenly changed. The opening of the New World
transferred power to the Atlantic side of Europe—to the Spanish and
Portuguese, and later the Dutch and English. Venice could not compete
economically and its empire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the
devastating loss of a prized Mediterranean possession, the island of Cyprus,
captured from Venice by the Turks in 1570.
Now noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A
kind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a
glittering past—had either lived through it or heard stories about it from
their elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The
Venetians half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on
them, and that the old days would soon return. For the time being, though,
what could they do?
In 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far away
of a mysterious man called “Il Bragadino,” a master of alchemy, a man who
had won incredible wealth through his ability, it was said, to multiply gold
through the use of a secret substance. The rumor spread quickly because a
few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland had heard a
learned man prophesy that Venice would recover her past glory and power
if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art of manufacturing
gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this Bragadino possessed
—he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands, and golden objects filled
his palace—some began to dream: Through him, their city would prosper
again.
Members of Venice’s most important noble families accordingly went
together to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his palace and
watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making abilities, taking a pinch
of seemingly worthless minerals and transforming it into several ounces of
gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of extending an
official invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city’s expense, when
word suddenly reached them that they were competing with the Duke of
Mantua for his services. They heard of a magnificent party in Bragadino’s
palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons, gold watches,
gold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bragadino to Mantua,
the senate voted almost unanimously to invite him to Venice, promising him
the mountain of money he would need to continue living in his luxurious
style—but only if he came right away.
Late that year the mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With his
piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs
that accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and impressive. He
took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca, with
the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and all his other
whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street corners,
hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparatus, bellows, how-to books on the
subject. Everyone began to practice alchemy—everyone except Bragadino.
The alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the gold
that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only increased his
popularity and following; people thronged from all over Europe, even Asia,
to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts pouring in to
Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle that the
Venetians confidently expected him to produce. Eventually the citizens
began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first the
senators warned them not to hurry him—he was a capricious devil, who
needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder too, and
the senate came under pressure to show a return on the city’s ballooning
investment.
Bragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them. He
had, he said, already deposited in the city’s mint the mysterious substance
with which he multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at once,
and produce double the gold, but the more slowly the process took place,
the more it would yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a casket, the
substance would multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over. Most of the
senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino promised. Others,
however, were angry: seven more years of this man living royally at the
public trough! And many of the common citizens of Venice echoed these
sentiments. Finally the alchemist’s enemies demanded he produce a proof
of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon.
Lofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice, in
its impatience, had betrayed him, and would therefore lose his services. He
left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the
invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had
known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own
profligacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist’s
services. And so Bragadino resumed the comfortable arrangement he had
known in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself.
Interpretation
The young Cypriot Mamugnà had lived in Venice for several years before
reincarnating himself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had
settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some
indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on
sleight of hand, Mamugnà mastered human nature. With Venice as his target
from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his alchemy
scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. There he
created a reputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From a distance,
in fact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive.
At first Mamugnà did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince people
of his alchemic skill. His sumptuous palace, his opulent garments, the clink
of gold in his hands, all these provided a superior argument to anything
rational. And these established the cycle that kept him going: His obvious
wealth confirmed his reputation as an alchemist, so that patrons like the
Duke of Mantua gave him money, which allowed him to live in wealth,
which reinforced his reputation as an alchemist, and so on. Only once this
reputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over him,
did he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however,
people were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Venetian senators
who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they failed
to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, from which he slipped gold dust into
his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the alchemist of
their fantasies—and once he had created an aura like this, no one noticed
his simple deceptions.
Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in times
of scarcity and decline. People rarely believe that their problems arise from
their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out there is to
blame—the other, the world, the gods—and so salvation comes from the
outside as well. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a detailed
analysis of the reasons behind the city’s economic decline, and of the hard-
nosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would have been
scorned. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful—mostly the
kind of hard work that the citizens’ ancestors had mustered to create an
empire. Fantasy, on the other hand—in this case the romance of alchemy—
was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.
To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around you—
and pleasure comes from playing to people’s fantasies. Never promise a
gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the moon, the
great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.
No man need despair of gaining converts to the most extravagant 
hypothesis who has art enough to represent it in favorable colors.
David Hume, 1711-1776
If you want to tell lies that will be believed, don’t tell the truth that won’t.

CENTURY
KEYS TO POWER
Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the humdrum
and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to
take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of
decline and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden
recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality
only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which their
city restored its fabulous wealth and power overnight, turning dust into
gold.
The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has access
to untold power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the
masses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us all.
Never be distracted by people’s glamorous portraits of themselves and their
lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them. Once you find that,
you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands.
Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the
oppressive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they
provide:
 
The Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit of
luck, a fair amount of self-sacrifice, and a lot of patience.
The Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in one’s
fortunes, bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one fantastic
stroke.
 
This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who prowl
among us to this day, and was the key to Bragadino’s success. Promise a
great and total change—from poor to rich, sickness to health, misery to
ecstasy—and you will have followers.
How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard Thurneisser
become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg without ever
studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches, and foul-
tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thurneisser offered sweet-
tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable courtiers
especially wanted his solution of “drinkable gold,” which cost a fortune. If
some inexplicable illness assailed you, Thurneisser would consult a
horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a fantasy—
health and well-being without sacrifice and pain!
 
The Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We
understand these limits and know that we have to move within the same
familiar circles, day in and day out.
The Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world with different codes and the
promise of adventure.
 
In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious
stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from
what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa (now
Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford University engaged Psalmanazar to
teach the island’s language; a few years later he translated the Bible into
Formosan, then wrote a book—an immediate best-seller—on Formosa’s
history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the young man, and
everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with wondrous stories of his
homeland, and its bizarre customs.
After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact
merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about
Formosa—its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture—he had
invented. He had built on the English public’s ignorance of the place to
concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and
strange. British culture’s rigid control of people’s dangerous dreams gave
him the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.
The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must not
come too close, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it can
be seen, grasped, and then tired of—the fate of most courtesans. The bodily
charms of the mistress only whet the master’s appetite for more and
different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must
remain to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari,
for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I,
had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of
being strange and exotic, unknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she
worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of social codes.
Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief
from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the
working world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the
recovery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible participation of an
alluring Mexican señorita and a connection to the president of a South
American country—anything offering release from the humdrum.
 
The Reality: Society is fragmented and full of conflict.
The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union of souls.
 
In the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of the
age-old Sir Francis Drake swindle—basically promising any sucker who
happened to be surnamed “Drake” a substantial share of the long-lost
“Drake treasure,” to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the
Midwest fell for the scam, which Hartzell cleverly turned into a crusade
against the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake
fortune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical
union of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings.
Promise such a union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous
power that can easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to
play on.
 
The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past cannot be
changed. The Fantasy: A sudden reversal of this intolerable fact.
 
This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety.
The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been
recognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In
the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts
were called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Possession of
these new Vermeers would crown a collector’s career. It was like the
resurrection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back
to life. The past had been changed.
Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a
middle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen
Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would
seem real precisely because the public, and the experts as well, so
desperately wanted to believe they were.
Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and
promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then,
should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be too
direct in describing the fantasy—keep it vague. As a forger of fantasies, let
your victim come close enough to see and be tempted, but keep him far
away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.
Image: The 
Moon. Unattainable, 
always changing shape, 
disappearing and reappear- 
ing. We look at it, imagine, 
wonder, and pine—never fa-

of dreams. Do not offer 
the obvious. Promise 
the moon.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Authority: A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embellished into
a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic conception. Truth is
cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A lie is more palatable. The
most detested person in the world is the one who always tells the truth, who
never romances.... I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance
than to tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid,” 1875-1976)
REVERSAL
If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also
danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of play—the public half
realizes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the
entertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are
providing. So keep it light—never come too close to the place where you
are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely
hazardous.
After Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the sober-
minded Bavarians had far less faith in al
