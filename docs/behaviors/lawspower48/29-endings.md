TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 1510 a ship set out from the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the
Dominican Republic) for Venezuela, where it was to rescue a besieged
Spanish colony. Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a
provision chest: Vasco Núñez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come to
the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had escaped
his creditors by hiding in the chest.
There are very few men—and they are the exceptions—who are able to
think and feel beyond the present moment.
 
CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, 1780-1831
 
Balboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had returned to
Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undiscovered
kingdom called El Dorado. Balboa was one of the first adventurers to come
in search of Columbus’s land of gold, and he had decided from the
beginning that he would be the one to find it, through sheer audacity and
single-mindedness. Now that he was free of his creditors, nothing would
stop him.
Unfortunately the ship’s owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fer
nández de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered
that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before they found
any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to rescue
had been abandoned. This was Balboa’s chance. He told the sailors of his
previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors he had heard of gold in the
area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa’s life, and to
establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new settlement
“Darien.”
Darien’s first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let
others steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the sailors,
who eventually made it clear that they preferred him as governor. Enciso
fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when a representative of the
Spanish crown arrived to establish himself as the new, official governor of
Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain, this man
drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law, Balboa had
murdered the governor and usurped his position.
Balboa’s bravado had got him out of scrapes before, but now his hopes of
wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to El Dorado, should he
discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king—which, as an
outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution. Panamanian
Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of the Central
American isthmus, and had said that by traveling south upon this western
coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a name that to his
ears sounded like “Biru.” Balboa decided he would cross the treacherous
jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe his feet in this
new ocean. From there he would march on El Dorado. If he did this on
Spain’s behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the king, and would
secure his own reprieve—only he had to act before Spanish authorities
came to arrest him.
THE TWO FROGS
Two frogs dwelt in the same pool. The pool being dried up under the
summer’s heat, they left it, and set out together to seek another home. As
they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with
water, on seeing which one of the frogs said to the other: “Let us descend
and make our abode in this well, it will furnish us with shelter and food.”
The other replied with greater caution: “But suppose the water should fail
us, how can we get out again from so great a depth?” Do nothing without a
regard to the consequences.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
 
In 1513, then, Balboa set out, with 190 soldiers. Halfway across the
isthmus (some ninety miles wide at that point), only sixty soldiers
remained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditions—the blood-
sucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a mountaintop,
Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days
later he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile
and claiming all its seas, lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish
throne.
Look to the end, no matter what it is you are considering. Often enough,
God gives a man a glimpse of happiness, and then utterly ruins him.
THE HISTORIES, HERODOTUS, FIFTH CENTURY B.C.
Indians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious
pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these had
come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But Balboa
had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he should return
to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token of good will, and ask
for a large army to aid him in the conquest of El Dorado.
When news reached Spain of Balboa’s bold crossing of the isthmus, his
discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest of El Dorado, the
former criminal became a hero. He was instantly proclaimed governor of
the new land. But before the king and queen received word of his discovery,
they had already sent a dozen ships, under the command of a man named
Pedro Arias Dávila, “Pedrarias,” with orders to arrest Balboa for murder
and to take command of the colony. By the time Pedrarias arrived in
Panama, he had learned that Balboa had been pardoned, and that he was to
share the governorship with the former outlaw.
All the same, Balboa felt uneasy. Gold was his dream, El Dorado his only
desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over, and to
share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable. He also
soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter man, and equally
unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Balboa was to
seize the initiative by proposing to cross the jungle with a larger army,
carrying ship-building materials and tools. Once on the Pacific coast, he
would create an armada with which to conquer the Incas. Surprisingly
enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan—perhaps sensing it would never work.
Hundreds died in this second march through the jungle, and the timber they
carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as usual, was undaunted—no
power in the world could thwart his plan—and on arriving at the Pacific he
began to cut down trees for new lumber. But the men remaining to him
were too few and too weak to mount an invasion, and once again Balboa
had to return to Darien.
Pedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new plan, and
on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by Francisco
Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first crossing of the
isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred soldiers, Pizarro
surrounded his former friend, arrested him, and returned him to Pedrarias,
who tried him on charges of rebellion. A few days later Balboa’s head fell
into a basket, along with those of his most trusted followers. Years later
Pizarro himself reached Peru, and Balboa’s deeds were forgotten.
THE KING, THE SUFI, AND THE SURGEON
In ancient times a king of Tartary was out walking with some of his
noblemen. At the roadside was an abdal (a wandering Sufi), who cried out:
“Whoever will give me a hundred dinars, I will give him some good
advice.” The king stopped, and said: “Abdal, what is this good advice for a
hundred dinars?” “Sir,” answered the abdal, “order the sum to be given to
me, and I will tell it you immediately.” The king did so, expecting to hear
something extraordinary. The dervish said to him: “My advice is this:
Never begin anything until you have reflected what will be the end of it.” At
this the nobles and everyone else present laughed, saying that the abdal had
been wise to ask for his money in advance. But the king said: “You have no
reason to laugh at the good advice this abdal has given me. No one is
unaware of the fact that we should think well before doing anything. But we
are daily guilty of not remembering, and the consequences are evil. I very
much value this dervish’s advice. ”
The king decided to bear the advice always in his mind, and commanded it
to be written in gold on the walls and even engraved on his silver plate.
Not long afterward a plotter desired to kill the king. He bribed the royal
surgeon with a promise of the prime ministership if he thrust a poisoned
lancet into the king’s arm. When the time came to let some of the king’s
blood, a silver basin was placed to catch the blood. Suddenly the surgeon
became aware of the words engraved upon it: “Never begin anything until
you have reflected what will be the end of it.” It was only then that he
realized that if the plotter became king he could have the surgeon killed
instantly, and would not need to fulfill his bargain.
The king, seeing that the surgeon was now trembling, asked him what was
wrong with hun. And so he confessed the truth, at that very moment.
The plotter was seized; and the king sent for all the people who had been
present when the abdal gave his advice, and said to them: “Do you still
laugh at the dervish?”
CARAVAN OF DREAMS, IDRIES SHAH, 1968
Interpretation
Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and
when they meet obstacles they improvise. But improvisation will only bring
you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking several
steps ahead and planning to the end.
Balboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it. Yet
his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten, for he
committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went part way,
leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of power would
have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance—the rivals who
would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that would hover once
they heard the word “gold.” Balboa should have kept his knowledge of the
Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only then would his wealth,
and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias arrived on the scene, a man
of power and prudence would have schemed to kill or imprison him, and to
take over the army he had brought for the conquest of Peru. But Balboa was
locked in the moment, always reacting emotionally, never thinking ahead.
What good is it to have the greatest dream in the world if others reap the
benefits and the glory? Never lose your head over a vague, open-ended
dream—plan to the end.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck surveyed the chessboard of
European power as it then stood. The main players were England, France,
and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely allied
German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation, made
sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and submissive.
Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far greater than
servant boy to Austria.
This is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a war
with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of
Schleswig-Holstein. He knew that these rumblings of Prussian
independence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in
the war, claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Holstein for their
benefit. In a few months, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded
that the newly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of
course were furious, but they compromised: First they agreed to give the
Prussians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world
began to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise.
Bismarck’s next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King
William of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing
so to go to war with Austria itself. King William’s wife, his son the crown
prince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently opposed
such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the conflict, and
Prussia’s superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally short Seven
Weeks War. The king and the Prussian generals then wanted to march on
Vienna, taking as much land from Austria as possible. But Bismarck
stopped them—now he presented himself as on the side of peace. The result
was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria that granted Prussia
and the other German states total autonomy. Bismarck could now position
Prussia as the dominant power in Germany and the head of a newly formed
North German Confederation.
The French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the
Hun, and to fear that he had designs on all of Europe. Once he had started
on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And,
indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he
appeared to give his permission to France’s annexation of Belgium, then at
the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a cat-and-mouse game, he
infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon III, and stirred up his own king
against the French. To no one’s surprise, war broke out in 1870. The newly
formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war on France, and
once again the Prussian military machine and its allies destroyed the enemy
army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck opposed taking any French
land, the generals convinced him that Alsace-Lorraine would become part
of the federation.
Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led by
Bismarck, the “Iron Chancellor.” And in fact a year later Bismarck founded
the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly crowned emperor
and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something strange happened:
Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other European powers
grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he severely limited
Germany’s colonial acquisitions. He did not want more land for Germany,
but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to maintain peace in
Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody assumed he had changed,
mellowing with the years. They had failed to understand: This was the final
move of his original plan.
He who asks fortune-tellers the future unwittingly forfeits an inner
intimation of coming events that is a thousand times more exact than
anything they may say.
WALTER BENJAMIN, 1892-1940
Interpretation
There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the
attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve victory
they only hunger for more. To stop—to aim for a goal and then keep to it—
seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the
maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs creates
a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to plan for
the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods on Mount
Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all things.
From the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal: to
form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the war
with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nationalism
and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain Prussian
independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian territory.) And he
fomented the war with France to unite the German kingdoms against a
common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a united Germany.
Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go to
his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the reins
tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people
demanded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those
around him to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned.
Experience shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs to be 
undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute
them.
Cardinal Richelieu, 1585-1642
KEYS TO POWER
According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought to
have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come, right
down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as victims
of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see beyond
immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were able to look
beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to defy fate, to
approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future. The
comparison is still valid—those among us who think further ahead and
patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power.
Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with this
kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and pleasures
translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the natural
human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to train
oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond one’s
immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of the
future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually deluded:
What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want
the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations rather
than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the way to the end,
but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and deluding
themselves by the strength of their desire.
In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their
expedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the
sixteen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an
invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would
fight all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that all
of Athens’s enemies would band together against them, or that war would
break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin. The Sicilian
expedition was a complete disaster, leading to the destruction of one of the
greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into this disaster
by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of glory, not the
dangers that loomed in the distance.
Cardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided himself
on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, analyzed this
phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded against the French
monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his court had suddenly
left Paris and established themselves in a palace outside the capital. The
presence of the king so close to the heart of the revolution had been a
tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they breathed a sigh of
relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since the court’s absence
from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver. “The most ordinary cause
of people’s mistakes,” Cardinal de Retz later wrote, “is their being too much
frightened at the present danger, and not enough so at that which is remote.”
The dangers that are remote, that loom in the distance—if we can see
them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans we
would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger only
to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but what you
do not do—the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from before they
get you into troub
