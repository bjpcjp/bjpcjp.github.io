LAW 16
USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR
JUDGMENT
Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and
heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in
a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about,
even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through
scarcity.
TRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Sir Guillaume de Balaun was a troubadour who roamed the South of France
in the Middle Ages, going from castle to castle, reciting poetry, and playing
the perfect knight. At the castle of Javiac he met and fell in love with the
beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma de Javiac. He sang her his
songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her, and little by little she in
turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Barjac, who
traveled with him and who was also received at the castle. And Pierre too
fell in love with a lady in Javiac, the gracious but temperamental Viernetta.
THE CAMEL AND THE FLOATING STICKS
The first man who saw a camel fled;
The second ventured within distance;
The third dared slip a halter round its head. 
Familiarity in this existence makes all things tame, for what may seem 
Terrible or bizarre, when once our eyes have had time to acclimatize, 
Becomes quite commonplace. 
Since I’m on this theme, 
I’ve heard of sentinels posted by the shore
Who, spotting something far-away afloat, 
Couldn’t resist the shout: 
“A sail! A sail! 
A mighty man-of-war!” 
Five minutes later it’s a packet boat, 
And then a skiff, and then a bale, 
And finally some sticks bobbing about. 
I know of plenty such 
To whom this story applies— 
People whom distance magnifies 
Who, close to, don’t amount to much.
 
SELECTED FABLES, JEAN DE LA FONTAINE, 1621-1695
 
Then one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady
dismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the
breach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave
the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his
magic, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre felt that his love had
increased tenfold—that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the love
that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer the disagreement, he
told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and
rapprochement.
As a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the
joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend’s talk, he too wanted know
the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore feigned great anger
with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love letters, and abruptly left the
castle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the
young lady wild.
Guillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had happened,
but he turned the messengers away. He thought all this would make her
angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead,
however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made Guillelma love him
all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and love
notes of her own. This was almost unheard of—a lady never pursued her
troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Guillelma’s forwardness made
him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer sure of
his plan, he was no longer sure of his lady.
Finally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma
gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder—
perhaps she was angry? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the
better if she was. He would wait no more—it was time to reconcile. So he
put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest caparison, chose a
magnificent helmet, and rode off to Javiac.
On hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see him,
knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgiveness for
whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and despair—
his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never been angry,
she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience the joy of
reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate to taste
that joy, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with harsh
words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to see him
again.
The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He rode
back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive him, and ordered her servants
to chase him away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guillaume fled.
Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had made a terrible
mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he experienced the
absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He wrote one of
his most beautiful poems, “My song ascends for mercy praying.” And he
sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done, and begging
forgiveness.
After a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his beautiful
songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and falconry, found
herself yearning to have him back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered
him to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it
to her along with a poem describing his miseries.
He did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to taste the
ultimate sensation—a reconciliation even surpassing that of his friend
Pierre.
FIVE VIRTUES OF THE COCK
While serving under the Duke Ai of Lu, T‘ien Jao, resenting his obscure
position, said to his master, “I am going to wander far away like a snow
goose. ” “What do you mean by that?” inquired the Duke. “Do you see the
cock?” said T’ien Jao in reply. “Its crest is a symbol of civility; its powerful
talons suggest strength; its daring to fight any enemy denotes courage; its
instinct to invite others whenever food is obtained shows benevolence; and,
last but not least, its punctuality in keeping the time through the night gives
us an example of veracity. In spite. however, of these five virtues, the cock is
daily killed to fill a dish on your table. Why? The reason is that it is found
within our reach. On the other hand, the snow goose traverses in one flight
a thousand li. Resting in your garden, it preys on your fishes and turtles and
pecks your millet. Though devoid of any of the cock’s five virtues, yet you
prize this bird for the sake of its scarcity. This being so, I shall fly far like a
snow goose.”
ANCIENT CHINESE PARABLES, YU HSIU SEN, ED., 1974
Interpretation
Trying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun
inadvertently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At
the start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the
other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once your
lover’s emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized,
absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites
even more: The other person assumes he or she is at fault. While you are
away, the lover’s imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination
cannot help but make love grow stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma
pursued Guillaume, the less he loved her—she had become too present, too
accessible, leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his
feelings were suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, he
was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan.
What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our
respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence,
makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting their
knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and arduous
quest—all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had
Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to
send him away, creating an absence of her own.
Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, 
as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire.
La Rochefoucauld, 1613-1680
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the
eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestern Iran)
revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to
establish a new government. Determined to avoid any form of despotism,
they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a
monarchy. Without a leader, however, the country soon fell into chaos, and
fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village.
In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a
name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes.
He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the area
was brought to him, and his power increased. Throughout the land, the law
had fallen into disrepute—the judges were corrupt, and no one entrusted
their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead. When news
spread of Deioces’ wisdom, incorruptibility, and unshakable impartiality,
Medean villages far and wide turned to him to settle all manner of cases.
Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land.
At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had enough.
He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no more suits,
settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village and village.
Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with other
people’s problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired. The
country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden withdrawal of a
powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt for the law
was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages to decide
how to get out of their predicament. “We cannot continue to live in this
country under these conditions,” said one tribal leader. “Let us appoint one
of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly government, rather
than losing our homes altogether in the present chaos.”
And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian
despotism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the
man they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He
was hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages’
in-fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded—without him
the country had descended into a state of lawlessness. Deioces finally
agreed.
Yet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be
constructed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital
city was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and
Deioces settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was
surrounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people.
Deioces then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence
was forbidden. Communication with the king was only possible through
messengers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a
week, and then only by permission.
Deioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire, and
established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire, under
his great-great-grandson Cyrus. During Deioces’ reign, the people’s respect
for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was not a mere mortal,
they believed, but the son of a god.
Interpretation
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the
country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job.
In a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge and
arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man of
impeccable fairness.
At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the truth
of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he had
become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had earlier
enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way to
regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw completely,
and let the Medes taste what life was like without him. As he expected, they
came begging for him to rule.
Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its
ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for him, none could
see him except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote,
“There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw him, the legend
would grow that he was a being of a different order from mere men.”
A man said to a Dervish: “Why do I not see you more often?” The Dervish 
replied, “Because the words ‘Why have you not been to see me?’ are 
sweeter to my ear than the words ‘Why have you come again?”’
Mulla jami, quoted in ldries Shah’s Caravan of Dreams, 1968
KEYS TO POWER
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong
presence will draw power and attention to you—you shine more brightly
than those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much
presence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard you
try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why, people respect you
less and less. At the right moment you must learn to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide-and-seek.
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover’s absence
stimulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But
this aura fades when you know too much—when your imagination no
longer has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else,
a person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth-
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at
withdrawal from one’s lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote,
“but often of indigestion.”
The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too
late—you are swallowed and digested. To prevent this you need to starve
the other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatening them
with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of
presence and absence.
Once you die, everything about you will seem different. You will be
surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their
criticisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret
and guilt. They are missing a presence that will never return. But you do not
have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you
create a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as
if you had come back from the dead—an air of resurrection will cling to
you, and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made
himself king.
Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he said,
“If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.” Today, in
a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the game of
withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to withdraw
anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone who is able
to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon have
created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear.
Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates its
truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics. By
withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In
seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip
more than just a beautiful flower—they wanted it to be a kind of status
symbol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they
sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth
more than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer
Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare
as possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up
whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he
sold became more than just paintings—they were fetish objects, their value
increased by their rarity. “You can get all the pictures you want at fifty
thousand dollars apiece—that’s easy,” he once said. “But to get pictures at a
quarter of a million apiece—that wants doing!”
Image: 
The Sun. It can only be 
appreciated by its absence. 
The longer the days of rain, the 
more the sun is craved. But too many 
hot days and the sun overwhelms. 
Learn to keep yourself obscure and 
make people demand your return.
Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offering
the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value.
There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as
rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes to
their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done
right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power.
The greatest ruler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of Spain,
Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point included much
of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power, in 1557, he
retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated by his
sudden withdrawal; people who had hated and feared him suddenly called
him great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times, the film
actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she retired, in
1941. For some her absence came too soon—she was in her mid-thirties—
but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than waiting for
her audience to grow tired of her.
Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less
accessible and you increase the value of your presence.
Authority: 
Use absence to create 
respect and esteem. If presence 
diminishes fame, absence augments it. 
A man who when absent is regarded as a 
lion becomes when present something com- 
mon and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster 
if we become too familiar with them, for the 
outer shell of the mind is more readily seen 
than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand-
ing genius makes use of retirement so that 
men may honor him and so that the 
yearning aroused by his absence 
may cause him to be esteemed. 
(Baltasar Gracián, 
1601-1658)
REVERSAL
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;
leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply
forgotten. When you are first entering onto the world’s stage, create an
image that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that
status is attained, absence is dangerous—instead of fanning the flames, it
will extinguish them.
In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you have
surrounded the other with your image, been seen by him or her everywhere.
Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that when you do
choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you, will always be
seeing you in his or her mind’s eye.
Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but omnipresent.
Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its absence.
