LAW 26
KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN
JUDGMENT
You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never
soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by
using others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement.
PART I: CONCEAL YOUR MISTAKES—HAVE A
SCAPEGOAT AROUND TO TAKE THE BLAME
Our good name and reputation depend more on what we conceal than on
what we reveal. Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are truly clever
manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is blamed. A
convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for such moments.
CHELM JUSTICE
A great calamity befell the town of Chelm one day. The town cobbler
murdered one of his customers. So he was brought before the judge, who
sentenced him to die by hanging. When the verdict was read a townsman
arose and cried out, “If your Honor pleases—you have sentenced to death
the town cobbler! He’s the only one we’ve got. lf you hang him who will
mend our shoes?” “Who? Who?” cried all the people of Chelm with one
voice.
The judge nodded in agreement and reconsidered his verdict. “Good people
of Chelm,”he said, “what you say is true. Since we have only one cobbler it
would he a great wrong against the community to let him die. As there are
two roofers in the town let one of them be hanged instead.”

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Near the end of the second century A.D., as China’s mighty Han Empire
slowly collapsed, the great general and imperial minister Ts‘ao Ts’ao
emerged as the most powerful man in the country. Seeking to extend his
power base and to rid himself of the last of his rivals, Ts‘ao Ts’ao began a
campaign to take control of the strategically vital Central Plain. During the
siege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the timing for supplies of grain
to arrive from the capital. As he waited for the shipment to come in, the
army ran low on food, and Ts‘ao Ts’ao was forced to order the chief of
commissariat to reduce its rations.
Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of informers.
His spies soon reported that the men were complaining, grumbling that he
was living well while they themselves had barely enough to eat. Perhaps
Ts‘ao Ts’ao was keeping the food for himself, they murmured. If the
grumbling spread, Ts‘ao Ts’ao could have a mutiny on his hands. He
summoned the chief of commissariat to his tent.
“I want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not refuse,” Ts‘ao
Ts’ao told the chief. “What is it?” the chief replied. “I want the loan of your
head to show to the troops,” said Ts‘ao Ts’ao. “But I’ve done nothing
wrong!” cried the chief. “I know,” said Ts‘ao Ts’ao with a sigh, “but if I do
not put you to death, there will be a mutiny. Do not grieve—after you’re
gone, I’ll look after your family.” Put this way, the request left the chief no
choice, so he resigned himself to his fate and was beheaded that very day.
Seeing his head on public display, the soldiers stopped grumbling. Some
saw through Ts‘ao Ts’ao’s gesture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated
by his violence. And most accepted his version of who was to blame,
preferring to believe in his wisdom and fairness than in his incompetence
and cruelty.
Interpretation
Ts‘ao Ts’ao came to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In the struggle
for supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had emerged from all
sides. The battle for the Central Plain had proven more difficult than he
imagined, and money and provisions were a constant concern. No wonder
that under such stress, he had forgotten to order supplies in time.
Once it became clear that the delay was a critical mistake, and that the
army was seething with mutiny, Ts‘ao Ts’ao had two options: apology and
excuses, or a scapegoat. Understanding the workings of power and the
importance of appearances as he did, Ts‘ao Ts’ao did not hesitate for a
moment: He shopped around for the most convenient head and had it served
up immediately.
Occasional mistakes are inevitable—the world is just too unpredictable.
People of power, however, are undone not by the mistakes they make, but
by the way they deal with them. Like surgeons, they must cut away the
tumor with speed and finality. Excuses and apologies are much too blunt
tools for this delicate operation; the powerful avoid them. By apologizing
you open up all sorts of doubts about your competence, your intentions, any
other mistakes you may not have confessed. Excuses satisfy no one and
apologies make everyone uncomfortable. The mistake does not vanish with
an apology; it deepens and festers. Better to cut it off instantly, distract
attention from yourself, and focus attention on a convenient scapegoat
before people have time to ponder your responsibility or your possible
incompetence.
I would rather betray the whole world than let the world betray me.
General Ts‘ao Ts’ao, c. A.D. 155-220
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts of
Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year 1500 he
managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region had for years been
ruled by a series of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for
themselves. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into
lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families. To
establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region—
Remirro de Orco, “a cruel and vigorous man,” according to Niccolõ
Machiavelli. Cesare gave de Orco absolute powers.
With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice in
Romagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his
zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local
population resented and even hated him. In December of 1502, Cesare took
decisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de
Orco’s cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenant’s brutal
nature. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned de Orco in the town of
Cesena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a
strange spectacle in the middle of the piazza: de Orco’s headless body,
dressed in a lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a
pike, the bloody knife and executioner’s block laid out beside the head. As
Machiavelli concluded his comments on the affair, “The ferocity of this
scene left the people at once stunned and satisfied.”
Interpretation
Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning
several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this
Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.
Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only brutal
justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several
years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of such
unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare himself, then, could not
be seen as the agent of this justice—the people’s hatred would cause too
many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who could do
the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done he would
have to display de Orco’s head on a pike. The scapegoat in this case had
been planned from the beginning.
With Ts‘ao Ts’ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the
Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare’s arsenal that let him get
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at
some point, either leaving him dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even
making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not only are you free of
involvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up.
The Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless 
beings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as plague, 
drought, or famine, befell the city ... [these scapegoats] were led about ... 
and then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city.
The Golden Bough, Sir James George Frazer, 1854-1941
KEYS TO POWER
The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these
sacrifices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside figure—object,
animal, or man—which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to
take a live goat (hence the term “scapegoat”) upon whose head the priest
would lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel.
Having thus had those sins transferred to it, the beast would be led away
and abandoned in the wilderness. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the
scapegoat was human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since
famine and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in
punishment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine
and plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of
guilt by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to
satisfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.
It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake or
crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a
convenient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked
everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside himself and his own sin
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This
profound need to exteriorize one’s guilt, to project it on another person or
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to harness.
Sacrifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a
well-spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesare’s symbolic and
ritualistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused
guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it
comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily
accept the scapegoat’s guilt.
The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the past,
but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically; since
power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never to
make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modern
leader will take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others to
blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung’s Cultural Revolution
failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese people;
instead, like Ts‘ao Ts’ao before him, he offered up scapegoats, including his
own personal secretary and high-ranking member of the Party, Ch’en Po-ta.
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being
the nice guy would have spelled political disaster—yet he could not be seen
as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary, Louis
Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals, the
manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneuvers. And
whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting
Roosevelt’s carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the
scapegoat, and never complained.
Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a warning
to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France’s Cardinal Richelieu
from power, a plot that became known as “The Day of the Dupes.” It almost
succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of government, including
the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances, Richelieu
survived.
One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of the
seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen
mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac’s brother, a
marshal in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu,
however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the
army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trumped-up
charges and had him executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real
perpetrator, who had thought himself protected, and warned any future
conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to
protect his own power.
In fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a
sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and
their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much—may be seen, in
other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a
martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed
by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too weak
and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your own
device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoat—one who
will elicit less sympathy in the long run.
In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a close
associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.” Most
kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out,
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention.
But this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a
threat to the king’s reputation. The public would readily believe in the
scapegoat’s guilt—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would
rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man
who by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps
becoming arrogant and even disdainful of him. Choosing a close associate
as a scapegoat has the same value as the “fall of the favorite.” You may lose
a friend or aide, but in the long-term scheme of things, it is more important
to hide your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will
probably turn against you. Besides, you can always find a new favorite to
take his place.
Image: The Innocent Goat. On 
the Day of Atonement, the high 
priest brings the goat into the 
temple, places his hands on its 
head, and confesses the peo- 
ple’s sins, transferring guilt to 
the guiltless beast, which is 
then led to the wilderness and 
abandoned, the people’s sins 
and blame vanishing with him.
 
 
 
 
Authority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being incapable of
concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise conceal the blunders
they have made, while fools make them public. Reputation depends more
on what is hidden than on what is seen. If you can’t be good, be careful.
(Baltasar Gracián, 1601-1658)
PART II: MAKE USE OF THE CAT’S-PAW
In the fable, the Monkey grabs the paw of his friend, the Cat, and uses it to
fish chestnuts out of the fire, thus getting the nuts he craves, without hurting
himself.
If there is something unpleasant or unpopular that needs to be done, it is
far too risky for you to do the work yourself. You need a cat‘s-paw-someone
who does the dirty, dangerous work for you. The cat’s-paw grabs what you
need, hurts whom you need hurt, and keeps people from noticing that you
are the one responsible. Let someone else be the executioner, or the bearer
of bad news, while you bring only joy and glad tidings.
THE MONKEY AND THE CAT
A monkey and cat, in roguery and fun 
Sworn brothers twain, both owned a common master, 
Whatever mischief in the house was done 
By Pug and Tom was contrived each disaster....
One winter’s day was seen this hopeful pair 
Close to the kitchen fire, as usual, posted. 
Amongst the red-hot coals the cook with care 
Had plac’d some nice plump chestnuts to be roasted,
From whence in smoke a pungent odor rose,
Whose oily fragrance struck the monkey’s nose.
“Tom!” says sly Pug, “pray could not you and I 
Share this dessert the cook is pleased to cater?
Had I such claws as yours, I’d quickly try: 
Lend me a hand—’twill be a coup-de-maître.” 
So said, he seized his colleague’s ready paw, 
Pulled out the fruit, and crammed it in his jaw.
Now came the shining Mistress of the fane. 
And off in haste the two marauders scampered.
Tom for his share of the plunder had the pain.
Whilst Pug his palate with the dainties pampered.
FABLES, JEAN OF LA FONTAINE, 1621-1695
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In 59 B.C., the future queen Cleopatra of Egypt, then ten years old,
witnessed the overthrow and banishment of her father, Ptolemy XII, at the
hand of his elder daughters—her own sisters. One of the daughters,
Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to ensure that she
would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other sisters and murdered
her own husband. This may have been necessary as a practical step to
secure her rule. But that a member of the royal family, a queen no less,
would so overtly exact such violence on her own family horrified her
subjects and stirred up powerful opposition. Four years later this opposition
was able to return Ptolemy to power, and he promptly had Berenice and the
other elder sisters beheaded.
In 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As
was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the
time), married the elder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple
took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children felt
satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A
struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, each trying to push the
other to the side.
In 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopatra’s
ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country, leaving
himself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She wanted to rule alone
and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she felt none of her other
siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were alive, she could not realize
her dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no one
would serve a queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even Ptolemy
XIII had not dared murder Cleopatra, although he knew she would plot
against him from abroad.
Within a year after Cleopatra’s banishment, the Roman dictator Julius
Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony.
Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled
hundreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had
herself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet, which was
gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra
immediately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of
spectacle and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine
charms. Caesar soon succumbed and restored Cleopatra to the throne.
Cleopatra’s siblings seethed—she had outmaneuvered them. Ptolemy
XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his palace in
Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack
Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the
family under house arrest. But Cleopatra’s younger sister Arsinoe escaped
from the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian
troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her
chance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under
the agreement that he would broker a truce. Of course she knew he would
do the opposite—that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian
army. But this was to Cleopatra’s benefit, for it would divide the royal
family. Better still, it would give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her
siblings in battle.
Reinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels. In
the Egyptians’ retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Ni
