LAW 47
DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN
VICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP
JUDGMENT
The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of
victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had
aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do
not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and
careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 559 B.C., a young man named Cyrus gathered an immense army from
the scattered tribes of Persia and marched against his grandfather Astyages,
king of the Medes. He defeated Astyages with ease, had himself crowned
king of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empire. Victory
followed victory in quick succession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of
Lydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdoms; he
marched on Babylon and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the Great,
King of the World.
After capturing the riches of Babylon, Cyrus set his sights on the east, on
the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the Caspian Sea.
A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the
riches of Babylon, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing
himself superhuman and incapable of defeat. The Massagetai would fall
easily to his vast armies, making his empire immense.
In 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes, gateway to
the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he
received a message from Queen Tomyris: “King of the Medes,” she told
him, “I advise you to abandon this enterprise, for you cannot know if in the
end it will do you any good. Rule your own people, and try to bear the sight
of me ruling mine. But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last thing
you wish for is to live in peace.” Tomyris, confident of her army’s strength
and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw the
troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely and
fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desire.
Cyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided to
play a trick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed
the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an
elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left his
weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the river. A
large Massagetai detachment soon attacked the camp and killed all of the
Persian soldiers in a fierce battle. Then, overwhelmed by the fabulous feast
that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts’ content. Later,
inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the camp that
night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the rest. Among
the prisoners was their general, a youth named Spargapises, son of Queen
Tomyris.
When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to
Cyrus, chiding him for using tricks to defeat her army. “Now listen to me,”
she wrote, “and I will advise you for your own good: Give me back my son
and leave my country with your forces intact, and be content with your
triumph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you refuse, I swear by the sun
our master to give you more blood than you can drink, for all your
gluttony.” Cyrus scoffed at her: He would not release her son. He would
crush these barbarians.
THE VAINGLORIOUS COCKEREL
Two cockerels fought on a dungheap. One cockerel was the stronger: he
vanquished the other and drove him from the dungheap. All the hens
gathered around the cockerel, and began to laud him. The cockerel wanted
his strength and glory to be known in the next yard. He flew on top of the
barn, flapped his wings, and crowed in a load voice: “Look at me, all of
you. I am a victorious cockerel. No other cockerel in the world has such
strength as I. ” The cockerel had not finished, when an eagle killed him,
seized him in his claws, and carried him to his nest.
 
FABLES, LEO TOLSTOY, 1828-1910
The queen’s son, seeing he would not be released, could not stand the
humiliation, and so he killed himself. The news of her son’s death
overwhelmed Tomyris. She gathered all the forces that she could muster in
her kingdom, and whipping them into a vengeful frenzy, engaged Cyrus’s
troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the Massagetai prevailed. In
their anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself.
After the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield for
Cyrus’s corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved it into a
wineskin full of human blood, crying out, “Though I have conquered you
and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See now
—I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood.” After Cyrus’s death, the
Persian Empire quickly unraveled. One act of arrogance undid all of
Cyrus’s good work.
Interpretation
There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more
dangerous.
Cyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A
hundred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally
destroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand. The
Assyrians had suffered this fate because they had pushed too far, destroying
one city-state after another until they lost sight of the purposes of their
victories, and also of the costs. They overextended themselves and made
many enemies who were finally able to band together and destroy them.
Cyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings of
oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His many
victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of consolidating
his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recognizing each
situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the same result
as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew: ruthless force
and cunning.
Understand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason. To let
a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide your moves
will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. When you
gain victory, understand the part played by the particular circumstances of a
situation, and never simply repeat the same actions again and again. History
is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and the corpses of leaders
who could not learn to stop and consolidate their gains.
THE SEQUENCE OF CROSS-EXAMINATION
In all your cross-examinations..., most important of all, let me repeat the
injunction to be ever on the alert for a good place to stop. Nothing can be
more important than to close your examination with a triumph. So many
lawyers succeed in catching a witness in a serious contradiction; but, not
satisfied with this, go on asking questions, and taper off their examination
until the effect upon the jury of their former advantage is lost altogether.
THE ART OF CROSS-EXAMINATION, FRANCIS L. WELLMAN, 1913
THE OVERREACHING GENERAL
We read of many instances of this kind; for the general who by his valor has
conquered a state for his master, and won great glory for himself by his
victory over the enemy, and has loaded his soldiers with rich booty,
acquires necessarily with his own soldiers, as well as with those of the
enemy and with the subjects of the prince, so high a reputation, that his very
victory may become distasteful, and a cause for apprehension to his prince.
For as the nature of men is ambitious as well as suspicious, and puts no
limits to one’s good fortune, it is not impossible that the suspicion that may
suddenly be aroused in the mind of the prince by the victory of the general
may have been aggravated by some haughty expressions or insolent acts on
his part; so that the prince will naturally be made to think of securing
himself against the ambition of his general.
And to do this, the means that suggest themselves to him are either to have
the general killed, or to deprive him of that reputation which he has
acquired with the prince’s army and the people, by using every means to
prove that the general’s victory was not due to his skill and courage, but to
chance and the cowardice of the enemy, or to the sagacity of the other
captains who were with him in that action.
 
NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI, 1469-1527
 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
No single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious
position than the king’s mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base
to fall back on in times of trouble; she was surrounded by packs of envious
courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from grace; and finally, since the
source of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal
mistresses that fall was inevitable and unpleasant.
King Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the early
days of his reign, each woman’s good fortune rarely lasting more than a few
years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a middle-
class child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been told by a fortune-teller
that she would someday be the king’s favorite. This seemed an absurd
dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aristocracy.
Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king, and doing
so became her obsession. She applied herself to the talents the king’s
favorite had to have—music, dancing, acting, horseback riding—and she
excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a man of the
lower nobility, which gave her an entrée to the best salons in Paris. Word
quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence.
Jeanne Poisson became close friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu, and
other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal she had set
herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her husband had a chateau
in a forest where the king would often go hunting, and she began to spend a
lot of time there. Studying his movements like a hawk, she would make
sure he would “happen” to come upon her while she was out walking in her
most alluring dress, or riding in her splendid coach. The king began to take
note of her, making her gifts of the game he caught in the hunt.
In 1744 Louis’s current mistress, the Duchesse de Chateauroux, died.
Jeanne went on the offensive. She placed herself everywhere he would be:
at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their paths would cross,
and wherever she could display her many talents: dancing, singing, riding,
coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a ceremony at
Versailles in September of 1745, this twenty-four-year-old daughter of a
middle-class banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king’s
mistress. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could
enter at any time via a hidden stairway and back door. And because some of
the courtiers were angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he
made her a marquise. From now on she would be known as Madame de
Pompadour.
The king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would
oppress out of proportion. Madame de Pompadour knew that keeping him
under her spell meant keeping him amused. To that end she put on constant
theatrical productions at Versailles, in which she starred. She organized
elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it would take to
keep him diverted outside the bedroom. She became a patroness of the arts,
and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of France. Her enemies at the
court only grew in number with each new success, but Madame de
Pompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a king’s mistress: with
extreme politeness. Snobs who resented her for her low birth she won over
with charm and grace. Most unusual of all, she befriended the queen, and
insisted that Louis XV pay more attention to his wife, and treat her more
kindly. Even the royal family begrudgingly gave her their support. To crown
her glory, the king made her a duchess. Her sway was felt even in politics:
Indeed she became the untitled minister of foreign affairs.
In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power,
she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by the
responsibilities of her position, she found it increasingly difficult to meet
the king’s demands in bed. This was usually the point at which the mistress
would meet her end, struggling to maintain her position as her beauty faded.
But Madame de Pompadour had a strategy: She encouraged the king to set
up a kind of brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, on the grounds of Versailles. There the
middle-aged king could have liaisons with the most beautiful young girls in
the realm.
 
Madame de Pompadour knew that her charm and her political acumen
had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to fear from a
sixteen-year-old who had none of her power and presence? What did it
matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as she remained the
most powerful woman in France? To secure that position she became still
closer friends with the queen, with whom she started attending church.
Although her enemies at the court conspired to have her toppled from her
official position as king’s mistress, the king kept her on, for he needed her
calming effect. It was only when her part in the disastrous Seven Years’
War drew much criticism on her that she slowly withdrew from public
affairs.
Madame de Pompadour’s health had always been delicate, and she died
at the age of forty-three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had lasted an
unprecedented twenty years. “She was regretted by all,” wrote the Duc de
Croy, “for she was kindly and helpful to everyone who approached her.”
Interpretation
Aware of the temporariness of her power, the king’s mistress would often go
into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumulate
as much money as possible to protect her after her inevitable fall. And to
extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her enemies
in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from her a
greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame de
Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never pressed
her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her powerful
position as the king’s mistress, she tried to win their support. She never
revealed the slightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no longer
perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the thought of
someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strategy—she
encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the younger and
prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they could not
compare to her in charm and sophistication and would soon bore the
monarch.
A man who was famous as a tree climber was guiding someone in climbing
a tall tree. He ordered the man to cut the top branches, and, during this
time, when the man seemed to be in great danger, the expert said nothing.
Only when the man was coming down and had reached the height of the
eaves did the expert call out, “Be careful! Watch your step coming down!” I
asked him, “Why did you say that? At that height he could jump the rest of
the way if he chose.” “That’s the point, ”said the expert. “As long as the
man was up at a dizzy height and the branches were threatening to break,
he himself was so afraid I said nothing. Mistakes are always made when
people get to the easy places.” This man belonged to the lowest class, but
his words were in perfect accord with the precepts of the sages. In football
too, they say that after you have kicked out of a difficult place and you think
the next one will be easier you are sure to miss the ball.
 
ESSAYS IN IDLENESS, KENKO, JAPAN, FOURTEENTH CENTURY
 
Success plays strange tricks on the mind. It makes you feel invulnerable,
while also making you more hostile and emotional when people challenge
your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumstance. You come to
believe your character is more responsible for your success than your
strategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to realize
that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to rely on
cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base,
recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and
remaining vigilant against changes in your good fortune. It is the moment of
victory when you need to play the courtier’s game and pay more attention
than ever to the laws of power.
The greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory.
Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821
KEYS TO POWER
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game
are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping people
off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is controlling
what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to control
what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pattern that
you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the same
direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that is
best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you
emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ultimately
undo the victory you have gained.
The lesson is simple: The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns,
change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise. Rather than
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look
where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to
a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady
themselves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened,
examine the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in
riding school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control
the horse.
Luck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is inevitable,
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may
think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches
valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think
your brilliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, and
when it does you will be completely unprepared.
According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to have
good luck: He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck for real
—his father’s death—he was unprepared for it, and the many enemies he
had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals your
success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of fortune
will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is less
likely to ruin you when it happens.
People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even
when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often
pressure them to go past their mark and into dangerous waters. You have to
have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply preaching moderation
will make you look weak and small-minded; seeming to fail to follow up on
a victory can lessen your power.
When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of naval
campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs enflamed
the Athenians’ desire for more. They dreamed of conquering Egypt,
overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles reined in
these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On the other
hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew
