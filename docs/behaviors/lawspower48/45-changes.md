LAW 45
PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM
TOO MUCH AT ONCE
JUDGMENT
Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-
to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is
traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or
an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old
way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle
improvement on the past.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Sometime in the early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England decided to
divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she had failed to bear him a
son, and because he had fallen in love with the young and comely Anne
Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed the divorce, and threatened the
king with excommunication. The king’s most powerful minister, Cardinal
Wolsey, also saw no need for divorce—and his halfhearted support of the
king cost him his position and soon his life.
One man in Henry’s cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, not only supported him
in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete break
with the past. He convinced the king that by severing ties with Rome and
making himself the head of a newly formed English church, he could
divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By 1531 Henry saw this as the only
solution. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated
this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor.
By 1534 Cromwell had been named the king’s secretary, and as the
power behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in England.
But for him the break with Rome went beyond the satisfaction of the king’s
carnal desires: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England, with the
power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wealth in the hands of
the king and the government. In that same year he initiated a complete
survey of the churches and monasteries of England. And as it turned out,
the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated over the
centuries were far more than he had imagined; his spies and agents came
back with astonishing figures.
To justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about the corruption
in the English monasteries, their abuse of power, their exploitation of the
people they supposedly served. Having won Parliament’s support for
breaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put
them out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose
Protestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing those
who stuck to Catholicism, and who now were called heretics. Virtually
overnight, England was converted to a new official religion.
A terror fell on the country. Some people had suffered under the Catholic
Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful, but most
Britons had strong ties to Catholicism and to its comforting rituals. They
watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the Madonna
and saints were broken in pieces, stained-glass windows were smashed, and
the churches’ treasures were confiscated. With monasteries that had
succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the streets. The
growing ranks of the beggar class were further swelled by former monks.
On top of all this, Cromwell levied high taxes to pay for his ecclesiastical
reforms.
WHERE CHRISTMAS CAME FROM
Celebrating the turn of the year is an ancient custom. The Romans
celebrated the Saturnalia, the festival of Saturn, god of the harvest, between
December 17 and 23. It was the most cheerful festival of the year. All work
and commerce stopped, and the streets were filled with crowds and a
carnival atmosphere. Slaves were temporarily freed, and the houses were
decorated with laurel branches. People visited one another, bringing gifts of
wax candles and little clay figurines.
Long before the birth of Christ, the Jews celebrated an eight-day Festival of
Lights [at the same season], and it is believed that the Germanic peoples
held a great festival not only at midsummer but also at the winter solstice,
when they celebrated the rebirth of the sun and honored the great fertility
gods Wotan and Freyja, Donar (Thor) and Freyr. Even after the Emperor
Constantine (A.D. 306-337) declared Christianity to be Rome’s official
imperial religion, the evocation of light and fertility as an important
component of pre-Christian midwinter celebrations could nor be entirely
suppressed. In the year 274 the Roman Emperor Aurelian (A.D. 214-275)
had established an official cult of the sun-god Mithras, declaring his
birthday, December 25, a national holiday. The cult of Mithras, the Aryan
god of light, had spread from Persia through Asia Minor to Greece, Rome,
and as far as the Germanic lands and Britain. Numerous ruins of his
shrines still testify to the high regard in which this god was held, especially
by the Roman legions, as a bringer of fertility, peace, and victory. So it was
a clever move when, in the year A.D. 354, the Christian church under Pope
Liberius (352-366) co-opted the birthday of Mithras and declared
December 25 to be the birthday of Jesus Christ.
NEUE ZÜRCHER ZEITUNG, ANNE-SUSANNE RISCHKE,
DECEMBER 25, 1983
In 1535 powerful revolts in the North of England threatened to topple
Henry from his throne. By the following year he had suppressed the
rebellions, but he had also begun to see the costs of Cromwell’s reforms.
The king himself had never wanted to go this far—he had only wanted a
divorce. It was now Cromwell’s turn to watch uneasily as the king began
slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other rituals
that Cromwell had outlawed.
Sensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain Henry’s
favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a new wife.
Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, had died a few years before, and he had
been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found him one:
Anne of Cleves, a German princess and, most important to Cromwell, a
Protestant. On Cromwell’s commission, the painter Holbein produced a
flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, and agreed to
marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor.
Unfortunately, however, Holbein’s painting was highly idealized, and
when the king finally met the princess she did not please him in the least.
His anger against Cromwell—first for the ill-conceived reforms, now for
saddling him with an unattractive and Protestant wife—could no longer be
contained. In June of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a
Protestant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later,
before a large and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his
head.
Interpretation
Thomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and
wealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England.
And he would do this in a mercilessly short time. He knew his speedy
reforms would cause pain and resentment, but he thought these feelings
would fade in a few years. More important, by identifying himself with
change, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king
dependent on him. But there was a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard
ball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms
he did not envision and could not control.
The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for
any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may
consume him, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is
for the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity
and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to
make the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even
sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety
that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.
Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It is
powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud
your reason: Just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel. If
reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and find ways to
disguise the change and sweeten the poison.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
As a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung understood better than
any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in
China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experience,
and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success unless it
won over China’s immense peasant population. But who in the world was
more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese peasantry?
The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would never loosen
its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of Confucius
remained as alive in the 1920s as they had been in the sixth century B.C.,
when the philosopher was alive. Despite the oppressions of the current
system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of the past
for the great unknown of Communism?
The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate in
people’s eyes. One of Mao’s favorite books was the very popular medieval
Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a Chinese
Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a corrupt and evil
monarch. In China in Mao’s time, family ties dominated over any other
kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son remained firmly
in place; but The Water Margin preached a superior value—the fraternal ties
of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites people beyond
blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chinese people, who
love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then, Mao would present his
revolutionary army as an extension of the robber band in The Water Margin,
likening his struggle to the timeless conflict between the oppressed
peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past seem to envelop and
legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could feel comfortable with
and even support a group with such roots in the past.
Even once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as a
modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century strategist who figures
prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance of the Three
Kingdoms. Liang was more than a great general—he was a poet, a
philosopher, and a figure of stern moral rectitude. So Mao represented
himself as a poet-warrior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with
philosophy and preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero
from the great Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen.
Soon, everything in Mao’s speeches and writings had a reference to an
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great
Emperor Ch‘in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch’in
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the
building of the Great Wall, and given his name to China. Like Ch‘in, Mao
also had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against
an oppressive past. Ch’in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao’s strategy was to turn this
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch’in, justifying his rule in the eyes
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new
order that Mao himself was creating.
After the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power struggle
emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao’s main foe was Lin Piao,
once a close friend of his. To make clear to the masses the difference
between his philosophy and Lin’s, Mao once again exploited the past: He
cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher Lin in fact
would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the
past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient
philosophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of
Han-fei-tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the
need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give
himself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda
campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus
Legalism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older
generation. This grand context enveloped a rather banal power struggle, and
Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies.
Interpretation
No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese. In
the face of this enormous obstacle to reform, Mao’s strategy was simple:
Instead of struggling against the past, he turned it to his advantage,
associating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese
history. Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the
struggle between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, he cast
himself as Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike
adoration of the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function
without some kind of father figure to admire. And after he made a terrible
blunder with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the
country and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on,
radical change had to be cloaked in the comfortable clothes of the past.
The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before
seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your
advantage. When you destroy the familiar you create a void or vacuum;
people fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up
such fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past,
however remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence. This will
give your actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and cloak the
nature of the changes you are attempting.
It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, 
nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, 
than to initiate a new order of things.
Niccolò Machiavelli, 1469-1527
KEYS TO POWER
Human psychology contains many dualities, one of them being that even
while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is
for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also
irritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that
change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is
deeply disturbing to them.
No revolution has gone without a powerful later reaction against it, for in
the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human animal,
who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The
opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the
revolution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with
a certain emptiness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to
creep back in.
For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can only
survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the past,
he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet cannot last long unless
he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old ones,
and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier, and
less bloody, to play a kind of con game. Preach change as much as you like,
and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appearance of
older events and traditions.
Reigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mang
emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which the people
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch’in had ordered the writings of
Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts had
miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar’s house. These texts may
not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first
confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that seemed
to support the changes he had been imposing on the country. When he
released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang’s reforms, and
the people felt comforted and accepted them more easily.
Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the
freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with the facts. The
past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.
A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number for a
group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of history.
As Machiavelli himself observed, the Romans used this device when they
transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have installed two
consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served by twelve
lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the consuls. The king
had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in a great spectacle that
stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only transferring it to a
special “chief of the ceremony, whom they called the King of the sacrifice.”
These and similar gestures satisfied the people and kept them from
clamoring for the monarchy’s return.
Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public display
of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition and
few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Florence
had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who flouted its
traditions. Cosimo de’ Medici made a show of enthusiastic support for the
republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the control of his
wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance of a republic;
in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly enacted a radical
change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.
Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from
conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet
when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer
opposition from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His
theories challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall
with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his
revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he
faced, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents
and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually
die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the courtier’s game.
Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later became
more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to tradition. Identify
the elements in your revolution that can be made to seem to build on the
past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile let
your theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect past
protocol. This is true in every arena—science being no exception.
Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist. If their reform is
too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety
and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less
innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant
nation
