LAW 25
RE-CREATE YOURSELF
JUDGMENT
Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by
forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the
audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define
it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and
actions—your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger
than life.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Julius Caesar made his first significant mark on Roman society in 65 B.C.,
when he assumed the post of aedile, the official in charge of grain
distribution and public games. He began his entrance into the public eye by
organizing a series of carefully crafted and well-timed spectacles—wild-
beast hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests. On several
occasions, he paid for these spectacles out of his own pocket. To the
common man, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these much-
loved events. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his
popularity among the masses served as the foundation of his power. He had
created an image of himself as a great public showman.
The man who intends to make his fortune in this ancient capital of the world
[Rome] must be a chameleon susceptible of reflecting the colors of the
atmosphere that surrounds him—a Proteus apt to assume every form, every
shape. He must be supple, flexible, insinuating, close, inscrutable, often
base, sometimes sincere, sometimes perfidious, always concealing a part of
his knowledge, indulging in but one tone of voice, patient, a perfect master
of his own countenance, as cold as ice when any other man would be all
fire; and if unfortunately he is not religious at heart—a very common
occurrence for a soul possessing the above requisites-he must have religion
in his mind, that is to say, on his face, on his lips, in his manners; he must
suffer quietly, if he be an honest man, the necessity of knowing himself an
arrant hypocrite. The man whose soul would loathe such a life should leave
Rome and seek his fortune elsewhere. I do not know whether I am praising
or excusing myself, but of all those qualities I possessed but one—namely,
flexibility.
MEMOIRS, GIOVANNI CASANOVA, 1725-1798
In 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rival leaders,
Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the
stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he
wandered in the darkness back to his camp at the Rubicon, the river that
divides Italy from Gaul, where he had been campaigning. To march his
army back into Italy across the Rubicon would mean the beginning of a war
with Pompey.
Before his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like an
actor on stage, a precursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to an end,
he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of the river—a
very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going across a bridge over
the Rubicon—and pronounced, “Let us accept this as a sign from the Gods
and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double-dealing
enemies. The die is cast.” All of this he spoke portentously and
dramatically, gesturing toward the river and looking his generals in the eye.
He knew that these generals were uncertain in their support, but his oratory
overwhelmed them with a sense of the drama of the moment, and of the
need to seize the time. A more prosaic speech would never have had the
same effect. The generals rallied to his cause; Caesar and his army crossed
the Rubicon and by the following year had vanquished Pompey, making
Caesar dictator of Rome.
In warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was as
skilled a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing them in
feats of bravery and endurance. He entered battle astride the strongest
mount, so that his soldiers would see him in the thick of battle, urging them
on, always positioning himself in the center, a godlike symbol of power and
a model for them to follow. Of all the armies in Rome, Caesar’s was the
most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people who had
attended his entertainments, had come to identify with him and with his
cause.
After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing
like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more
spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to
the death among the Roman nobility. He organized enormous mock naval
battles on an artificial lake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A
giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian
Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to
Rome lined with visitors’ tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the
city for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to
Rome after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant
public spectacles.
These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they
dramatically enhanced the public’s sense of Caesar’s character, and made
him seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of
which he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the
most spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was
notoriously vain about his appearance—it was said that one reason he
enjoyed being honored by the Senate and people was that on these
occasions he could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a
masterful orator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the
moment to end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate
a surprise into his public appearances—a startling announcement that would
heighten their drama.
Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March—March 15—in the year 44 B.C.,
a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded him in the
senate and stabbed him to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth’s
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing him to die covered and decent.
According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his old
friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek, and
as if rehearsed for the end of a play: “You too, my child?”
Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds
unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience would
be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater seemed
to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form. Like a
religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common man.
Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive
interest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making himself an actor
and director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been
scripted; he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of
how he appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his
repertoire, building drama into his speeches, staging into his public
appearances. His gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp
them instantly. He became immensely popular.
Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him, you
must learn to enlarge your actions through dramatic techniques such as
surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification.
Also like him, you must be constantly aware of your audience—of what
will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place
yourself at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at
any cost.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her
husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be a
writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the
time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish her
independence and make her living by writing.
Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to confront
certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you had to
have money. For a woman, money could only come through marriage or
prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by writing.
Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an inheritance.
In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor, he told her,
“You should make babies, Madame, not literature.”
Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the end,
though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever done—
a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of her own
making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready-made role,
that of the second-rate artist who wrote mostly for other women. Dudevant
decided that if she had to play a role, she would turn the game around: She
would play the part of a man.
In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant’s first major novel, Indiana. She
had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, “George Sand,” and all of
Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had
sometimes worn men’s clothes before creating “George Sand” (she had
always found men’s shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as a
public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men’s coats, gray
hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked cigars
and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to dominate the
conversation or to use a saucy word.
This strange “male/female” writer fascinated the public. And unlike other
women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male artists.
She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the most
famous artists of Europe—Musset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did the
wooing, and also the abandoning—she moved on at her discretion.
Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona protected
her from the public’s prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed playing the
part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also realized that
the character of “George Sand” could grow stale or predictable, and to
avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter the character
she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous men, she would
begin meddling in politics, leading demonstrations, inspiring student
rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the character she had
created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped reading her
novels, the larger-than-life theatricality of that character has continued to
fascinate and inspire.
Interpretation
Throughout Sand’s public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man. But
in her journals and to her closest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she
confessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for
public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her.
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she created
a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a persona that
attracted attention and gave her presence.
Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And once
you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is limited to the tiny
amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to assume.
An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean power,
and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of your own
making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious and
resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you
responsible for your own creation.
Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it is
not “you”; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it
personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical
presence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the
front rows marvel at your audacity.
Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not
mean by 
that that he feels, but that he excels in simulating, though he feels nothing.
Denis Diderot, 1713-1784
KEYS TO POWER
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you
are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, your parents, your
friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The
Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop
allowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake yourself into a
character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your
greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an artist—
an artist creating yourself.
In fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For
thousands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to
shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only
kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art, and
consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that society
demanded of them, and had little self-consciousness.
A shift in this condition can be detected in Velázquez’s painting Las
Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing
before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that has its back to
us—we cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her attendants, and one
of the court dwarves, all watching him work. The people posing for the
painting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a
mirror on the back wall—the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting
somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture.
The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power and
the ability to determine one’s own position in society. For Velázquez, the
artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a
sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one
controlling the image—their image. Velázquez no longer saw himself as the
slavish, dependent artist. He had remade himself into a man of power. And
indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their image
in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and
bohemians. Today the concept of self-creation has slowly filtered down to
the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez,
you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the
painting, and to create your own image.
The first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness—being
aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance and
emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sincere.
People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tiresome
and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take them
seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy, but
sympathy soon turns to scorn and irritation at their self obsessiveness—they
are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious part of us wants to deny
them the satisfaction.
Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and
heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don’t
have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can
understand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No ruler or leader
could possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real.
So learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or
her face to the emotion required.
The second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the
George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that
compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage. This
was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common country
man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had but
would delight in electing. Although many of these qualities came naturally
to him, he played them up—the hat and clothes, the beard. (No president
before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to use
photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the
“homespun president.”
Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or a
single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time—it is an unfolding
event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important elements
in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could sometimes
complete his escape acts in seconds—but he drew them out to minutes, to
make the audience sweat.
The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, according
to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great rulers from Napoleon to Mao
Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their public.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging political
events in a particular order and rhythm.
At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in the
midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate.
Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a kind of retreat. He
said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments. He even refused to
meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transition. By the
time of Roosevelt’s inauguration the country was in a state of high anxiety.
In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powerful
speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely
new direction, sweeping away the timid gestures of his predecessors. From
then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions—cabinet
appointments, bold legislation—unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The
period after the inauguration became known as the “Hundred Days,” and its
success in altering the country’s mood partly stemmed from Roosevelt’s
clever pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in
suspense, then hit them with a series of bold gestures that seemed all the
more momentous because they came from nowhere. You must learn to
orchestrate events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at
once, but unfolding them in a way that heightens their dramatic effect.
Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and
deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt
Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed
Communist sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify
planned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin,
charming them while fooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his
responses, and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he
puffed away, knowing the head of the committee liked cigars. And indeed
he proceeded to beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that
were ambiguous, funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt
tirade, he ran circles around them with a staged production, and they let him
off scot-free.
Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an
action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your
boldness. Caesar’s dramatic c
