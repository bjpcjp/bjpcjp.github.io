LAW 41
AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN’S SHOES
JUDGMENT
What happens first always appears better and more original than what
comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will
have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get
lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish
your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing
father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way.
THE EXCELLENCE OF BEING FIRST
Many would have shone like the very phoenix in their occupations if others
had not preceded them. Being first is a great advantage; with eminence,
twice as good. Deal the first hand and you will win the upper ground....
Those who go first win fame by right of birth, and those who follow are like
second sons, contenting themselves with meager portions.... Solomon opted
wisely for pacifism, yielding warlike things to his father. By changing
course he found it easier to become a hero.... And our great Philip II
governed the entire world from the throne of his prudence, astonishing the
ages. If his unconquered father was a model of energy, Philip was a
paradigm of prudence.... This sort of novelty has helped the well-advised
win a place in the roll of the great. Without leaving their own art, the
ingenious leave the common path and take, even in professions gray with
age, new steps toward eminence. Horace yielded epic poetry to Virgil, and
Martial the lyric to Horace. Terence opted for comedy, Persius for satire,
each hoping to be first in his genre. Bold fancy never succumbed to facile
imitation.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
When Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious fifty-five-year reign, all
eyes focused on his great-grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis
XV. Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great a leader as the Sun
King? Louis XIV had transformed a country on the verge of civil war into
the preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been
difficult—he had been old and tired—but it was hoped that the child would
develop into the kind of strong ruler who would reinvigorate the land and
add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid.
To this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors,
men who would instruct him in the arts of statecraft, in the methods that the
Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But when
Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over him: He
no longer had to study or please others or prove himself. He stood alone at
the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command. He could
do as he wished.
In the first years of his reign, Louis gave himself over to pleasure,
leaving the government in the hands of a trusted minister, André-Hercule de
Fleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man who needed to
sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became
clear that this was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in
governing. His main worry was not France’s finances, or a possible war
with Spain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was
not hunting deer, or chasing young girls, he whiled away his time at the
gambling tables, losing huge sums in a single night.
The court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the ruler. Gambling and lavish
parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with the future
of France—they poured their energies into charming the king, angling for
titles that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet positions
demanding little work but paying huge salaries. Parasites flocked to the
court, and the state’s debts swelled.
In 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman of
middle-class origin who had managed to rise through her charms, her
intelligence, and a good marriage. Madame de Pompadour became the
official royal mistress; she also became France’s arbiter of taste and fashion.
But the Madame had political ambitions as well, and she eventually
emerged as the country’s unofficial prime minister—it was she, not Louis,
who wielded hiring-and-firing power over France’s most important
ministers.
As he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the grounds of
Versailles he built a brothel, Parc aux Cerfs, which housed some of the
prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and hidden stair-
cases gave Louis access at all hours. After Madame de Pompadour died, in
1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by Madame du Barry, who soon
came to dominate the court, and who, like de Pompadour before her, began
to meddle in affairs of state. If a minister did not please her he would find
himself fired. All of Europe was aghast when du Barry, the daughter of a
baker, managed to arrange the firing of Étienne de Choiseul, the foreign
minister and France’s most able diplomat. He had shown her too little
respect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their nests in
Versailles, and enticed Louis’s interest in astrology, the occult, and
fraudulent business deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken
over France years before had only grown worse with age.
The motto that became attached to Louis’s reign was “Après moi, le
déluge”—“After me the flood,” or, Let France rot after I am gone. And
indeed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country
and his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI
inherited a realm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis
XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the
country descended into revolution. In 1792 the republic introduced by the
French Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a
new name, “Louis the Last.” A few months later he kneeled on the
guillotine, his about-to-be-severed head stripped of all the radiance and
power that the Sun King had invested in the crown.
Interpretation
From a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis
XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble in
his presence. A cook once made a mistake in preparing a dish and
committed suicide rather than face the king’s wrath. Louis XIV had many
mistresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with
the most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles:
Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his
own palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this
was a new order he had founded, one without precedent. He made Versailles
the centerpiece of his reign, a place that all the powerful of Europe envied
and visited with a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great void—the
decaying monarchy of France—and filled it with his own symbols and
radiant power.
Louis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who inherit
something large or who follow in a great man’s footsteps. It would seem
easy for a son or successor to build on the grand foundation left for them,
but in the realm of power the opposite is true. The pampered, indulged son
almost always squanders the inheritance, for he does not start with the
father’s need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what impels
men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and decay are
left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV inevitably
succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the Sun King’s
authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality, a kind of Las
Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that the oppressed
peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the Revolution they
looted it with glee.
LIFE OF PERICLES
As a young man Pericles was inclined to shrink from facing the people. One
reason for this was that he was considered to bear a distinct resemblance to
the tyrant Pisistratus, and when men who were well on in years remarked
on the charm of Pericles’ voice and the smoothness and fluency of his
speech, they were astonished at the resemblance between the two. The fact
that he was rich and that he came of a distinguished family and possessed
exceedingly powerful friends made the fear of ostracism very real to him,
and at the beginning of his career he took no part in politics but devoted
himself to soldiering, in which he showed great daring and enterprise.
However, the time came when Aristides was dead. Themistocles in exile,
and Cimon frequently absent on distant campaigns. Then at last Pericles
decided to attach himself to the people’s party and to take up the cause of
the poor and the many instead of that of the rich and the few, in spite of the
fact that this was quite contrary to his own temperament, which was
thoroughly aristocratic. He was afraid, apparently, of being suspected of
aiming at a dictatorship: so that when he saw that Cimon’s sympathies were
strongly with the nobles and that Cimon was the idol of the aristocratic
party, Pericles began to ingratiate himself with the people, partly for self-
preservation and partly by way of securing power against his rival. He now
entered upon a new mode of life. He was never to be seen walking in any
street except the one which led to the market-place and the council
chamber.
 
THE LIFE OF PERICLES, PLUTARCH, c. A.D. 46-120
 
Louis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or successor
of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from nothing, to
denigrate the past and his inheritance, and to move in a totally new
direction, creating his own world. Assuming you have the choice, it would
be better to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself where there is a
vacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring order out of chaos
without having to compete with another star in the sky. Power depends on
appearing larger than other people, and when you are lost in the shadow of
the father, the king, the great predecessor, you cannot possibly project such
a presence.
But when they began to make sovereignty hereditary, the children quickly 
degenerated from their fathers; and, so far from trying to equal their
father’s 
virtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than to excel 
all the rest in idleness, indulgence, and every other variety of pleasure.
Niccolò Machiavelli, 1469-1527
THE LIFE OF PIETRO PERUGINO, PAINTER, c.1450-1523
How beneficial poverty may sometimes be to those with talent, and how it
may serve as a powerful goad to make them perfect or excellent in whatever
occupation they might choose, can be seen very clearly in the actions of
Pietro Perugino. Wishing by means of his ability to attain some respectable
rank, after leaving disastrous calamities behind in Perugia and coming to
Florence, he remained there many months in poverty, sleeping in a chest,
since he had no other bed; he turned night into day, and with the greatest
zeal continually applied himself to the study of his profession. After painting
had become second nature to him, Pietro’s only pleasure was always to be
working in his craft and constantly to be painting. And because he always
had the dread of poverty before his eyes, he did things to make money which
he probably would not have bothered to do had he not been forced to
support himself. Perhaps wealth would have closed to him and his talent the
path to excellence just as poverty had opened it up to him, but need spurred
him on since he desired to rise from such a miserable and lowly position-if
not perhaps to the summit and supreme height of excellence, then at least to
a point where he could have enough to live on. For this reason, he took no
notice of cold, hunger, discomfort, inconvenience, toil or shame if he could
only live one day in ease and repose; and he would always say—and as if it
were a proverb—that after bad weather, good weather must follow, and that
during the good weather houses must be built for shelter in times of need.
LIVES OF THE ARTISTS, GIORGIO VASARI, 1511-1574
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man—an intense
dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip’s cunning,
cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring,
and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he
had to make himself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would
force himself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a
man of few words, and he would not lose precious time in pursuit of
pleasures that brought no glory. Alexander also resented the fact that Philip
had conquered most of Greece: “My father will go on conquering till there
is nothing extraordinary left for me to do,” he once complained. While other
sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of
leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip’s
name from history by surpassing his accomplishments.
Alexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A
Thessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucephalus to
sell to Philip. None of the king’s grooms could get near the horse—it was
far too savage—and Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a
useless beast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and
commented, “What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to
manage him!” When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had
enough, and challenged him to take on the horse. He called the merchant
back, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fall and learn a bitter
lesson. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not only did he
mount Bucephalus, he managed to ride him at full gallop, taming the horse
that would later carry him all the way to India. The courtiers applauded
wildly, but Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a rival to his power.
Alexander’s defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men had
a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword as if to
strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however, the king stumbled.
Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, “Men of Macedonia, see there
the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot pass from
one table to another without falling.”
When Alexander was eighteen, a disgruntled courtier murdered Philip.
As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city rose up in
rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip’s advisers counseled
Alexander, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done
and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He
marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious
towns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency.
As a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often wanes,
and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to defy.
But Alexander’s loathing of his father did not end with Philip’s death. Once
he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on Persia, the prize that had
eluded his father, who had dreamed of conquering Asia. If he defeated the
Persians, Alexander would finally surpass Philip in glory and fame.
Alexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a Persian
force numbering over a million. Before engaging the Persians in battle he
passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town’s main temple, there
stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of the rind of the cornel tree.
Legend had it that any man who could undo these cords—the Gordian knot
—would rule the world. Many had tried to untie the enormous and intricate
knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he could not possibly untie
the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword and with one slash cut it in
half. This symbolic gesture showed the world that he would not do as
others, but would blaze his own path.
Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most
expected him to stop there—it was a great triumph, enough to secure his
fame for eternity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own deeds
as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past, and he
wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to outshine the
present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all known
limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from going
farther.
Interpretation
Alexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of a
famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory and
power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most often
manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with little or
nothing. A desperate urge impels him to succeed—he has nothing to lose by
cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his own to
compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in himself—to
believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after all, it worked
for him.
When a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and oppressive,
imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in circumstances
totally different from those in which the father himself began. Instead of
allowing the son to go in a new direction, the father will try to put him in
his own shoes, perhaps secretly wishing the boy will fail, as Philip half
wanted to see Alexander thrown from Bucephalus. Fathers envy their sons’
youth and vigor, after all, and their desire is to control and dominate. The
sons of such men tend to become cowed and cautious, terrified of losing
what their fathers have gained.
The son will never step out of his father’s shadow unless he adopts the
ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage the past, create your own
kingdom, put the father in the shadows instead of letting him do the same to
you. If you cannot materially start from ground zero—it would be foolish to
renounce an inheritance—you can at least begin from ground zero
psychologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new
direction. Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are
impediments to power. Be merciless with the past, then—not only with your
father and his father but with your own earlier achievements. Only the weak
rest on their laurels and dote on past triumphs; in the game of power there is
never time to rest.
THE PROBLEM OF PAUL MORPHY
The slightest acquaintance with chess shows one that it is a play-substitute
for the art of war and indeed it has been a favorite recreation of some of the
greatest military leaders, from William the Conqueror to Napoleon. In the
contest between the opposing armies the same principles of both strategy
and tactics are displayed as in actual war, the same foresight and powers of
calculation are necessary, the same capacity for divining the plans of the
opponent, and the rigor with which decisions are followed by their
consequences is, if anything, even more ruthless. More than that, it is plain
that the unconscious motive actuating the players is not the mere love of
pugnacity characteristic of all competitive games, but the grimmer one of
father-murder. It is true that the original goal of capturing the king has been
given up, but from the point of view of motive there is, except in respect of
crudity, not appreciable change in the present goal of sterilizing him in
immobility.... “Checkmate” means literally “the king is dead.” ... Our
knowledge of the unconscious motivation of chess-playing tells us that what
it represented could only have been the wish to overcome the father in an
acceptable way.... It is no doubt significant that [nineteenth-century chess
champion Paul] Morphy’s soaring odyssey into the higher realms
