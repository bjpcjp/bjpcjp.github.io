LAW 9
WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH
ARGUMENT
JUDGMENT
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is
really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger
and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more
powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without
saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In 131 B.C., the Roman consul Publius Crassus Dives Mucianus, laying
siege to the Greek town of Pergamus, found himself in need of a battering
ram to force through the town’s walls. He had seen a couple of hefty ship’s
masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he ordered that the
larger of these be sent to him immediately. The military engineer in Athens
who received the order felt certain that the consul really wanted the smaller
of the masts. He argued endlessly with the soldiers who delivered the
request: The smaller mast, he told them, was much better suited to the task.
And indeed it would be easier to transport.
The soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man to argue
with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that would
work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew
diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and
they had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their
leader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow
his expertise and obey.
After they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What
was the point, he asked himself, in obeying an order that would lead to
failure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would
see how much more effective it was and reward him justly.
When the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for an
explanation. They described to him how the engineer had argued endlessly
for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one.
Mucianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the siege, or
consider the importance of breaching the walls before the town received
reinforcements. All he could think about was the impudent engineer, whom
he ordered to be brought to him immediately.
Arriving a few days later, the engineer gladly explained to the consul,
one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on and on, using
the same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He said it was wise to
listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack was only tried with the
battering ram he had sent, the consul would not regret it. Mucianus let him
finish, then had him stripped naked before the soldiers and flogged and
scourged with rods until he died.
THE SULTAN AND THE VIZIER
A vizier had served his master for some thirty years and was known and
admired for his loyalty, truthfulness, and devotion to God. His honesty,
however, had made him many enemies in the court, who spread stories of
his duplicity and perfidy. They worked on the sultan day in and day out until
he too came to distrust the innocent vizier and finally ordered the man who
had served him so well to be put to death. In this realm, those condemned to
death were tied up and thrown into the pen where the sultan kept his fiercest
hunting dogs. The dogs would promptly tear the victim to pieces. Before
being thrown to the dogs, however, the vizier asked for one last request. “I
would like ten days’ respite,” he said, “so that I can pay my debts, collect
any money due to me, return items that people have put in my care, and
share out my goods among the members of my family and my children and
appoint a guardian for them.” After receiving a guarantee that the vizier
would not try to escape, the sultan granted this request. The vizier hurried
home, collected one hundred gold pieces, then paid a visit to the huntsman
who looked after the sultan’s dogs. He offered this man the one hundred
gold pieces and said, “Let me look after the dogs for ten days.” The
huntsman agreed, and for the next ten days the vizier cared for the beasts
with great attention, grooming them well and feeding them handsomely. By
the end of the ten days they were eating out of his hand.
On the eleventh day the vizier was called before the sultan, the charges
were repeated, and the sultan watched as the vizier was tied up and thrown
to the dogs. Yet when the beasts saw him, they ran up to him with wagging
tails. They nibbled affectionately at his shoulders and began playing with
him. The sultan and the other witnesses were amazed, and the sultan asked
the vizier why the dogs had spared his life. The vizier replied, “I have
looked after these dogs for ten days. The sultan has seen the result for
himself. I have looked after you for thirty years, and what is the result? I am
condemned to death on the strength of accusations brought by my enemies.
”The sultan blushed with shame. He not only pardoned the vizier but gave
him a fine set of clothes and handed over to him the men who had slandered
his reputation. The noble vizier set them free and continued to treat them
with kindness.

Interpretation
The engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his
life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in
a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller
ram would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not necessarily
better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually
understand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the consul
possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed
diagrams and explained the theories behind his advice?
The military engineer was the quintessence of the Arguer, a type found
everywhere among us. The Arguer does not understand that words are never
neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intelligence of
one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the person he is
dealing with. Since each man believes that he is right, and words will rarely
convince him otherwise, the arguer’s reasoning falls on deaf ears. When
cornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Once he has made
the other person feel insecure and inferior in his beliefs, the eloquence of
Socrates could not save the situation.
It is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who stand
above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions and
reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the correctness
of your ideas indirectly.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1502, in Florence, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the works
department of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. It had once been a
magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly
bored a hole through it where there should have been a figure’s legs,
generally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence’s mayor, had contemplated
trying to save the block by commissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on it,
or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the stone
had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it
gathered dust in the dark halls of the church.
This was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great
Michelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone,
they said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent
raw material. Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and
came to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine figure from it, by
adapting the pose to the way the rock had been mutilated. Soderini argued
that this was a waste of time—nobody could salvage such a disaster—but
he finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he would
depict a young David, sling in hand.
Weeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touches on the statue,
Soderini entered the studio. Fancying himself a bit of a connoisseur, he
studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it was
magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized that
Soderini was standing in a place right under the giant figure and did not
have the proper perspective. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini to
follow him up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his chisel,
as well as a bit of marble dust that lay on the planks. With Soderini just a
few feet below him on the scaffolding, Michelangelo started to tap lightly
with the chisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to fall
little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave every
appearance of working on it. After a few minutes of this charade he stood
aside: “Look at it now.” “I like it better,” replied Soderini, “you’ve made it
come alive.”
Interpretation
Michelangelo knew that by changing the shape of the nose he might ruin
the entire sculpture. Yet Soderini was a patron who prided himself on his
aesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain
Michelangelo nothing, it would put future commissions in jeopardy.
Michelangelo was too clever to argue. His solution was to change
Soderini’s perspective (literally bringing him closer to the nose) without
making him realize that this was the cause of his misperception.
Fortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the
perfection of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini
believe he had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through
actions rather than argument: No one is offended, and your point is proven.
THE WORKS OF AMASIS
When Apries had been deposed in the way I have described, Amasis came to
the throne. He belonged to the district of Sais and was a native of the town
called Siuph. At first the Egyptians were inclined to be contemptuous, and
did not think much of him because of his humble and undistinguished
origin; but later on he cleverly brought them to heel, without having
recourse to harsh measures. Amongst his innumerable treasures, he had a
gold footbath, which he and his guests used on occasion to wash their feet
in. This he broke up, and with the material had a statue made to one of the
gods, which he then set up in what he thought the most suitable spot in the
city. The Egyptians constantly coming upon the statue, treated it with
profound reverence, and as soon as Amasis heard of the effect it had upon
them, he called a meeting and revealed the fact that the deeply revered
statue was once a footbath, which they washed their feet and pissed and
vomited in. He went on to say that his own case was much the same, in that
once he had been only an ordinary person and was now their king; so that
just as they had come to revere the transformed footbath, so they had better
pay honor and respect to him, too. In this way the Egyptians were
persuaded to accept him as their master.
 
THE HISTORIES. HERODOTUS. FIFTH CENTURY B.C.
KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power you must learn to judge your moves by their long-
term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or gain
a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain how it
affects the people you’re arguing with: They may appear to agree with you
politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something you said
inadvertently even offended them—words have that insidious ability to be
interpreted according to the other person’s mood and insecurities. Even the
best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come to distrust the
slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with someone, we often
revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit.
Understand this: Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in the
heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We will
quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded by
bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more powerful
and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to see—“Yes, now
the statue’s nose does look just right.” There are no offensive words, no
possibility of misinterpretation. No one can argue with a demonstrated
proof. As Baltasar Gracián remarks, “The truth is generally seen, rarely
heard.”
Sir Christopher Wren was England’s version of the Renaissance man. He
had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and
physiology. Yet during his extremely long career as England’s most
celebrated architect he was often told by his patrons to make impractical
changes in his designs. Never once did he argue or offend. He had other
ways of proving his point.
In 1688 Wren designed a magnificent town hall for the city of
Westminster. The mayor, however, was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous.
He told Wren he was afraid the second floor was not secure, and that it
could all come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded
that Wren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate
engineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the
mayor’s fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was
grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that
the columns stopped just short of the ceiling.
They were dummies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor
could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original
design worked and the columns were unnecessary.
The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not get
defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them literally
and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than argument.
A heckler once interrupted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a speech
in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. “You were a colleague of
Stalin’s,” the heckler yelled, “why didn’t you stop him then?” Khrushschev
apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, “Who said that?” No
hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds of tense
silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, “Now you know why I
didn’t stop him.” Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin was
afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain
death, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin—had made
them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting the
leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no
more argument was necessary.
The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The
power of a symbol—a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional
event—is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In
1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some frustrating negotiations
with the Israelis over the return of part of the Sinai desert that they had
seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke off a tense meeting and decided
to do some sight-seeing. He paid a visit to the ruins of the ancient fortress of
Masada, known to all Israelis as the place where seven hundred Jewish
warriors committed mass suicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the
Roman troops besieging them. The Israelis instantly understood the
message of Kissinger’s visit: He was indirectly accusing them of courting
mass suicide. Although the visit did not by itself change their minds, it
made them think far more seriously than any direct warning would have.
Symbols like this one carry great emotional significance.
When aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the
indirect route. And also choose your battles carefully. If it does not matter
in the long run whether the other person agrees with you—or if time and
their own experience will make them understand what you mean—then it is
best not even to bother with a demonstration. Save your energy and walk
away.
GOD AND ABRAHAM
The Most High God had promised that He would not take Abraham’s soul
unless the man wanted to die and asked Him to do so. When Abraham’s life
was drawing to a close, and God determined to seize him, He sent an angel
in the guise of a decrepit old man who was almost entirely incapacitated.
The old man stopped outside Abraham door and said to him, “Oh Abraham,
I would like something to eat.” Abraham was amazed to hear him say this.
“Die,” exclaimed Abraham. It would be better for you than to go on living
in that condition.”
Abraham always kept food ready at his home for passing guests. So he gave
the old man a bowl containing broth and meat with bread crumbs. The old
man sat down to eat. He swallowed laboriously, with great effort, and once
when he took some food it dropped from his hand, scattering on the ground.
“Oh Abraham,” he said, “help me to eat.” Abraham took the food in his
hand and lifted it to the old man’s lips. But it slid down his beard and over
his chest. “What is your age, old man?” asked Abraham. The old man
mentioned a number of years slightly greater than Abraham’s old age. Then
Abraham exclaimed: “Oh Lord Our God, take me unto You before I reach
this man’s age and sink into the same condition as he is in now.” No sooner
had Abraham spoken those words than God took possession of his soul.

Authority: Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only

REVERSAL
Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and
cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a lie.
In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you can
muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from your
deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the more emotional and certain you
appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.
This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count
Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around
the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money.
Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police,
rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sheriff Richards, of
Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being
conned out of $10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig down to a hotel
in Chicago.
Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking
down the barrel of a gun. “What seems to be the problem?” he calmly
asked. “You son of a bitch,” yelled the sheriff, “I’m going to kill you. You
conned me with that damn box of yours!” Lustig feigned confusion. “You
mean it’s not working?” he asked. “You know it’s not working,” replied the
sheriff. “But that’s impossible,” said Lustig. “There’s no way it couldn’t be
working. Did you operate it properly?” “I did exactly what you told me to
do,” said the sheriff. “No, you must have done something wrong,” said
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently
lowered.
Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box’s operation,
completely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and
argued less forcefully. “Look,” said Lustig, “I’ll give you your money back
right now. I’ll also give you written instructions on how to work the
machine and I’ll come out to Oklahoma to make sure it’s working properly.
There’s no way you can lose on that.” The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To
satisfy him totally, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and
gave them to him, tellin
