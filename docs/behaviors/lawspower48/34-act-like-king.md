LAW 34
BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO
BE TREATED LIKE ONE
JUDGMENT
The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated: In the
long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you.
For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By
acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem
destined to wear a crown.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the king, Charles
X, to abdicate. A commission of the highest authorities in the land gathered
to choose a successor, and the man they picked was Louis-Philippe, the
Duke of Orléans.
From the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a different
kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of the
royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been given
it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was that he
disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty; he had more friends among
the bankers than among the nobility; and his style was not to create a new
kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay his status, the
better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk who had called
him to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associated with Louis-
Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray hat and
umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as if he
were a bourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philippe invited James
Rothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated
him as an equal. And unlike any king before him, not only did he talk
business with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he
loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.
As the reign of the “bourgeois king” plodded on, people came to despise
him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king, and
within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the growing class of the
poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor governed as a man of
the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden
soon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they
treated him with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip
organized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him—and
in public—for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior.
Eventually the workers’ insurrections that had brought down Louis-
Philippe’s predecessor began to reemerge, and the king put them down with
force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution of the
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule
prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune,
and the fortunes of the bankers—not a way to inspire loyalty among the
citizenry.
Never lose your self-respect, nor be too familiar with yourself when you are
alone. Let your integrity itself be your own standard of rectitude, and be
more indebted to the severity of your own judgment of yourself than to all
external precepts. Desist from unseemly conduct, rather out of respect for
your own virtue than for the strictures of external authority. Come to hold
yourself in awe, and you will have no need of Seneca’s imaginary tutor.
 
BALTASAR GRACIÁN, 1601-1658
In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for
electoral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By
February the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the populace,
Louis-Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as a
replacement. But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people
sensed they could push the king around. The demonstrations turned into a
full-fledged revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets.
On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the palace.
With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-Philippe
abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no successor, nor
even the suggestion of one—his whole government folded up and dissolved
like a traveling circus leaving town.
Interpretation
Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally pertains to
kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a new
world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citizens.
He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was certainly on its
way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predicting a change in the
dynamics of power.
The bourgeois king’s hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but
soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like
them at all—that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to
encourage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more
equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater. The
French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some
presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power
during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and
certainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an
imperial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis-
Philippe fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected
Napoleon’s grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they
hoped he would re-create the great general’s powerful aura, erasing the
awkward memory of the “bourgeois king.”
Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying to
create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically the
same. But the people whom this false gesture is intended to impress will
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
power—that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person’s fate.
The only kind of common touch that works is the kind affected by Franklin
Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the
common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never
pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.
Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumminess
gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit
contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth
the guillotine—the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they
were never there.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary
voyages, many around him believed he came from the Italian aristocracy.
This view was passed into history through a biography written after the
explorer’s death by his son, which describes him as a descendant of a Count
Colombo of the Castle of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn was said
to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius, and two of
his first cousins were supposedly direct descendants of an emperor of Con
stantinople. An illustrious background indeed. But it was nothing more than
illustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico
Colombo, a humble weaver who had opened a wine shop when Christopher
was a young man, and who then made his living by selling cheese.
Columbus himself had created the myth of his noble background,
because from early on he felt that destiny had singled him out for great
things, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he acted
as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an uneventful career
as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus, originally from Genoa,
settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble background, he
married into an established Lisbon family that had excellent connections
with Portuguese royalty.
Through his in-laws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of
Portugal, João II, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed
at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any
discoveries he achieved would be made in the king’s name, Columbus
wanted a series of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the
office of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future
commerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for
all time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously
been a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigation, he could
not work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had
absolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his
petition included no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just
vague promises.
When Columbus finished his pitch, João II smiled: He politely declined
the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus must have
noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned down the
sailor’s demands, he treated them as legitimate. He neither laughed at
Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials. In fact the king
was impressed by the boldness of Columbus’s requests, and clearly felt
comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently. The
meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were correct: By
asking for the moon, he had instantly raised his own status, for the king
assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on himself were mad,
which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it.
HIPPOCLEIDES AT SICYON
In the next generation the family became much more famous than before
through the distinction conferred upon it by Cleisthenes the master of
Sicyon. Cleisthenes... had a daughter, Agarista, whom he wished to marry
to the best man in all Greece. So during the Olympic games, in which he
had himself won the chariot race, he had a public announcement made, to
the effect that any Greek who thought himself good enough to become
Cleisthenes’ son-in-law should present himself in Sicyon within sixty days—
or sooner if he wished—because he intended, within the year following the
sixtieth day, to betroth his daughter to her future husband. Cleisthenes had
had a race-track and a wrestling-ring specially made for his purpose, and
presently the suitors began to arrive—every man of Greek nationality who
had something to be proud of either in his country or in himself....
Cleisthenes began by asking each [of the numerous suitors] in turn to name
his country and parentage; then he kept them in his house for a year, to get
to know them well, entering into conversation with them sometimes singly,
sometimes all together, and testing each of them for his manly qualities and
temper, education and manners.... But the most important test of all was
their behaviour at the dinner-table. All this went on throughout their stay in
Sicyon, and all the time he entertained them handsomely. For one reason or
another it was the two Athenians who impressed Cleisthenes most
favourably, and of the two Tisander’s son Hippocleides came to be
preferred.... At last the day came which had been fixed for the betrothal, and
Cleisthenes had to declare his choice. He marked the day by the sacrifice of
a hundred oxen, and then gave a great banquet, to which not only the
suitors but everyone of note in Sicyon was invited. When dinner was over,
the suitors began to compete with each other in music and in talking in
company. In both these accomplishments it was Hippocleides who proved
by far the doughtiest champion, until at last, as more and more wine was
drunk, he asked the flute-player to play him a tune and began to dance to it.
Now it may well be that he danced to his own satisfaction; Cleisthenes,
however, who was watching the performance, began to have serious doubts
about the whole business. Presently, after a brief pause, Hippocleides sent
for a table; the table was brought, and Hippocleides, climbing on to it,
danced first some Laconian dances, next some Attic ones, and ended by
standing on his head and beating time with his legs in the air The Laconian
and Attic dances were bad enough; but Cleisthenes, though he already
loathed the thought of having a son-in-law like that, nevertheless restrained
himself and managed to avoid an outburst; but when he saw Hippocleides
beating time with his legs, he could bear it no longer. “Son of Tisander,”he
cried, “you have danced away your marriage.”
THE HISTORIES, HERODOTUS, FIFTH CENTURY B.C.
A few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese
connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving
subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and
princes. To all these men he repeated his request for financing for a voyage
to the west—and also for the rights he had demanded from João II. Some,
such as the powerful duke of Medina, wanted to help, but could not, since
they lacked the power to grant him the titles and rights he wanted. But
Columbus would not back down. He soon realized that only one person
could meet his demands: Queen Isabella. In 1487 he finally managed a
meeting with the queen, and although he could not convince her to finance
the voyage, he completely charmed her, and became a frequent guest in the
palace.
In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who centuries
earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on her
treasury lifted, Isabella felt she could finally respond to the demands of her
explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the
salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important,
she had a contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on
which he had insisted. The only one she denied—and only in the contract’s
fine print—was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered:
an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause been
left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the
wealthiest family on the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.)
Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same
year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire
the best navigator he could find to help him get there.) The mission failed to
find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance an
even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then she
had come to see Columbus as destined for great things.
Interpretation
As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the sea
than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the latitude
and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, and
treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how to
sell himself How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low-
level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate himself with the highest royal and
aristocratic families?
Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all came
from the way he carried himself. He projected a sense of confidence that
was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence the
aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstart—it was a quiet and calm self-
assurance. In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the nobility
themselves. The powerful in the old-style aristocracies felt no need to prove
or assert themselves; being noble, they knew they always deserved more,
and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, for he
carried himself just the way they did—elevated above the crowd, destined
for greatness.
Understand: It is within your power to set your own price. How you carry
yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuffle
your feet and lower your head, people will assume this reflects your
character. But this behavior is not you—it is only how you have chosen to
present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the
Columbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born
to wear a crown.
With all great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which they owe
their power. In the actual act of deception they are overcome by belief in
themselves: it is this which then speaks so miraculously and compellingly
to those around them.
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900
KEYS TO POWER
As children, we start our lives with great exuberance, expecting and
demanding everything from the world. This generally carries over into our
first forays into society, as we begin our careers. But as we grow older the
rebuffs and failures we experience set up boundaries that only get firmer
with time. Coming to expect less from the world, we accept limitations that
are really self-imposed. We start to bow and scrape and apologize for even
the simplest of requests. The solution to such a shrinking of horizons is to
deliberately force ourselves in the opposite direction—to downplay the
failures and ignore the limitations, to make ourselves demand and expect as
much as the child. To accomplish this, we must use a particular strategy
upon ourselves. Call it the Strategy of the Crown.
The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and effect:
If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate
outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward
radiance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have
reasons to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner
sense of the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish.
This too radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the
Strategy of the Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit.
Take as an example those happy children who ask for whatever they want,
and get it. Their high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting
their wishes—just as Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.
Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth—the Theodoras of
Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis—have managed
to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own
greatness that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick is simple: Be
overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a
kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as
one.
The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to
make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating your
distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your difference is to
always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis-Philippe gave no
sense of being different from other people—he was the banker king. And
the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone sensed this
and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose, Louis-Philippe
seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled from his head.
Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance may
seem the king’s entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very
opposite of a royal demeanor.
Haile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in 1930,
was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but
there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he was far down the
line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik II.
Nevertheless, from an early age he exhibited a self-confidence and a royal
bearing that surprised everyone around him.
At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he
immediately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafari’s grace
under fire, his patience, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the ki
