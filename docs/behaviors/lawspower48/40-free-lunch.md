LAW 40
DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH
JUDGMENT
What is offered for free is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a
hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own
way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay
the full price—there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with
your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet
for power.
BURIED TREASURE
Many weak-minded persons in cities hope to discover property under the
surface of the earth and to make some profit from it. In the Maghrib there
are many Berber “students” who are unable to make a living by natural
ways and means. They approach well-to-do people with papers that have
torn margins and contain either non-Arabic writing or what they claim to
be the translation of a document written by the owner of buried treasures,
giving the clue to the hiding place. In this way, they try to get their
sustenance by [persuading the well-to-do] to send them out to dig and hunt
for treasure. Occasionally, one of these treasure hunters displays strange
information or some remarkable trick of magic with which he fools people
into believing his other claims, although, in fact, he knows nothing of magic
and its procedures.... The things that have been said about [treasure
hunting] have no scientific basis, nor are they based upon [factual]
information. It should be realized that although treasures are found, this
happens rarely and by chance, not by systematic search.... Those who are
deluded or afflicted by these things must take refuge in God from their
inability to make a living and their laziness in this respect. They should not
occupy themselves with absurdities and untrue stories.
 
THE MUQADDIMAH, IBN KHALDUN, 1332-1406
MONEY AND POWER
In the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and everything
has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often comes with a
psychological price tag—complicated feelings of obligation, compromises
with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on. The
powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resources: independence
and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep themselves free
of dangerous entanglements and worries.
Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategic
generosity, a variation on the old trick of “giving when you are about to
take.” By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obligation.
Generosity softens people up—to be deceived. By gaining a reputation for
liberality, you win people’s admiration while distracting them from your
power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the other
courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies.
Look at the masters of power—the Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths, the
Michelangelos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con
artists spend freely to swindle. Tight purse strings are unattractive—when
engaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself
but of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psychologically
charged, and that it is also a vessel of politeness and sociability. They make
the human side of money a weapon in their armory.
For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a
self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These
types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must learn to
recognize them—either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their
inflexibility to your advantage:
 
The Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of money. Cold
and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others solely
as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of wealth, they trample on
people’s sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wants to work with
the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which often proves
their undoing.
Greedy fish are the con artist’s bread and butter: Lured by the bait of easy
money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are easy to
deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers (not with
people) that they become blind to psychology, including their own. Either
avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed to your gain.
 
The Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs,
not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is
exactly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for
bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten elsewhere
for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often shabby;
perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as fast as a
high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits—not always in money
(though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and peace of
mind—discourage normal people from undertaking them, but for the
Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself.
These types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes are
contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the insecure
feeling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price. Don’t
argue with them or try to change them. Just mentally add up the cost, in
time and inner peace if not in hidden financial expense, of the irrational
pursuit of a bargain.
 
The Sadist. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a
way of asserting their power. They might, for example, make you wait for
money that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if
they hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job,
haggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for
something gives them the right to torture and abuse the seller. They have no
sense of the courtier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get
involved with this type, accepting a financial loss may be better in the long
run than getting entangled in their destructive power games.
 
The Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has a definite function in power: It
attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be
used strategically, with a definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on the
other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired by all.
And their generosity is so indiscriminate and needy that it may not have the
desired effect: If they give to one and all, why should the recipient feel
special? Attractive as it may seem to make an Indiscriminate Giver your
mark, in any involvement with this type you will often feel burdened by
their insatiable emotional needs.
THE MISER
A miser, to make sure of his property, sold all that he had and converted it
into a great lump of gold, which he hid in a hole in the ground, and went
continually to visit and inspect it. This roused the curiosity of one of his
workmen, who, suspecting that there was a treasure, when his master’s back
was turned, went to the spot, and stole it away. When the miser returned
and found the place empty, he wept and tore his hair. But a neighbor who
saw him in this extravagant grief, and learned the cause of it, said: “Fret
thyself no longer, but take a stone and put it in the same place, and think
that it is your lump of gold; for, as you never meant to use it. the one will do
you as much good as the other.”
The worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW
Transgression I
After Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan
Empire began to pour into Spain, and Spaniards of all classes started
dreaming of the instant riches to be had in the New World. The story soon
spread of an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would
ritually cover himself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth
transformed El Dorado, the “Golden Man,” into an empire called El
Dorado, wealthier than the Incan, where the streets were paved and the
buildings inlaid with gold. This elaboration of the story did not seem
implausible, for surely a chief who could afford to waste gold dust in a lake
must rule a golden empire. Soon Spaniards were searching for El Dorado all
over northern South America.
In February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in this venture, led by
Pizarro’s brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in their
armors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000
Indians to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas,
and close to 1,000 dogs. But the expedition was soon hit by torrential rain,
which rotted its gear and spoiled its food. Meanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro
questioned the Indians they met along the way, those who seemed to be
withholding information, or who had not even heard of the fabulous
kingdom, he would torture and feed to the dogs. Word of the Spaniards’
murderousness spread quickly among the Indians, who realized that the
only way to avoid Gonzalo’s wrath was to make up stories about El Dorado
and send him as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed the
leads the Indians gave them, then, they were only led farther into deep
jungle.
The explorers’ spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since shredded;
their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were torn to pieces,
forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had
either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the swine but the
hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they
could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a barge
was built out of rotting wood. But the journey down the treacherous Napo
River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the river’s edge, Gonzalo sent
scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He waited
and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had decided to
desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own.
The rain continued without end. Gonzalo’s men forgot about El Dorado;
they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a little over
a hundred men, from an expedition originally numbering in the thousands,
managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they seemed to
have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their bodies
covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizable. For over a year
and a half they had marched in an enormous circle, two thousand miles by
foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had yielded
nothing—no sign of El Dorado and no sign of gold. Interpretation
Even after Gonzalo Pizarro’s disaster, the Spaniards launched expedition
after expedition in search of El Dorado. And like Pizarro the conquistadors
would burn and loot villages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable
hardships, and get no closer to gold. The money they spent on such
expeditions cannot be calculated; yet despite the futility of the search, the
lure of the fantasy endured.
There is a popular saying in Japan that goes “Tada yori takai mono wa
nai,” meaning: “Nothing is more costly than something given free of
charge.”
THE UNSPOKEN WAY, MICHIHIRO MATSUMOTO, 1988
MONEY
Yusuf Ibn Jafar el-Amudi used to take sums of money, sometimes very large
ones, from those who came to study with him. A distinguished legalist
visiting him once said: “I am enchanted and impressed by your teachings,
and I am sure that you are directing your disciples in a proper manner. But
it is not in accordance with tradition to take money for knowledge. Besides,
the action is open to misinterpretation.” El-Amudi said: “I have never sold
any knowledge. There is no money on earth sufficient to pay for it. As for
misinterpretation, the abstaining from taking money will not prevent it, for
it will find some other object. Rather should you know that a man who takes
money may be greedy for money, or he may not. But a man who takes
nothing at all is under the gravest suspicion of robbing the disciple of his
soul. People who say, ‘I take nothing,’ may be found to take away the
volition of their victim.”
THE DERMIS PROBE, IDRIES SHAH, 1970
Not only did the search for El Dorado cost millions of lives—both Indian
and Spanish—it helped bring the ruin of the Spanish empire. Gold became
Spain’s obsession. The gold that did find its way back to Spain-and a lot did
—was reinvested in more expeditions, or in the purchase of luxuries, rather
than in agriculture or any other productive endeavor. Whole Spanish towns
were depopulated as their menfolk left to hunt gold. Farms fell into ruin,
and the army had no recruits for its European wars. By the end of the
seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by more than half of its
population; the city of Madrid had gone from a population of 400,000 to
150,000. With diminishing returns from its efforts over so many years,
Spain fell into a decline from which it never recovered.
Power requires self-discipline. The prospect of wealth, particularly easy,
sudden wealth, plays havoc with the emotions. The suddenly rich believe
that more is always possible. The free lunch, the money that will fall into
your lap, is just around the corner.
In this delusion the greedy neglect everything power really depends on:
self-control, the goodwill of others, and so on. Understand: With one
exception—death—no lasting change in fortune comes quickly. Sudden
wealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid. Never let lust for money
lure you out of the protective and enduring fortress of real power. Make
power your goal and money will find its way to you. Leave El Dorado for
suckers and fools.
Transgression II
In the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society than
the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having led successful
campaigns against the French, was considered Europe’s premier general and
strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering, had
established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler of
England in 1702. In 1704 the duke’s triumph at the Battle of Blenheim
made him the toast of England, and to honor him the queen awarded him a
large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a great
palace there. Calling his planned home the Palace of Blenheim, the duke
chose as his architect the young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renaissance man
who wrote plays as well as designed buildings. And so construction began,
in the summer of 1705, with much fanfare and great hopes.
Vanbrugh had a dramatist’s sense of architecture. His palace was to be a
monument to Marlborough’s brilliance and power, and was to include
artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical
touches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She
thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she
wanted the palace finished as soon as possible. The duchess tortured
Vanbrugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty
matters; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted
every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things
too, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711,
dismissed her from the court, ordering her to vacate her apartments at the
royal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position,
and also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture
down to the brass doorknobs.
THE MAN WHO LOVED MONEY BETTER THAN LIFE
In ancient times there was an old woodcutter who went to the mountain
almost every day to cut wood.
It was said that this old man was a miser who hoarded his silver until it
changed to gold, and that he cared more for gold than anything else in all
the world.
One day a wilderness tiger sprang at him and though he ran he could not
escape, and the tiger carried him off in its mouth.
The woodcutter’s son saw his father’s danger, and ran to save him if
possible. He carried a long knife, and as he could run faster than the tiger,
who had a man to carry, he soon overtook them.
His father was not much hurt, for the tiger held him by his clothes. When
the old woodcutter saw his son about to stab the tiger he called out in great
alarm: “Do not spoil the tiger’s skin! Do not spoil the tiger’s skin! If you
can kill him without cutting holes in his skin we can get many pieces of
silver for it. Kill him, but do not cut his body.” While the son was listening
to his father’s instructions the tiger suddenly dashed off into the forest,
carrying the old man where the son could not reach him, and he was soon
killed.
 
“CHINESE FABLE,” VARIOUS FABLES FROM VARIOUS PLACES,
DIANE DI PRIMA, ED., 1960
 
Over the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as the
funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess thought
Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every carload of stone and
bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of wainscot,
hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and surveyors.
Marlborough, old and weary, wanted nothing more than to settle into the
palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a swamp of
litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess suing the
architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling, the duke
died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim.
After Marlborough’s death, it became clear that he had a vast estate,
worth over £2 million—more than enough to pay for finishing the palace.
But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh’s wages as well
as the workmen’s, and finally had the architect dismissed. The man who
took his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Vanbrugh’s
designs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the
duchess, unable to set foot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the
romantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in
architecture, but had given its creator a twenty-year nightmare.
Interpretation
For the Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play sadistic power
games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With
Vanbrugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she
envied his power to create, to attain a fame outside her reach. She may not
have had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse him over
the pettiest details—to ruin his life.
This kind of sadism, however, bears an awful price. It made construction
that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a
relationship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply pained the duke
(who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim), created endless lawsuits,
and took years off Vanbrugh’s life. Finally, too, posterity had the last word:
Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever
remembered for her consummate cheapness.
The powerful must have grandeur of spirit—they can never reveal any
pettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either
grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a reputation for
generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial
details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their
resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the
work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them well. Your money
will buy their submission better than your displays of power.
THE STORY OF MOSES AND PHARAOH
It is written in the histories of the prophets that Moses was sent to Pharaoh
with many miracles, wonders and honors. Now the daily ration for
Pharaoh’s table was 4,000 sheep, 400 cows, 200 camels, and a
corresponding amount of chickens, fish, beverages, frie
