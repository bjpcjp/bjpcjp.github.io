# 48-formlessness

LAW 48
ASSUME FORMLESSNESS
JUDGMENT
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack.
Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable
and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed.
The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water;
never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.
In martial arts, it is important that strategy be unfathomable, that form be
concealed, and that movements be unexpected, so that preparedness against
them be impossible. What enables a good general to win without fail is
always having unfathomable wisdom and a modus operandi that leaves no
tracks. Only the formless cannot be affected. Sages hide in unfathomability,
so their feelings cannot be observed; they operate in formlessness, so their
lines cannot be crossed.
 
THE BOOK OF THE HUAINAN MASTERS, CHINA, SECOND
CENTURY B.C.
 
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
By the eighth century B.C., the city-states of Greece had grown so large and
prosperous that they had run out of land to support their expanding
populations. So they turned to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor,
Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however,
was landlocked and surrounded by mountains. Lacking access to the
Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a seafaring people; instead they
turned on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent conflicts
lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an immense area
that would provide enough land for their citizens. This solution to their
problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How could they
maintain and police their conquered territories? The subordinate peoples
they ruled now outnumbered them ten to one. Surely this horde would take
a horrible revenge on them.
Sparta’s solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war.
Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer than their neighbors. This
was the only way they could ensure their stability and survival.
When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his
mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and
underwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they
were allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year. They
studied none of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and permitted
only slaves to practice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The
only skills the Spartans taught were those of warfare. Children seen as
weaklings were left to die in a cavern in the mountains. No system of
money or trading was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed,
would sow selfishness and dissension, weakening their warrior discipline.
The only way a Spartan could earn a living was through agriculture, mostly
on state-owned lands, which slaves, called helots, would work for him.
The Spartans’ single-mindedness allowed them to forge the most
powerful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and fought
with incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could vanquish an
army ten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at
Thermopylae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the
enemy; it seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although the Spartans proved
themselves mighty warriors, they had no interest in creating an empire.
They only wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it
against invaders. Decades would pass without a single change in the system
that had succeeded so well in preserving Sparta’s status quo.
THE DOC WITH THE CROPPED EARS
“What crime have I committed that I should be thus mutilated by my own
master?” pensively exclaimed Jowler, a young mastiff. “Here’s a pretty
condition for a dog of my pretentions! How can I show my face among my
friends? Oh! king of beasts, or rather their tyrant, who would dare to treat
you thus?” His complaints were not unfounded, for that very morning his
master, despite the piercing shrieks of our young friend, had barbarously
cut off his long pendent ears. Jowler expected nothing less than to give up
the ghost. As he advanced in years, he perceived that he gained more than
he had lost by his mutilation; for, being naturally inclined to fight with
others, he would often have returned home with this part disfigured in a
hundred places. A quarrelsome dog always has his ears lacerated. The less
we leave others to lay hold of the better. When one has but one point to
defend, it should be protected for fear of accident. Take for example Master
Jowler, who, being armed with a spiked collar, and having about as much
ear as a bird, a wolf would be puzzled to know where to tackle him.
 
FABLES, JEAN DE LA FOMTAINE, 1621-1695
 
At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture,
another city-state was rising to equal prominence: Athens. Unlike Sparta,
Athens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes
of trade. The Athenians became great merchants; their currency, the famous
“owl coins,” spread throughout the Mediterranean. Unlike the rigid
Spartans, the Athenians responded to every problem with consummate
creativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and new
arts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their
power grew, they came to pose a threat to the defense-minded Spartans.
In 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta
for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but after many
twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The
Spartans now commanded an empire, and this time they could not stay in
their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians
would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been
fought for naught.
After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had
been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so
unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and
overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule what had been
Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the worst forms of
corruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of life
was slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And
Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive as
a cultural and economic center.
Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and weaker.
Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important battle with the
city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty nation collapsed,
never to recover.
Interpretation
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled
disaster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes
a dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making
it hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast-moving
predators. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swiftly and
unpredictably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.
In facing a serious problem—controlling superior numbers—Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the
environment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety.
They managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what
cost? They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a
constant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,
learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govern,
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military
machine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to
survive. But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or
system you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing.
In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it, but
the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity to go;
it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is inherently
chaotic. And in the long run, money made Athens the conqueror, by
infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its protective armor. In the
battle between the two systems, Athens was fluid and creative enough to
take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more rigid until it cracked.
This is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or
individuals. In the face of the world’s harshness and danger, organisms of
any kind develop protection—a coat of armor, a rigid system, a comforting
ritual. For the short term it may work, but for the long term it spells disaster.
People weighed down by a system and inflexible ways of doing things
cannot move fast, cannot sense or adapt to change. They lumber around
more and more slowly until they go the way of the brontosaurus. Learn to
move fast and adapt or you will be eaten.
The best way to avoid this fate is to assume formlessness. No predator
alive can attack what it cannot see.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When World War II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China in
1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by Chiang
Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese Communists,
their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost succeeded in 1935,
forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling retreat that had
greatly diminished their numbers. Although the Communists had recovered
somewhat during the war against Japan, it would not be difficult to defeat
them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the countryside, had
unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experience or training
beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important parts of China,
except areas of Manchuria, which they had managed to take after the
Japanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in Manchuria.
He would take over its major cities and from those bases would spread
through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists away.
Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.
In 1945 and ’46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily took
the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this critical
campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Nationalists
began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria’s most out-of-
the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist armies,
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a town
only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive and
formless.
One seductive and ultimately always fatal path has been the development of
protective armor. An organism can protect itself by concealment, by
swiftness in flight, by effective counterattack, by uniting for attack and
defense with other individuals of its species and also by encasing itself
within bony plates and spines.... Almost always the experiment of armor
failed. Creatures adopiing it tended to become unwieldy. They had to move
relatively slowly. Hence they were forced to live mainly on vegetable food;
and thus in general they were at a disadvantage as compared with foes
living on more rapidly “profitable” animal food: The repeated failure of
protective armor shows that, even at a somewhat low evolutionary level,
mind triumphed over mere matter. It is this sort of triumph which has been
supremely exemplified in Man.
SCIENTIFIC THEORY AND RELIGION, E. W. BARNES, 1933
The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face of
superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Communist
leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas Chiang had
studied warfare in the West and was a follower of the German military
writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others.
Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao’s attacks. After the
Nationalists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what
was generally considered Manchuria’s useless space, the Communists
started using that large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army
from one city to reinforce another, the Communists would encircle the
rescuing army. Chiang’s forces were slowly broken into smaller and smaller
units, isolated from one another, their lines of supply and communication
cut. The Nationalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not
move, what good was it?
A kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders
comfortably remote from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the
soldiers had fought the Communists in the mountains, and had come to fear
their elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and watched as their
fast-moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them from all sides.
There seemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the
soldiers’ spirits, bombarding them with propaganda to lower their morale
and pressure them to desert.
The Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their encircled and
isolated cities started collapsing even before being directly attacked; one
after another fell in quick succession. In November of 1948, the
Nationalists surrendered Manchuria to the Communists—a humiliating
blow to the technically superior Nationalist army, and one that proved
decisive in the war. By the following year the Communists controlled all of
China.
Interpretation
The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess
and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In comparison to go,
the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays
to withdraw, or to sacrifice your pieces, which must be concentrated at key
areas. Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361
intersections—nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and
white stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board’s
intersections, one at a time, wherever you like. Once all your stones (52 for
each side) are on the board, the object is to isolate the stones of your
opponent by encircling them.
THE HARE AND THE TREE
The sage neither seeks to follow the ways of the ancients nor establishes
any fixed standard for all times but examines the things of his age and then
prepares to deal with them. There was in Sung a man, who tilled a field in
which there stood the trunk of a tree. Once a hare, while running fast,
rushed against the trunk, broke its neck, and died. Thereupon the man cast
his plough aside and watched that tree, hoping that he would get another
hare. Yet he never caught another hare and was himself ridiculed by the
people of Sung. Now supposing somebody wanted to govern the people of
the present age with the policies of the early kings, he would be doing
exactly the same thing as that man who watched the tree.
 
HAN-FEI-TZU, CHINESE PHILOSOPHFR, THIRD CENTURY B.C.
 
A game of go—called wei-chi in China—can last up to three hundred
moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly;
the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the
harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to
control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate the
board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. With
mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encircle them.
The aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in chess, but to
induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented,
and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indirect until the
end of the game, when the winner can surround the opponent’s stones at an
accelerated pace.
Chinese military strategists have been influenced by go for centuries. Its
proverbs have been applied to war time and again; Mao Tse-tung was an
addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in his strategies. A key
wei-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of the board to your
advantage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot
fathom your movements in a simple linear way.
“Every Chinese,” Mao once wrote, “should consciously throw himself
into this war of a jigsaw pattern” against the Nationalists. Place your men in
a jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out
what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai-
shek, he assumes you are incompetent and fails to protect himself. And if he
concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a
sitting duck for encirclement. In the wei-chi way of war, you encircle the
enemy’s brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to
confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communists—an
apparent formlessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy.
Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the
kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought
indirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and
multidimensional, inhabiting a plane beyond time and space: the strategist’s
mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value movement over position.
Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves; unable
to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you. Instead
of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads out, just
as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world to your
advantage. Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to
attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with
your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your
enemies—by the time they figure out where you are and what you are up to,
it is too late.
When you want to fight us, we don’t let you and you can’t find us. But when 
we want to fight you, we make sure that you can’t get away and we hit you 
squarely ... and wipe you out.... The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy 
camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we
pursue.
Mao Tse-tung, 1893-1976
General Rommel surpassed Patton as a creative intellect.... Rommel
shunned military formalism. He made no fixed plans beyond those intended
for the initial clash; thereafter, he tailored his tactics to meet specific
situations as they arose. He was a lightning-fast decision-maker, physically
maintaining a pace that matched his active mentality. In a forbidding sea of
sand, he operated in a free environment. Once Rommel ruptured the British
lines in Africa, he had the whole northern part of the continent opened to
him. Comparatively free from the hamstringing authority of Berlin,
disregarding orders even from Hitler himself on occasion, Rommel
implemented one successful operation after another until he had most of
North Africa under his control and Cairo trembling at his feet.
THE ART OF WINNING WARS, JAMES MRAZEK, 1968
KEYS TO POWER
The human animal is distinguished by its constant creation of forms. Rarely
expressing its emotions directly, it gives them form through language, or
through socially acceptable rituals. We cannot communicate our emotions
without a form.
The forms that we create, however, change constantly—in fashion, in
style, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the moment.
We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previous
generations, and these changes are signs
