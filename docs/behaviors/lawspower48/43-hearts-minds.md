LAW 43
WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS
JUDGMENT
Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must
seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have
seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to
operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the
resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and
what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to
hate you.
CYRUS’S RUSE
Thinking of the means by which he could most effectively persuade the
Persians to revolt, [Cyrus’s] deliberations led him to adopt the following
plan, which he found best suited to his purpose. He wrote on a roll of
parchment that Astyages had appointed him to command the Persian army;
then he summoned an assembly of the Persians, opened the roll in their
presence and read out what he had written. “And now, he added, I have an
order for you: every man is to appear on parade with a billhook....” The
order was obeyed. All the men assembled with their billhooks, and Cyrus’s
next command was that before the day was out they should clear a certain
piece of rough land full of thorn-bushes, about eighteen or twenty furlongs
square. This too was done, whereupon Cyrus issued the further order that
they should present themselves again on the following day, after having
taken a bath. Meanwhile, Cyrus collected and slaughtered all his father’s
goats, sheep, and oxen in preparation for entertaining the whole Persian
army at a banquet, together with the best wine and bread he could procure.
The next day the guests assembled, and were told to sit down on the grass
and enjoy themselves. After the meal Cyrus asked them which they preferred
—yesterday’s work or today’s amusement; and they replied that it was
indeed a far cry from the previous day’s misery to their present pleasures.
This was the answer which Cyrus wanted; he seized upon it at once and
proceeded to lay bare what he had in mind. “Men of Persia,” he said,
“listen to me: obey my orders, and you will be able to enjoy a thousand
pleasures as good as this without ever turning your hands to menial labor;
but, if you disobey, yesterday’s task will be the pattern of innumerable
others you will be forced to perform. Take my advice and win your freedom.
I am the man destined to undertake your liberation, and it is my belief that
you are a match for the Medes in war as in everything else. It is the truth I
tell you. Do not delay, but fling off the yoke of Astyages at once.”
The Persians had long resented their subjection to the Medes. At last they
had found a leader, and welcomed with enthusiasm the prospect of liberty....
On the present occasion the Persians under Cyrus rose against the Medes
and from then onwards were masters of Asia.
THE HISTORIES, HERODOTUS, FIFTH CENTURY B.C..
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Near the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed desperate for
change. When the king’s grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis
XVI, married the fifteen-year-old daughter of the empress of Austria, the
French caught a glimpse of the future that seemed hopeful. The young
bride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and full of life. She instantly
changed the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV’s de
baucheries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked
excitedly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had grown disgusted with the
series of mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward
to serving their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode
through the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed
around her carriage. “How fortunate,” she wrote her mother, “to be in a
position in which one can gain widespread affection at so little cost.”
In 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as
Marie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures she
loved the most—ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and
jewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her
sculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing
a constant succession of masked balls and fêtes. All of these whims she paid
for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills.
Marie-Antoinette’s greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of a
private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a château on the grounds of
Versailles with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be
as “natural” as possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and
rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant
milkmaids to milk the finest-looking cows in the realm; launderers and
cheese-makers in special peasant outfits she helped design; shepherds to
tend sheep with silk ribbons around their necks. When she inspected the
barns, she would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases
made at the royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Marie-Antoinette would
gather flowers in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her “good
peasants” doing their “chores.” The place became a separate world, its
community limited to her chosen favorites.
With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared.
Meanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and
widespread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with
resentment—the queen treated them like children. Only her favorites
mattered, and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie-Antoinette
did not concern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she
read a minister’s report. Not once did she tour the provinces and rally the
people to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive
a delegation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she
felt the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love
them in return.
In 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elaborate
swindle, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been
purchased under her name, and during the swindlers’ trial her lavish
lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels
and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname “Madame
Deficit,” and from then on she became the focus of the people’s growing
resentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience greeted
her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she had been
running up her huge expenditures, the country was headed for ruin.
Five years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the
beginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry—let the
people have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet
down and she would be able to resume her life of pleasure. That year the
people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace
and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for the rebels, but it offered
the queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and establish
contact with the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson:
Not once would she leave the palace during her stay in Paris. Her subjects
could rot in hell for all she cared.
In 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison, as the
revolution officially declared the end of the monarchy. The following year
Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As Marie-Antoinette
awaited the same fate, hardly a soul came to her defense—not one of her
former friends in the court, not one of Europe’s other monarchs (who, as
members of their own countries’ royal families, had all the reason in the
world to show that revolution did not pay), not even her own family in
Austria, including her brother, who now sat on the throne. She had become
the world’s pariah. In October of 1793, she finally knelt at the guillotine,
unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end.
Interpretation
From early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes:
As a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered and cajoled. As
the future queen of the French court she was the center of everyone’s
attention. She never learned to charm or please other people, to become
attuned to their individual psychologies. She never had to work to get her
way, to use calculation or cunning or the arts of persuasion. And like
everyone who is indulged from an early age, she evolved into a monster of
insensitivity.
Marie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country’s dissatisfaction
because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort to
seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of
deception. And do not imagine that she represents a bygone era, or that she
is even rare. Her type is today more common than ever. Such types live in
their own bubble—they seem to feel they are born kings and queens, and
that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone else’s nature, but
bulldoze over people with the self-righteous arrogance of a Marie-
Antoinette. Pampered and indulged as children, as adults they still believe
that everything must come to them; convinced of their own charm, they
make no effort to charm, seduce, or gently persuade.
In the realm of power, such attitudes are disastrous. At all times you must
attend to those around you, gauging their particular psychology, tailoring
your words to what you know will entice and seduce them. This requires
energy and art. The higher your station, the greater the need to remain
attuned to the hearts and minds of those below you, creating a base of
support to maintain you at the pinnacle. Without that base, your power will
teeter, and at the slightest change of fortune those below will gladly assist in
your fall from grace.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to the ruler
of Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situation. The kingdom of
Wei had mounted an all-out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous
still, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of
Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second
menace from the south before he could hope to fend off Wei in the north.
As Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a wise
man in his camp offered him advice. It would be impossible, this man said,
to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat Menghuo, but as
soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would reinvade.
“It is better to win hearts,” said the wise man, “than cities; better to battle
with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning the
hearts of these people.” “You read my thoughts,” responded Chuko Liang.
THE GENTLE ART OF PERSUASION
The north wind and the sun were disputing which was the stronger, and
agreed to acknowledge as the victor whichever of them could strip a
traveler of his clothing. The wind tried first. But its violent gusts only made
the man hold his clothes tightly around him, and when it blew harder still
the cold made him so uncomfortable that he put on an extra wrap.
Eventually the wind got tired of it and handed him over to the sun. The sun
shone first with a moderate warmth, which made the man take off his
topcoat. Then it blazed fiercely, till, unable to stand the heat, he stripped
and went off to bathe in a nearby river. Persuasion is more effective than
force.
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
As Liang expected, Menghuo launched a powerful attack. But Liang laid
a trap and managed to capture a large part of Menghuo’s army, including
the king himself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, however,
he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed,
regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. “You are all
upright men,” he said. “I believe you all have parents, wives, and children
waiting for you at home. They are doubtless shedding bitter tears at your
fate. I am going to release you, so that you can return home to your loved
ones and comfort them.” The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes;
then he sent for Menghuo. “If I release you,” asked Liang, “what will you
do?” “I will pull my army together again,” answered the king, “and lead it
against you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will
bow to your superiority.” Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he
gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered
why he did this, Liang told them, “I can capture that man as easily as I can
take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do,
peace will come of itself here in the south.”
As Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own officers,
whom Liang had treated so well, rebelled against him, captured him, and
turned him over to Liang, who asked him again the same question as before.
Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but merely betrayed by
his own officers; he would fight again, but if captured a third time he would
bow to Liang’s superiority.
Over the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and again,
capturing him a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion
Menghuo’s troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated them with
respect; they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang
asked Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another
excuse: You tricked me, I lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture
me again, he would promise, I swear I will not betray you. And so Liang
would let him go.
When he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the
same question again. “If you capture me a seventh time,” the king replied,
“I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.” “Very well,” said
Liang. “But if I capture you again, I will not release you.”
Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their kingdom, the
region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope left:
He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge, who had an immense and
ferocious army. Wutugu’s warriors wore an armor of tightly woven vines
soaked in oil, then dried to an impenetrable hardness. With Menghuo at his
side, Wutugu marched this mighty army against Liang, and this time the
great strategist seemed frightened, leading his men in a hurried retreat. But
he was merely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered the king’s men in a
narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When the fires reached the
soldiers Wutugu’s whole army burst into flame—the oil in their armor, of
course, being highly flammable. All of them perished.
Liang had managed to separate Menghuo and his entourage from the
carnage in the valley, and the king found himself a captive for the seventh
time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again. He
sent a messenger to the captured king: “He has commissioned me to release
you. Mobilize another army against him, if you can, and try once more to
defeat him.” Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang on his
hands and knees, and prostrated himself at his feet. “Oh great minister,”
cried Menghuo, “yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south will
never again offer resistance to your rule.” “Do you now yield?” asked
Liang. “I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor’s
boundless, life-giving mercy. How could we not yield?”
Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him on the
throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north with his
army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back—he had no need
to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally.
The men who have changed the universe have never gotten there by
working on leaders, but rather by moving the masses. Working on leaders is
the method of intrigue and only leads to secondary results. Working on the
masses, however, is the stroke of genius that changes the face of the world.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821
LIFE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT
This long and painful pursuit of Darius—for in eleven days he marched 33
hundred furlongs—harassed his soldiers so that most of them were ready to
give it up, chiefly for want of water. While they were in this distress, it
happened that some Macedonians who had fetched water in skins upon
their mules from a river they had found out came about noon to the place
where Alexander was, and seeing him almost choked with thirst, presently
filled a helmet and offered it him.... Then he took the helmet into his hands,
and looking round about, when he saw all those who were near him
stretching their heads out and looking earnestly after the drink, he returned
it again with thanks without tasting a drop of it. “For,” said he, “if I alone
should drink, the rest will be out of heart.” The soldiers no sooner took
notice of his temperance and magnanimity upon this occasion, but they one
and all cried out to him to lead them forward boldly, and began whipping
on their horses. For whilst they had such a king they said they defied both
weariness and thirst, and looked upon themselves to be little less than
immortal.

Interpretation
Chuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the south with
one crushing blow, or patiently and slowly win them to his side over time.
Most people more powerful than their enemy grab the first option and never
consider the second, but the truly powerful think far ahead: The first option
may be quick and easy, but over time it brews ugly emotions in the hearts of
the vanquished. Their resentment turns to hatred; such animosity keeps you
on edge—you spend your energy protecting what you have gained, growing
paranoid and defensive. The second option, though more difficult, not only
brings you peace of mind, it converts a potential enemy into a pillar of
support.
In all your encounters, take a step back—take the time to calculate and
attune yourself to your targets’ emotional makeup and psychological
weaknesses. Force will only strengthen their resistance. With most people
the heart is the key: They are like children, ruled by their emotions. To
soften them up, alternate harshness with mercy. Play on their basic fears,
and also their loves—freedom, family, etc. Once you break them down, you
will have a lifelong friend and fiercely loyal ally.
Governments saw men only in mass; but our men, being irregulars, were
not 
formations, but individuals.... Our kingdoms lay in each man’s mind.
Seven Pillars of Wisdom, T. E. Lawrence, 1888-1935
KEYS TO POWER
In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely
no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have
nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to make them hostile, for
they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their
time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find
the key that unlocks the stranger’s heart and mind, seducing him into their
corner, if necessary softening him up for a punch. But most people never
learn this side of the game. When they meet someone new, rather than
stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk
about themselves, eager to impose their own willpower and prejudices.
They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it
but they are secretly creating an enemy, a resister, because there is no more
infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own
psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.
Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and breaking
them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work on
their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to both
what s
