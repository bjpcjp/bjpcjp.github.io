LAW 20
DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE
JUDGMENT
It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or
cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the
master of others—playing people against one another, making them pursue
you.
PART I: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE, BUT BE COURTED BY
ALL
If you allow people to feel they possess you to any degree, you lose all
power over them. By not committing your affections, they will only try
harder to win you over. Stay aloof and you gain the power that comes from
their attention and frustrated desire. Play the Virgin Queen: Give them hope
but never satisfaction.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there was
much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in
Parliament, and was a main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all
classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone
thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a king,
and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years.
Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the realm—Sir
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh—vied for Elizabeth’s
hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and
her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each
other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to marry
before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did she
discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless.
The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made her
the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of cultish
worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe his
dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other
goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser and others wrote eulogies to the
Virgin Queen. She was referred to as “the world’s Empresse,” “that virtuous
Virgo” who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation
with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a dare
that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did all she could to stir their interest
and simultaneously keep them at bay.
Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with
Elizabeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king
of Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of
Austria. She politely refused them all.
The great diplomatic issue of Elizabeth’s day was posed by the revolt of
the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain.
Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main
ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch
independence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France
would be England’s wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble
blood, the dukes of Anjou and Alençon, brothers of the French king. Would
either of them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept
the hopes of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou
made several visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her
by pet names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as she
flirted with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between
France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break off the
courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herself to be courted
by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she found
physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was secure,
she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could.
By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accordingly
able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Virgin Queen.
She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of incomparable peace and
cultural fertility.
Interpretation
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of
Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being ruled by a
woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry wisely. To wed a
foreigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would
open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Darnley, a Catholic.
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland’s Protestants, and endless
turmoil ensued.
Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ruler’s undoing:
By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation, the
queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, conflicts
which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war. Also, the
husband becomes the de facto ruler, and often tries to do away with his wife
the queen, as Darnley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth learned the lesson
well. She had two goals as a ruler: to avoid marriage and to avoid war. She
managed to combine these goals by dangling the possibility of marriage in
order to forge alliances. The moment she committed to any single suitor
would have been the moment she lost her power. She had to emanate
mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone’s hopes but never
yielding.
Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the
center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence above all,
Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.
I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.
Queen Elizabeth I, 1533-1603
KEYS TO POWER
Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the tricks that
will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is one of
these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind of
respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself
ungraspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as
most people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your
reputation for independence grows, more and more people will come to
desire you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a
virus: If we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this
person desirable too.
The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like everyone
else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to
commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you
under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do
not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be
careful to maintain your inner aloofness. You cannot inadvertently allow
yourself to feel obligated to anyone.
Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem
that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen, you need to
stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.
You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then—but never too far.
The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to
perfection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian
armada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious Athenians back home
tried to bring him down by accusing him of trumped-up charges, he
defected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back home.
Then, after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for
Persia, even though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now,
however, both the Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because
of his influence with the Persians; and the Persians showered him with
honors because of his power over the Athenians and the Spartans. He made
promises to every side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the
cards.
If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put
yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the
promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy,
will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention, you will
immediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power
will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect
this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional
entanglements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the
top. You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.
In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger made
a phone call to Richard Nixon’s team. Kissinger had been allied with
Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican
nomination. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable
inside information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then
going on in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping him
informed of the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his
offer.
At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic
nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people
asked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. “Look,”
Kissinger told Humphrey’s people, “I’ve hated Nixon for years.” In fact he
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the
promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey.
Whichever man won the election, Kissinger’s career was secure.
The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon
man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to him than
Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By
maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times.
Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon: People
who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the process,
for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back find
themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and
everyone wants them on their side.
When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most
successful artist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer or
that dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with attractive
offers and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their
services; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over him his
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted
to reach detente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or
conciliatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also
scared the Soviets—they were already politically isolated and feared further
isolation if the United States and China came together. Kissinger’s move
pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction:
When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.
Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.
Image: 
The Virgin Queen. 
The center of attention, 
desire, and worship. Never 
succumbing to one suitor or the 
other, the Virgin Queen keeps 
them all revolving around 
her like planets, unable to 
leave her orbit but never 
getting any closer 
to her.
Authority: Do not commit yourself to anybody or anything, for that is to be
a slave, a slave to every man.... Above all, keep yourself free of
commitments and obligations—they are the device of another to get you
into his power.... (Baltasar Gracián, 1601-1658)
PART II: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE-STAY ABOVE
THE FRAY
Do not let people drag you into their petty fights and squabbles. Seem
interested and supportive, but find a way to remain neutral; let others do
the fighting while you stand back, watch and wait. When the fighting parties
are good and tired they will be ripe for the picking. You can make it a
practice, in fact, to stir up quarrels between other people, and then offer to
mediate, gaining power as the go-between.
THE KITES, THE CROWS, AND THE FOX
The kites and the crows made an agreement among themselves that they
should go halves in everything obtained in the forest. One day they saw a
fox that had been wounded by hunters lying helpless under a tree, and
gathered round it. The crows said, “We will take the upper half of the fox.”
“Then we will take the lower half,” said the kites. The fox laughed at this,
and said, “I always thought the kites were superior in creation to the crows;
as such they must get the upper half of my body, of which my head, with the
brain and other delicate things in it, forms a portion. ” “Oh, yes, that is
right,” said the kites, “we will have that part of the fox.” “Not at all,” said
the crows, “we must have it, as already agreed.” Then a war arose between
the rival parties, and a great many fell on both sides, and the remaining few
escaped with difficulty. The fox continued there for some days, leisurely
feeding on the dead kites and crows, and then left the place hale and hearty,
observing, The weak benefit by the quarrels of the mighty . ”
INDIAN FABLES
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city-states in Italy—Venice,
Florence, Rome, and Milan—found themselves constantly squabbling.
Hovering above their struggles were the nations of France and Spain, ready
to grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped
in the middle was the small state of Mantua, ruled by the young Duke
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern Italy,
and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swallowed it
up and it ceased to exist as an independent kingdom.
Gonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of troops, and he
became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid him best. In the
year 1490, he married Isabella d’Este, daughter of the ruler of another small
Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away from
Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead.
Isabella’s first true test as ruler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of
France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious
fashion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from
Milan’s difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby
giving the French carte blanche. The Venetians signaled that they would not
help Milan, either—and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would
give them Mantua. The ruler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found
himself alone and abandoned. He turned to Isabella d’Este, one of his
closest friends (also rumored to be his lover), and begged her to persuade
Duke Gonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for
he saw Sforza’s cause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down
on Milan and took it with ease.
Isabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the
French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with
France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Mantua
once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Venice or Rome for
help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the cloak of coming to
her aid. Yet she had to do something. The mighty king of France was
breathing down her neck: She decided to befriend him, as she had
befriended Lodovico Sforza before him—with alluring gifts, witty,
intelligent letters, and the possibility of her company, for Isabella was
famous as a woman of incomparable beauty and charm.
In 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his
victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the affair:
When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of
French royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses (she
had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and just as
she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all the other
ladies vying for his attention. She soon became his constant companion, and
in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua’s independence
from Venice.
Men of great abilities are slow to act. for it is easier to avoid occasions for
committing yourself than to come well out of a commitment. Such occasions
test your judgment; it is safer to avoid them than to emerge victorious from
them. One obligation leads to a greater one, and you come very near to the
brink of disaster.
BALTASAR GRACIÁN, 1601-1658
As one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose, this
time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting in 1500, Borgia
had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small kingdoms in his
path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella understood Cesare
perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way offended. He had to be
cajoled and kept at arm’s length. Isabella began by sending him gifts—
falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks, which she knew he
always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She sent messengers with
flattering greetings (although these messengers also acted as her spies). At
one point Cesare asked if he could house some troops in Mantua; Isabella
managed to dissuade him politely, knowing full well that once the troops
were quartered in the city, they would never leave.
Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone
around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about him, since he had
spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion. When
Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even dangled
in front of him the possibility of a marriage between her family and his.
Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized everything in his
path, he spared Mantua.
In 1503 Cesare’s father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new
pope, Julius II, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When the
ruler of Ferrara—Alfonso, Isabella’s brother—sided with the French, Julius
decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella found herself in the
middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the other. She
dared not ally herself with either, but to offend either would be equally
disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had become so
expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for the pope,
knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let French troops
pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara’s aid. While she publicly
complained that the French had “invaded” her territory, she privately
supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion plausible to
Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It worked once
again: The pope left Mantua alone.
In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French
troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later.
With his death, the nightmarish cycle of battles and petty squabbles began
to repeat itself.
A great deal changed in Italy during Isabella’s reign: Popes came and
went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire, Milan was
invaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked by the Hapsburg
Emperor Charles V Through all this, tiny Mantua not only survived but
thrived, its court the envy of Italy. Its wealth and sovereignty would remain
intact for a century after Isabella’s death, in 1539.
