ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First I would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this
book, and whose invaluable insights played a critical role in the shape and
content of The 48 Laws. Without her, none of this would have been
possible.
I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible
for involving me in the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there
to Joost Elffers, my partner and producer of The 48 Laws of Power. It was
in the scheming world of Fabrika that Joost and I saw the timeless-ness of
Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice, Italy, this book was born.
I would like to thank Henri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many
Machiavellian anecdotes over the years, particularly concerning the
numerous French characters who play such a large role in this book.
I would also like to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their
library on Japanese history and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony
part of the book. Similarly, I must thank my good friend Elizabeth Yang
who advised me on Chinese history.
A book like this depended greatly on the research material available and I
am particularly grateful to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many
pleasant days wandering through its incomparable collections.
My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, deserve endless thanks for their
patience and support.
And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me
company throughout the never-ending days of writing.
Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game
of power to manipulate, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear
you no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with inspiration for The
48 Laws of Power.

SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY

PREFACE
The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally
unbearable to us—when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants
less power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is
dangerous to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves.
We have to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle—congenial yet
cunning, democratic yet devious.
This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic that
existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout
history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power—king,
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an
especially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they
seemed to fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers
around them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the
master’s favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilled courtiers capable of
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers, who
at all moments were scheming to push them aside.
Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civilization
and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon; courtiers
would work silently and secretly against any among them who used force.
This was the courtier’s dilemma: While appearing the very paragon of
elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in the subtlest
of ways. The successful courtier learned over time to make all of his moves
indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a velvet glove on
his hand and the sweetest of smiles on his face. Instead of using coercion or
outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way through seduction,
charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning several moves
ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that required constant
vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.
Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier:
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance
diplomat and courtier Niccolò Machiavelli wrote, “Any man who tries to be
good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are
not good.” The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but
underneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions—greed, envy,
lust, hatred—boiled and simmered. Our world today similarly imagines
itself the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us,
as they have forever. The game is the same. Outwardly, you must seem to
respect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly to
be prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside a
velvet glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts
of indirection, learning to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver
your opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to
make people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done.
And if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent nor
resist you.
Courts are, unquestionably, the seats of politeness and good breeding; were
they not so, they would be the seats of slaughter and desolation. Those who
now smile upon and embrace, would affront and stab, each other, if
manners did not interpose....
LORD CHESTERFIELD, 1694-1773
To some people the notion of consciously playing power games—no matter
how indirect—seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they can
opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with
power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such
opinions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power.
They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation
involved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and
lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without any
motive of self-interest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympathy
or respect. Making a show of one’s weakness is actually a very effective
strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the
Surrender Tactic).
There is nothing very odd about lambs disliking birds of prey, but this is no
reason for holding it against large birds of prey that they carry off lambs.
And when the lambs whisper among themselves, “These birds of prey are
evil, and does this not give us a right to say that whatever is the opposite of
a bird of prey must be good?” there is nothing intrinsically wrong with such
an argument—though the birds of prey will look somewhat quizzically and
say, “We have nothing against these good lambs; in fact, we love them;
nothing tastes better than a tender lamb.”
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1844-1900
Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in
every area of life. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and
strength. But if, to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone
equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do
certain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring
their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who
excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying
another power strategy, redistributing people’s rewards in a way that they
determine.
Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and
straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek
power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt
and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in
return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and
free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use of
honesty is indeed a power strategy, intended to convince people of one’s
noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a
subtle form of coercion.
Finally, those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of naïveté, to
protect them from the accusation that they are after power. Beware again,
however, for the appearance of naivete can be an effective means of deceit
(see Law 21, Seem Dumber Than Your Mark). And even genuine naivete is
not free of the snares of power. Children may be naive in many ways, but
they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those around
them. Children suffer greatly from feeling powerless in the adult world, and
they use any means available to get their way. Genuinely innocent people
may still be playing for power, and are often horribly effective at the game,
since they are not hindered by reflection. Once again, those who make a
show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all.
The only means to gain one’s ends with people are force and cunning. Love
also, they say; but that is to wait for sunshine, and life needs every moment.
JOHANN VON GOETHE, 1749-1832
You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt
their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since
all of us hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at
gaining it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in our eyes, distracting
us from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe
them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at
indirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And
they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day.
The arrow shot by the archer may or may not kill a single person. But
stratagems devised by a wise man can kill even babes in the womb.
KAUTILYA, INDIAN PHILOSOPHER, THIRD CENTURY B.C.
If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it,
there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you
powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of
struggling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling
guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing
with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you become.
