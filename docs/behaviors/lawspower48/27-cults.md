LAW 27
PLAY ON PEOPLE’S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A
CULTLIKE FOLLOWING
JUDGMENT
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the
focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow.
Keep your words vague but full of promise ; emphasize enthusiasm over
rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform,
ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized
religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold
power.
THE SCIENCE OF CHARLATANISM, OR HOW TO
CREATE A CULT IN FIVE EASY STEPS
In searching, as you must, for the methods that will gain you the most
power for the least effort, you will find the creation of a cultlike following
one of the most effective. Having a large following opens up all sorts of
possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they
will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of
enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you
to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to
enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong.
You might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following, but in
fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to believe in
something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot
endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that comes from a lack of
something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get-
rich-quick scheme, or the latest technological trend or art movement and we
leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at history: The chronicles
of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for themselves
could fill a library. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years, a few
months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so
attractive, so transcendental, so divine.
Always in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints and
faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make yourself
the object of worship. Make people form a cult around you.
The great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time of
transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, science on the rise.
People were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith. The charlatans
had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemic shortcuts to wealth.
Moving quickly from town to town, they originally focused on small groups
—until, by accident, they stumbled on a truth of human nature: The larger
the group they gathered around themselves, the easier it was to deceive.
The charlatan would station himself on a high wooden platform (hence
the term “mountebank”) and crowds would swarm around him. In a group
setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason. Had the charlatan
spoken to them individually, they might have found him ridiculous, but lost
in a crowd they got caught up in a communal mood of rapt attention. It
became impossible for them to find the distance to be skeptical. Any
deficiencies in the charlatan’s ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass.
Passion and enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they
reacted violently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both
consciously studying this dynamic over decades of experiment and
spontaneously adapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans
perfected the science of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd
into followers and the followers into a cult.
It was to the charlatan’s advantage that the individuals predisposed to
credulity should multiply, that the groups of his adherents should enlarge to
mass proportions, guaranteeing an ever greater scope for his triumphs. And
this was in fact to occur, as science was popularized, from the Renaissance
on down through succeeding centuries. With the immense growth of
knowledge and its spread through printing in modern times, the mass of the
half educated, the eagerly gullible prey of the quack, also increased,
became indeed a majority; real power could be based on their wishes,
opinions, preferences, and rejections. The charlatan’s empire accordingly
widened with the modern dissemination of knowledge; since he operated on
the basis of science, however much he perverted it, producing gold with a
technique borrowed from chemistry and his wonderful balsams with the
apparatus of medicine, he could not appeal to an entirely ignorant folk. The
illiterate would be protected against his absurdities by their healthy
common sense. His choicest audience would be composed of the
semiliterate, those who had exchanged their common sense for a little
distorted information and had encountered science and education at some
time, though briefly and unsuccessfully.... The great mass of mankind has
always been predisposed to marvel at mysteries, and this was especially
true at certain historic periods when the secure foundations of life seemed
shaken and old values, economic or spiritual, long accepted as certainties,
could no longer be relied upon. Then the numbers of the charlatan’s dupes
multiplied—the “self killers,” as a seventeenth-century Englishman called
them.
 
THE POWER OF THE CHARLATAN, GRETE DE FRANCESCO, 1939
 
The gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are
thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-true
methods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing the names
of their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We find these latter-
day charlatans in all arenas of life—business, fashion, politics, art. Many of
them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any
knowledge of its history, but you can be more systematic and deliberate.
Simply follow the five steps of cultmaking that our charlatan ancestors
perfected over the years.
 
Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first
attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too clear
and readable, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your initial
speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements: on the
one hand the promise of something great and transformative, and on the
other a total vagueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of hazy
dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and see what
they want to see.
To make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance but
cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy titles for simple
things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words
for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of specialized
knowledge, giving you a veneer of profundity. By the same token, try to
make the subject of your cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it.
Done right, the combination of vague promises, cloudy but alluring
concepts, and fiery enthusiasm will stir people’s souls and a group will form
around you.
Talk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous to
be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by
following your cult, you will be expected to satisfy them.
As a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple. Most
people’s problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis,
interconnected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are
exceedingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with
this; most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their
problems. The ability to offer this kind of solution will give you great
power and build you a following. Instead of the complicated explanations of
real life, return to the primitive solutions of our ancestors, to good old
country remedies, to mysterious panaceas.
 
Step 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual.
Once people have begun to gather around you, two dangers will present
themselves: boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make people go
elsewhere ; skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about
whatever it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully
created and revealing your ideas for what they are. You need to amuse the
bored, then, and ward off the cynics.
THE OWL WHO WAS GOD
Once upon a starless midnight there was an owl who sat on the branch of
an oak tree. Two ground moles tried to slip quietly by, unnoticed. “You!”
said the owl. “Who?” they quavered, in fear and astonishment, for they
could not believe it was possible for anyone to see them in that thick
darkness. “You two!” said the owl. The moles hurried away and told the
other creatures of the field and forest that the owl was the greatest and
wisest of all animals because he could see in the dark and because he could
answer any question. “I’ll see about that,” said a secretary bird, and he
called on the owl one night when it was again very dark. “How many claws
am I holding up?” said the secretary bird. “Two,” said the owl, and that
was right. “Can you give me another expression for ‘that is to say’ or
‘namely?’ ” asked the secretary bird. “To wit,” said the owl. “Why does a
lover call on his love?” asked the secretary bird. “To woo,” said the owl.
The secretary bird hastened back to the other creatures and reported that
the owl was indeed the greatest and wisest animal in the world because he
could see in the dark and because he could answer any question.
“Can he see in the daytime, too?” asked a red fox. “Yes,” echoed a
dormouse and a French poodle. “Can he see in the daytime, too?” All the
other creatures laughed loudly at this silly question, and they set upon the
red fox and his friends and drove them out of the region. Then they sent a
messenger to the owl and asked him to be their leader. When the owl
appeared among the animals it was high noon and the sun was shining
brightly. He walked very slowly, which gave him an appearance of great
dignity, and he peered about him with large, staring eyes, which gave him
an air of tremendous importance. “He’s God!” screamed a Plymouth Rock
hen. And the others took up the cry “He’s God!” So they followed him
wherever he went and when he began to bump into things they began to
bump into things. too. Finally he came to a concrete highway and he started
up the middle of it and all the other creatures followed him. Presently a
hawk, who was acting as outrider, observed a truck coming toward them at
fifty miles an hour, and he reported to the secretary bird and the secretary
bird reported to the owl. “There’s danger ahead, ” said the secretary bird.
“To wit?” said the owl. The secretary bird told him. “Aren’t you afraid?”
He asked. “Who?” said the owl calmly, for he could not see the truck.
“He’s God!” cried all the creatures again, and they were still crying “He’s
God!” when the truck hit them and ran them down. Some of the animals
were merely injured, but most of them, including the owl, were killed.
Moral: You can fool too many of the people too much of the time.
THE THURBER CARNIVAL, JAMES THURBER, 1894-1961
The best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its kind.
Surround yourself with luxury, dazzle your followers with visual splendor,
fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them from seeing the
ridiculousness of your ideas, the holes in your belief system, it will also
attract more attention, more followers. Appeal to all the senses: Use incense
for scent, soothing music for hearing, colorful charts and graphs for the eye.
You might even tickle the mind, perhaps by using new technological
gadgets to give your cult a pseudo-scientific veneer—as long as you do not
make anyone really think. Use the exotic—distant cultures, strange customs
—to create theatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary
affairs seem signs of something extraordinary.
 
Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the
Group. Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a
way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held
unquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so
in our supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded
some, its forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of
organized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for your
followers; organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of
sanctity, and giving them names and titles that resound with religious
overtones; ask them for sacrifices that will fill your coffers and increase
your power. To emphasize your gathering’s quasi-religious nature, talk and
act like a prophet. You are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a
sage, a shaman, or any other word that hides your real power in the mist of
religion.
 
Step 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. Your group has grown, and you
have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are beginning to fill
with your followers’ money. Yet you must never be seen as hungry for
money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise
the source of your income.
Your followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good
things will fall into their lap. By surrounding yourself with luxury you
become living proof of the soundness of your belief system. Never reveal
that your wealth actually comes from your followers’ pockets; instead,
make it seem to come from the truth of your methods. Followers will copy
your each and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same
results, and their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan
nature of your wealth.
 
Step 5: Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. The group is now large and
thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not careful,
though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize the
group. To keep your followers united, you must now do what all religions
and belief systems have done: create an us-versus-them dynamic.
First, make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive club,
unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond,
manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a force
of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who tries to
reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be described as a
member of this devious force.
If you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react against,
your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to believe in
and infidels to destroy.
OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW
Observance I
In the year 1653, a twenty-seven-year-old Milan man named Francesco
Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling
one and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to him and announced
that he had been chosen to be the capitano generale of the Army of the
New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world. The archangel
had further revealed that Borri now had the power to see people’s souls, and
that he would soon discover the philosopher’s stone—a long-sought-after
substance that could change base metals into gold. Friends and
acquaintances who heard Borri explain the vision, and who witnessed the
change that had come over him, were impressed, for Borri had previously
devoted himself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. Now he gave all
that up, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and talking only of
mysticism and the occult.
The transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri’s words
were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following.
Unfortunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice him as well—they
prosecuted anyone who delved into the occult—so he left Italy and began to
wander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and all that “to those
who follow me all joy shall be granted.” Wherever Borri stayed he attracted
followers. His method was simple: He spoke of his vision, which had grown
more and more elaborate, and offered to “look into” the soul of anyone who
believed him (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he would stare
at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have seen the
person’s soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual greatness.
If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his growing
order of disciples, an honor indeed.
The cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned
according to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total
devotion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri—whom
they called “His Excellency,” and “Universal Doctor”—demanded from
them the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they
possessed had to be turned over to him. But they did not mind handing over
their property, for Borri had told them, “I shall soon bring my chemical
studies to a happy conclusion by the discovery of the philosopher’s stone,
and by this means we shall all have as much gold as we desire.”
Given his growing wealth, Borri began to change his style of living.
Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he had
temporarily settled, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and
accessories, which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the city
in a coach studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its
head. He never stayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared,
saying he had more souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew
in his absence. He became famous, although in fact he had never done a
single concrete thing.
To become the founder of a new religion one must be psychologically
infallible in one’s knowledge of a certain average type of souls who have
not yet recognized that they belong together.
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, 1844-1900
Men are so simple of mind, and so much dominated by their immediate
needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty who are ready to be
deceived.
 NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI, 1469-1527
From all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came to
visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers. He asked no fee
for his services, which only made him seem more marvelous, and indeed
some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle cure. By
only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people’s imaginations
to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for example, actually
came from the vast sums he was collecting from his increasingly select
group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in fact perfected the
philosopher’s stone. The Church continued to pursue him, denouncing him
for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri’s response to these charges was a
dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and made his followers
more passionate. Only the great are persecuted, after all; how many
understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Borri did not have to say a word—
his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist.
And so Borri’s power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of
Amsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums
of borrowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to him. (He
claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power of
his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually caught
up with him, and for the last twenty years of his life he was imprisoned in
Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his dying day
he was visited by wealthy believers, including Queen Christina of Sweden.
Supplying him with money and materials, these visitors allowed him to
continue his search for the elusive philosopher’s stone. Interpretation
