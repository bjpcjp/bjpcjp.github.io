LAW 3
CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS
JUDGMENT
Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose
behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot
prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop
them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will
be too late.
PART I: USE DECOYED OBJECTS OF DESIRE AND RED
HERRINGS TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT
If at any point in the deception you practice people have the slightest
suspicion as to your intentions, all is lost. Do not give them the chance to
sense what you are up to: Throw them off the scent by dragging red
herrings across the path. Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, set up
misleading objects of desire. Unable to distinguish the genuine from the
false, they cannot pick out your real goal.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of
seventeenth-century France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigné
explained his struggles in pursuing a beautiful but difficult young countess.
Ninon was sixty-two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, but
hopelessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the
marquis talk about his mistakes, but finally she had had enough. Unable to
bear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided
to take the young man under her wing. First, he had to understand that this
was war, and that the beautiful countess was a citadel to which he had to lay
siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and executed
with the utmost attention to detail and nuance.
Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the
countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the two
were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as would a
friend but not a potential lover. This was to throw her off the scent. The
countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted—perhaps he
was only interested in friendship.
Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would be time
to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fête in Paris, the
marquis would show up with a beautiful young woman at his side. This
beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so that wherever the
countess would now see the marquis, he would be surrounded by the most
stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess be seething
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was
desired by others. It was hard for Ninon to make the marquis understand,
but she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants
to see that other women are interested in him, too. Not only does that give
him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from
their clutches.
Once the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to beguile
her. On Ninon’s instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at affairs
where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would appear at
salons he had never frequented before, but that the countess attended often.
She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would push her into
the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for successful
seduction.
These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon monitored
the marquis’s progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how the
countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms, listen more closely to
his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking questions about
him. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess would often look
up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon felt certain that the young
woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks now, maybe a
month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would fall.
A few days later the marquis was at the countess’s home. They were
alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own
impulse, rather than following Ninon’s instructions, he took the countess’s
hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed
confused, a reaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused
herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to
say good-night to him. The next few times he visited he was told she was
not at home. When she finally admitted him again, the two felt awkward
and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.
Interpretation
Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest
writers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers—men like
La Rochefoucauld, Molière, and Richelieu. Seduction was a game to her, to
be practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most
important families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in
matters of love.
Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it comes to
seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense when they
are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feeling of being
led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other person to detour
you into a strange country. Everything in seduction, however, depends on
suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in
words. Instead you must throw your targets off the scent. To surrender to
your guidance they must be appropriately confused. You have to scramble
your signals—appear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then
hint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on.
Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.
Imagine this story from the countess’s perspective: After a few of the
marquis’s moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,
but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her, but
so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her
waiting for the next one—she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for
sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security. Perhaps the
marquis had ulterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and
see, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was
up to would not have mattered.
The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word “love,” however, all was
changed. This was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show of
passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put
everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming
now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess felt embarrassed and used. A
door closed that would never open again.
Do not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without
being one. 
Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning. 
Baltasar Gracián, 1601-1658
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty-five-year-old deputy in
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be Prussia’s king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.
Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unification,
of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so long
had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warfare as a glorious
business.
This, after all, was the man who years later would say, “The great
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but
by iron and blood.”
Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless gave
a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished all who
heard it. “Woe unto the statesman,” he said, “who makes war without a
reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you will
all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage to
turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who has
been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?” Not only did
Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he
praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against the
war—what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused, and
several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his ministers
won out, and war was averted.
A few weeks after Bismarck’s infamous speech, the king, grateful that he
had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few years later he
became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually led his country and a
peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire
and establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head.
Interpretation
At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.
First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with
other European armies, was unready for war—that Austria, in fact, might
very well win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost
and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.
The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted
power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause
he detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole
country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck’s speech that the king made
him a minister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,
attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish what
he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unification of
Germany under Prussia’s leadership.
Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived, a
master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in
this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better to
wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since most
Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that their
army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king, asking to
be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would not have
succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition and doubted
his sincerity.
By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, however,
he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained everything he
wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.
KEYS TO POWER
Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their
opinions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and
intentions. They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to
always want to talk about one’s feelings and plans for the future. It takes
effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many
believe that by being honest and open they are winning people’s hearts and
showing their good nature. They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a
blunt instrument, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to
offend people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people
what they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you
feel or think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make
yourself so predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or
fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such
emotions.
If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always
have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one’s intentions is a
simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust
appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and
hear—constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else
would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal
one’s intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you
seem to aim for, in front of people’s eyes and they will take the appearance
for reality. Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflicting signals, such as desire
and indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
their desire to possess you.
A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to
support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to
play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want something
in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will be
thrown off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations.
During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of
Marlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French
fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that
if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted—to advance
down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it
with some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some
purpose of his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them
recapture it. Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that
the duke had wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was
gone, the road was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into
France.
Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people
suspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—just not
your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,
open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals on
time-consuming wild-goose chases.
Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sincerity.
People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember—their first instinct
is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and want to believe in
the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or see through
your act. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words great weight.
This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the depth of his
emotions, the apparent sincerity of his concerns about Desde mona’s
supposed infidelity, how could Othello distrust him? This is also how the
great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers’ eyes:
Seeming to believe so deeply in the decoyed object he was dangling in front
of them (a phony stock, a touted racehorse), he made its reality hard to
doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sincerity is a
tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be measured
and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.
To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your
intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as important social
values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this
subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought—though only one
that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon’s minister
Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence—a decoy—would then elicit
a real confidence on the other person’s part.
Remember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their
roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise
their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal
of weapons.
PART II: USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR
ACTIONS
Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a
screen of smoke to distract people attention from your real purpose. The
bland exterior—like the unreadable poker face—is often the perfect smoke
screen, hiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you
lead the sucker down a familiar path, he won’t catch on when you lead him
into a trap.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close
to $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his
many properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making.
One day a young man named Joseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy
an apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms: The price was
$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he would
sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay the full
$8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal Weil was
working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever businessman
like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up with so
much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluctant to
say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent. Finally,
after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following story.
JEHU, KING OF ISRAEL FEIGNS WORSHIP OF THE IDOL
BA‘AL
Then Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, “Ahab served Ba‘al
a little; but Jehu will serve him much more. Now therefore call to me all the
prophets of Ba’al, all his worshippers and all his priests; let none be
missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Ba‘al; whoever is missing
shall not live.” But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the
worshippers of Ba’al. And Jehu ordered, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for
Ba‘al. “So they proclaimed it. And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all
the worshippers of Ba’al came, so that there was not a man left who did not
come. And they entered the house of Ba‘al, and the house of Ba’al was
filled from one end to the other.... Then Jehu went into the house of Ba‘al ...
and he said to the worshippers of Ba’al, “Search, and see that there is no
servant of the LORD here among you, but only the worshippers of
Ba‘al.“Then he went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu
had stationed eighty men outside, and said, “The man who allows any of
those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life.” So as
soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the
guard and to the officers, “Go in and slay them; let not a man escape.” So
when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out
and went into the inner room of the house of Ba’al and they brought out the
pillar that was in the house of Ba‘al and burned it. And they demolished the
pillar of Ba’al and demolished the house of Ba‘al, and made it a latrine to
this day. Thus Jehu wiped out Ba’al from Israel.

Weil’s uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire financiers.
These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in Michigan ten
