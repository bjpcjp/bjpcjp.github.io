LAW 18
DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF—
ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS
JUDGMENT
The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere—everyone has to
protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to
more dangers than it Protects you from—it cuts you off from valuable
information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to
circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your
enemies by the crowd.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Ch‘in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.), was the
mightiest man of his day. His empire was vaster and more powerful than
that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms
surrounding his own kingdom of Ch’in and unified them into one massive
realm called China. But in the last years of his life, few, if anyone, saw him.
The emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in the
capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of these were
connected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to
move through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a different
room every night, and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on him was
instantly beheaded. Only a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if
they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death.
The first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that when he
had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising himself carefully.
On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly died. His body was
borne back to the capital in the emperor’s carriage, with a cart packed with
salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting corpse—no
one was to know of his death. He died alone, far from his wives, his family,
his friends, and his courtiers, accompanied only by a minister and a handful
of eunuchs.
THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
The “Red Death” had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever
been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatur and its seal—the redness
and horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and
then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.... And the whole
seizure, progress, and termination of the disease, were the incidents of half
an hour. But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.
When his dominions were half-depopulated, he summoned to his presence a
thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knight, and dames
of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his
castellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the
creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty
wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtier.s, having entered,
brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts. They resolved
to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of
despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply provisioned. With
such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The
external world could take care of itself In the meantime it was folly to
grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.
There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were ballet-dancers,
there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these and
security were within. Without was the “Red Death.” It was toward the close
of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged
most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand
friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence. It was a
voluptuous scene, that masquerade.... ... And the revel went whirlingly on,
until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock....
And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes of the last
chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many individuals in the
crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked
fzgecre which had arrested the attention of no single individual before....
The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the
habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made
so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest
scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this
might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But
the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His
vesture was dabbled in blood—and his broad brow, with all the features of
the face, was sprinkled with the scarlet horror ... ... A throng of the revellers
at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the
mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of
the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave
cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a
rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form. And now was acknowledged the
presence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And one
by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and
died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the ebony
clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods
expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable
dominion over all.
 
THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, EDGAR ALLAN POE, 1809-1849
Interpretation
Shih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch’in, a fearless warrior of
unbridled ambition. Writers of the time described him as a man with “a
waspish nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or
wolf.” He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he “swallowed men
up without a scruple.” It was through trickery and violence that he
conquered the provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a
single nation and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to
keep an eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered
across the realm’s various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 of them to the
capital, where he housed the most important courtiers in the vast palace of
Hsien-yang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them
into the Great Wall of China. He standardized the country’s laws, its written
language, even the size of its cartwheels.
As part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor
outlawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher whose
ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese
culture. On Shih Huang Ti’s order, thousands of books relating to Confucius
were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded. This
made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid, even
paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han-fei-tzu,
noted that “Ch’in has been victorious for four generations, yet has lived in
constant terror and apprehension of destruction.”
As the emperor withdrew deeper and deeper into the palace to protect
himself, he slowly lost control of the realm. Eunuchs and ministers enacted
political policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also
plotted against him. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so
isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been
poisoned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation.
That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a fortress and you lose contact
with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happening
around you, as well as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you cut
yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends. Never
enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is
happening around you, including the plots against you.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Louis XIV had the palace of Versailles built for him and his court in the
1660s, and it was like no other royal palace in the world. As in a beehive,
everything revolved around the royal person. He lived surrounded by the
nobility, who were allotted apartments nestled around his, their closeness to
him dependent on their rank. The king’s bedroom occupied the literal center
of the palace and was the focus of everyone’s attention. Every morning the
king was greeted in this room by a ritual known as the lever.
At eight A.M., the king’s first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal bed,
would awaken His Majesty. Then pages would open the door and admit
those who had a function in the lever. The order of their entry was precise:
First came the king’s illegitimate sons and his grandchildren, then the
princes and princesses of the blood, and then his physician and surgeon.
There followed the grand officers of the wardrobe, the king’s official reader,
and those in charge of entertaining the king. Next would arrive various
government officials, in ascending order of rank. Last but not least came
those attending the lever by special invitation. By the end of the ceremony,
the room would be packed with well over a hundred royal attendants and
visitors.
The day was organized so that all the palace’s energy was directed at and
passed through the king. Louis was constantly attended by courtiers and
officials, all asking for his advice and judgment. To all their questions he
usually replied, “I shall see.”
As Saint-Simon noted, “If he turned to someone, asked him a question,
made an insignificant remark, the eyes of all present were turned on this
person. It was a distinction that was talked of and increased prestige.” There
was no possibility of privacy in the palace, not even for the king—every
room communicated with another, and every hallway led to larger rooms
where groups of nobles gathered constantly. Everyone’s actions were
interdependent, and nothing and no one passed unnoticed: “The king not
only saw to it that all the high nobility was present at his court,” wrote
Saint-Simon, “he demanded the same of the minor nobility. At his lever and
coucher, at his meals, in his gardens of Versailles, he always looked about
him, noticing everything. He was offended if the most distinguished nobles
did not live permanently at court, and those who showed themselves never
or hardly ever, incurred his full displeasure. If one of these desired
something, the king would say proudly: ‘I do not know him,’ and the
judgment was irrevocable.”
Interpretation
Louis XIV came to power at the end of a terrible civil war, the Fronde. A
principal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which deeply resented
the growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism,
when the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the king had little authority
over them. The nobles had lost the civil war, but they remained a fractious,
resentful lot.
The construction of Versailles, then, was far more than the decadent
whim of a luxury-loving king. It served a crucial function: The king could
keep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around him. The once
proud nobility was reduced to squabbling over the right to help the king put
on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of privacy—no
possibility of isolation. Louis XIV very early grasped the truth that for a
king to isolate himself is gravely dangerous. In his absence, conspiracies
will spring up like mushrooms after rain, animosities will crystallize into
factions, and rebellion will break out before he has the time to react. To
combat this, sociability and openness must not only be encouraged, they
must be formally organized and channeled.
These conditions at Versailles lasted for Louis’s entire reign, some fifty
years of relative peace and tranquillity. Through it all, not a pin dropped
without Louis hearing it.
Solitude is dangerous to reason, without being favorable to virtue.... 
Remember that the solitary mortal is certainly luxurious, 
probably superstitious, and possibly mad. 
Dr. Samuel John son, 1709-1784
KEYS TO POWER
Machiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is
invariably a mistake. It becomes a symbol of power’s isolation, and is an
easy target for its builders’ enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses
actually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may
appear impregnable, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you
are; and a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison.
With their small and confined spaces, fortresses are also extremely
vulnerable to the plague and contagious diseases. In a strategic sense, the
isolation of a fortress provides no protection, and actually creates more
problems than it solves.
Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on social
interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place
yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity
should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything
happening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against
you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such
times they tend to retreat and close ranks, to find security in a kind of
fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a
smaller and smaller circle, and lose perspective on events around them.
They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation
makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation
often precedes defeat and death.
In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to
turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and
make new ones, force yourself into more and more different circles. This
has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.
The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and had
little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself
among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly,
identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were
connected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had
such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be
counterbalanced by an ally there.
The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way.
Although he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he
made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the
streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a
certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied
him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of
power—the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of
Louis XVIII—he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never
closed himself up in a small circle but always forged connections with the
new order.
This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest power:
The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in
isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you
can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating
to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects,
who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion.
Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts that
make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant exposure
and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more graceful
and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders an
awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people start
avoiding you.
In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici decided that to ensure the immortality
of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose
from, and in the end he picked Jacopo da Pontormo. Getting on in years,
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d’oeuvre and legacy. His
first decision was to close the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds.
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo himself. When some young men broke
into the chapel out of curiosity, Jacopo sealed it off even further.
Pontormo filled the chapel’s ceiling with biblical scenes—the Creation,
Adam and Eve, Noah’s ark, on and on. At the top of the middle wall he
painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on Judgment Day. The artist
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had
developed a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be
stolen.
Pontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormo’s
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist’s death, left a description of
what they looked like. There was a total lack of proportion. Scenes bumped
against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in another,
in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with detail but had
lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his description of
the frescoes by writing that if he continued, “I think I would go mad and
become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the eleven years
of time Jacopo spent on it, he entangled himself and anyone else who saw
it.” Instead of crowning Pontormo’s career, the work became his undoing.
These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the
human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with
an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no
longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history because,
as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened himself up to the masses,
making his work accessible to people no matter what their education and
taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense of
proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such art
remains cornered and powerless.
Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by
contact with other people. Instead of falling into the fortress mentality, view
the world in the following manner: It is like a vast Versailles, with every
room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able to float
in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That kind of
mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will be
unable to keep secrets from you, and from your enemies, who will be
unable to isolate you from your allies. Always on the move, you mix and
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a swift-moving creature.
Image: The Fortress. High 
up on the hill, the citadel be

Authority: A good and wise prince, desirous of maintaining that character,
and to avoid giving the opportunity to his sons to become oppressive, will
never build fortresses, so that they may place their reliance upon the good
will of their subjects, and not upon the strength of citadels. (Niccolò
Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
REVERSAL
It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping an
ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect
yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facilitate
is thought. The weight of society’s pressure to conform, and the lack of
distanc
