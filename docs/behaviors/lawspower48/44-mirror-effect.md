LAW 44
DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT
JUDGMENT
The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When
you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out
your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them
overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with
the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their
actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror
Effect.
MIRROR EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology
Mirrors have the power to disturb us. Gazing at our reflection in the mirror,
we most often see what we want to see—the image of ourselves with which
we are most comfortable. We tend not to look too closely, ignoring the
wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image, we
sometimes feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person
among other people, an object rather than a subject. That feeling makes us
shudder—we see ourselves, but from the outside, minus the thoughts, spirit,
and soul that fill our consciousness. We are a thing.
In using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing power
by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their movements to
unsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked, cloned, objectlike, an
image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the same thing slightly
differently and they might feel disarmed—you have perfectly reflected their
wishes and desires. This is the narcissistic power of mirrors. In either case,
the Mirror Effect unsettles your targets, whether angering or entrancing
them, and in that instant you have the power to manipulate or seduce them.
The Effect contains great power because it operates on the most primitive
emotions.
There are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power:
 
The Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon Medusa
had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face so ugly
that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fright. But the
hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze shield into a
mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide him as he crept up
and cut off her head without looking at her directly. If the shield in this
instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield: Medusa could
not see Perseus, she saw only her own reflected actions, and behind this
screen the hero stole up and destroyed her.
This is the essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your enemies do,
following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you are up
to—they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with you
depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; neutralize
it by playing a game of mimicry with them. The tactic has a mocking, even
infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience of
someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly—after a while, usually
not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Working more subtly as an
adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your own
strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your opponents into
the trap they planned for you.
This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the days
of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning. It is
also useful for disguising those situations in which you have no particular
strategy yourself. This is the Warrior’s Mirror.
THE MERCHANT AND HIS FRIEND
A certain merchant once had a great desire to make a long journey. Now in
regard that he was not very wealthy, “It is requisite, ”said he to himself,
“that before my departure I should leave some part of my estate in the city,
to the end that if I meet with ill luck in my travels, I may have wherewithal
to keep me at my return.”To this purpose he delivered a great number of
bars of iron, which were a principal part of his wealth, in trust to one of his
friends, desiring him to keep them during his absence; and then, taking his
leave, away he went. Some time after, having had but ill luck in his travels,
he returned home; and the first thing he did was to go to his friend, and
demand his iron: but his friend, who owed several sums of money, having
sold the iron to pay his own debts, made him this answer: “Truly,
friend,”said he, “I put your iron into a room that was close locked,
imagining it would have been there as secure as my own gold; but an
accident has happened which no one could have suspected, for there was a
rat in the room which ate it all up.” The merchant, pretending ignorance,
replied, “It is a terrible misfortune to me indeed; but I know of old that rats
love iron extremely; I have suffered by them many times before in the same
manner, and therefore can the better bear my present affliction.” This
answer extremely pleased the friend, who was glad to hear the merchant so
well inclined to believe that a rat had eaten his iron; and to remove all
suspicions, desired him to dine with him the next day. The merchant
promised he would, but in the meantime he met in the middle of the city one
of his friend’s children; the child he carried home, and locked up in a room.
The next day he went to his friend, who seemed to be in great affliction,
which he asked him the cause of, as if he had been perfectly ignorant of
what had happened. ”O, my dear friend,” answered the other, ”I beg you to
excuse me, if you do not see me so cheerful as otherwise I would be; I have
lost one of my children; I have had him cried by sound of trumpet, but I
know not what is become of him.” “O!” replied the merchant, ”I am
grieved to hear this; for yesterday in the evening, as I parted from hence, I
saw an owl in the air with a child in his claws; but whether it were yours I
cannot tell.” “Why, you most foolish and absurd creature!” replied the
friend, ”are you not ashamed to tell such an egregious lie? An owl, that
weighs at most not above two or three pounds, can he carry a boy that
weighs above fifty?” ”Why,” replied the merchant, ”do you make such a
wonder at that? As if in a country where one rat can eat a hundred tons’
weight of iron, it were such a wonder for an owl to carry a child that weighs
not over fifty pounds in all!” The friend, upon this, found that the merchant
was no such fool as he took him to be, begged his pardon for the cheat
which he designed to have put upon him, restored him the value of his iron,
and so had his son again.
FABLES, PILPAY, INDIA, FOURTH CENTURY
A reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect is the Shadow: You shadow
your opponents’ every move without their seeing you. Use the Shadow to
gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on, when you will
be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is effective because to
follow the movements of others is to gain valuable insights into their habits
and routines. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detectives and spies.
 
The Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of a pond, the
Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the
image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate
his love, he despaired and drowned himself. All of us have a similar
problem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love
excludes a love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsatisfied
and unfulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narcissism:
You look deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires,
their values, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making
yourself into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche
gives you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge of love.
This is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but
psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the
unsatisfied self-love of a child. Normally, people bombard us with their
experiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things
through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If
you can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost
feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed, all the more so because it
happens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously
reflected in the outside world, even though you might well be
manufacturing it for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own.
The Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and business; it
gives us both the Seducer’s and the Courtier’s Mirror.
 
The Moral Effect The power of verbal argument is extremely limited, and
often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As Gracián remarks,
“The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” The Moral Effect is a perfect
way to demonstrate your ideas through action. Quite simply, you teach
others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medicine.
In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you, and
do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly what
they did to you. You make them feel that their behavior has been
unpleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which
only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions
mirrored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt
or punish others with their unsocial behavior. You objectify the qualities
you want them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can
gaze at their follies and learn a lesson about themselves. This technique is
often used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with
unpleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher’s Mirror. Whether
or not there is actually anything wrong with the way people have treated
you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect it back to them in
a way that makes them feel guilty about it.
 
The Hallucinatory Effect. Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for they
create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually, though, you
are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone knows, cannot show
the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror is reversed. When Alice
goes through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll’s book, she enters a world
that is back-to-front, and more than just visually.
The Hallucinatory Effect comes from creating a perfect copy of an
object, a place, a person. This copy acts as a kind of dummy—people take it
for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing.
This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who strategically mimic the
real world to deceive you. It also has applications in any arena that requires
camouflage. This is the Deceiver’s Mirror.
OBSERVANCES OF MIRROR EFFECTS
Observance I
In February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the island of
Elba, where he had been imprisoned by the allied forces of Europe, and
returned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation, rallying troops
and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis
XVIII, off the throne. By March, however, having reestablished himself in
power, he had to face the fact that France’s situation had gravely changed.
The country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European
nations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted him or left
the country. Only one man remained from the old regime—Joseph Fouché,
his former minister of police.
Napoleon had relied on Fouché to do his dirty work throughout his
previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He
kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always
have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouché. If
suspected of some misdeed, the minister would not get angry or take the
accusation personally—he would submit, nod, smile, and change colors
chameleonlike, adapting to the requirements of the moment. At first this
had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming, but after a while it frustrated
Napoleon, who felt outdone by this slippery man. At one time or another he
had fired all of his most important ministers, including Talleyrand, but he
never touched Fouché. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need of help,
he felt he had no choice but to reappoint Fouché as his minister of police.
When you have come to grips and are striving together with the enemy, and
you realize that you cannot advance, you “soak in” and become one with
the enemy. You can win by applying a suitable technique while you are
mutually entangled. ... You can win often decisively with the advantage of
knowing how to “soak” into the enemy, whereas, were you to draw apart,
you would lose the chance to win.
 
A BOOK OF FIVE RINGS, MIYAMOTO MUSASHI, JAPAN,
SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
 
Several weeks into his new reign, Napoleon’s spies told him they
believed Fouché was in secret contact with ministers of foreign countries,
including Metternich of Austria. Afraid that his most valuable minister was
betraying him to his enemies, Napoleon had to find out the truth before it
was too late. He could not confront Fouché directly—in person the man was
as slippery as an eel. He needed hard proof.
This seemed to come in April, when the emperor’s private police
captured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass information
on to Fouché. Ordering the man brought before him, Napoleon threatened
to shoot him then and there unless he confessed; the man broke down and
admitted he had given Fouché a letter from Metternich, written in invisible
ink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Napoleon
accordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If
Fouché was indeed planning to betray him, he would finally be caught red-
handed and would hang.
Napoleon waited impatiently for the agent’s return, but to his
bewilderment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard
nothing that would implicate Fouché in a conspiracy. In fact it seemed that
the other agents present suspected Fouché of double-crossing them, as if he
were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an
instant—Fouché had somehow outwitted him again.
The following morning Fouché visited Napoleon, and remarked, “By the
way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few days
ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his
emissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing
legible.... Here at length is the letter.” Sure that Fouché was toying with
him, Napoleon exploded, “You are a traitor, Fouché! I ought to have you
hanged.” He continued to harangue Fouché, but could not fire him without
proof. Fouché only expressed amazement at the emperor’s words, but
inwardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring game.
Interpretation
Fouché had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those around him
by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game by
having his own spies spy on Napoleon’s spies, thus neutralizing any action
Napoleon might take against him. In the case of the meeting in Basel, he
even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleon’s double agent, he set it up
so that it would appear as if Fouché were a loyal double agent too.
Fouché gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult by
mirroring those around him. During the French Revolution he was a radical
Jacobin; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under
Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon ennobled
and made the duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the weapon of digging
up dirt on people, Fouché made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as well as
on everyone else. This also allowed him to predict the emperor’s plans and
desires, so that he could echo his boss’s sentiments before he had even
uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouché could also
plot offensive moves without being caught in the act.
THE FOX AND THE STORK
One day Mr. Fox decided to fork out And invite old Mrs. Stork out. The
dinner wasn’t elaborate—Being habitually mean, He didn’t go in for haute
cuisine-In fact it consisted of a shallow plate of thin gruel. Within a minute
our joker had lapped his plate clean; Meanwhile his guest, fishing away
with her beak, got not a morsel in it. To pay him back for this cruel
practical joke, the stork invited the fox to dinner the following week. “I
should be delighted,” He replied; “When it comes to friends I never stand
upon pride.” Punctually on the day he ran to his hostess’s house and at
once began praising everything: “What taste! What chic! And the food—
done just to a turn!” Then sat down with a hearty appetite (Foxes are
always ready to eat) And savored the delicious smell of meat. It was minced
meat and served—to serve him right!-In a long-necked, narrow-mouthed
urn. The stork, easily stooping, enjoyed her fill With her long bill; His
snout, though, being the wrong shape and size, he had to return to his den
empty-bellied, tail dragging, ears drooping, as red in the face as a fox who’s
been caught by a hen.

This is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give people
the feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect
you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing
them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and
unsettle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away
their initiative, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose
when and how to unsettle them—another avenue to power. And the mirror
saves you mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the
space you need to develop a strategy of your own.
Observance II
Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of
Athens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the
source of his power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their
moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their
inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were
superior to everyone else’s, and that his goal was to model himself on them
or help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm.
The first man to fall under his spell was the philosopher Socrates.
Alcibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and
uprightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled. Whenever
he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man’s sobriety, eating
simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of
philosophy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled—he was not
unaware of Alcibiades’ other life. But that only made him vulnerable to a
logic that flattered him: Only in my presence, he felt, does this man submit
to a virtuous influence; only I have such power over him. This feeling
intoxicated Socrates, who became Alcibiades’ fervent admirer and
supporter, one day even risking his own life to rescue the young man in
battle.
The Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, for he had an
uncanny ability to tune in to his audience’s aspirations, and mirror their
desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of the invasion of Sicily,
which he thought would bring great wealth to Athens and limitless glory to
himself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians’ thirst to
conquer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their
ancestors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men’s nostalgia for
the glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went
on to create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering Sicily;
Alcibiades’ p
