LAW 15
CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY
JUDGMENT
All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be
crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one
ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually
break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total
annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not
only in body but in spirit.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
No rivalry between leaders is more celebrated in Chinese history than the
struggle between Hsiang Yu and Liu Pang. These two generals began their
careers as friends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came from the
nobility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence and temper, a bit
dull witted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always fought at the head of
his troops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He had never been much of a
soldier, and preferred women and wine to fighting; in fact, he was
something of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to
recognize the best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their
advice. He had risen in the army through these strengths.
The remnants of an enemy can become active like those of a disease or fire.
Hence, these should be exterminated completely.... One should never ignore
an enemy, knowing him to be weak. He becomes dangerous in due course,
like the spark of fire in a haystack.
KAUTILYA, INDIAN PHILOSOPHER, THIRD CENTURY B.C.
In 208 B.C., the king of Ch‘u sent two massive armies to conquer the
powerful kingdom of Ch’in. One army went north, under the generalship of
Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in command; the other, led by Liu Pang,
headed straight toward Ch’in. The target was the kingdom’s splendid
capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not
stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsien-yang first, and perhaps
would assume command of the entire army.
THE TRAP AT SINIGAGLIA
On the day Ramiro was executed, Cesare [Borgia] quit Cesena, leaving the
mutilated body on the town square, and marched south. Three days later he
arrived at Fano, where he received the envoys of the city of Ancona, who
assured him of their loyalty. A messenger from Vitellozzo Vitelli announced
that the little Adriatic port of Sinigaglia had surrendered to the condottieri
[mercenary soldiers]. Only the citadel, in charge of the Genoese Andrea
Doria, still held out, and Doria refused to hand it over to anyone except
Cesare himself. [Borgia] sent word that he would arrive the next day, which
was just what the condottieri wanted to hear. Once he reached Sinigaglia.
Cesare would be an easy prey, caught between the citadel and their forces
ringing the town.... The condottieri were sure they had military superiority,
believing that the departure of the French troops had left Cesare with only a
small force.
In fact, according to Machiavelli. [Borgia] had left Cesena with ten
thousand infantry-men and three thousand horse, taking pains to split up
his men so that they would march along parallel routes before converging
on Sinigaglia. The reason for such a large force was that he knew, from a
confession extracted from Ramiro de Lorca, what the condottieri had up
their sleeve. He therefore decided to turn their own trap against them. This
was the masterpiece of trickery that the historian Paolo Giovio later called
“the magnificent deceit.” At dawn on December 31 [1502], Cesare reached
the outskirts of Sinigaglia.... Led by Michelotto Corella, Cesare’s advance
guard of two hundred lances took up its position on the canal bridge.... This
control of the bridge effectively prevented the conspirators’ troops from
withdrawing....
Cesare greeted the condottieri effusively and invited them to join him....
Michelotto had prepared the Palazzo Bernardino for Cesare’s use, and the
duke invited the condottieri inside.... Once indoors the men were quietly
arrested by guards who crept up from the rear.... [Cesare] gave orders for
an attack on Vitelli’s and Orsini’s soldiers in the outlying areas.... That
night, while their troops were being crushed, Michelotto throttled Oliveretto
and Vitelli in the Bernardino palace.... At one fell swoop, [Borgia] had got
rid of his former generals and worst enemies.
THE BORGIAS, IVAN CLOULAS, 1989
 
At one point on the northern front, Hsiang’s commander, Sung Yi,
hesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung
Yi’s tent, proclaimed him a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole
command of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northern front
and marched directly on Hsien-yang. He felt certain he was the better
soldier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his rival, leading
a smaller, swifter army, managed to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an
adviser, Fan Tseng, who warned him, “This village headman [Liu Pang]
used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital
he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming
high.”
Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his rival before it was too late. He told the
general to invite the wily peasant to a banquet at their camp outside Hsien-
yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his head cut
off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and came to the banquet.
But Hsiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the time he gave
the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape. “Bah!” cried Fan
Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot. “One cannot plan
with a simpleton. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet and make us all his
prisoners.”
Realizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang, this
time determined to hack off his rival’s head. Liu was never one to fight
when the odds were against him, and he abandoned the city. Hsiang
captured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch’in, and burned the
city to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang’s bitter enemy, and he pursued him
for many months, finally cornering him in a walled city. Lacking food, his
army in disarray, Liu sued for peace.
Again Fan Tseng warned Hsiang, “Crush him now! If you let him go
again, you will be sorry later.” But Hsiang decided to be merciful. He
wanted to bring Liu back to Ch’u alive, and to force his former friend to
acknowledge him as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the
negotiations for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small
army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his rival slip away, once
more set out after Liu, this time with such ferocity that he seemed to have
lost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu’s father in battle, Hsiang
stood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of
troops, “Surrender now, or I shall boil your father alive!” Liu calmly
answered, “But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If
you insist on boiling your own father, send me a bowl of the soup!” Hsiang
backed down, and the struggle continued.
A few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his forces
unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main
garrison. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was Hsiang who
sued for peace. Liu’s top adviser urged him to destroy Hsiang, crush his
army, show no mercy. “To let him go would be like rearing a tiger—it will
devour you later,” the adviser said. Liu agreed.
Making a false treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense, then
slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and on
foot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a small
group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, “I hear Liu Pang has
offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families for
my head. Let me do you a favor.” Then he slit his own throat and died.
Interpretation
Hsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely
hesitated in doing away with a rival if it served his purposes. But with Liu
Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat
him through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battlefield,
even to force the clever Liu to surrender and to serve him. Every time he
had his rival in his hands, something made him hesitate—a fatal sympathy
with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and
comrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to
do away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu
would not suffer the same hesitation once the tables were turned.
This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our enemies,
when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from doing
away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of us. We have
beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture these resentful vipers
who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt with this way. It must be
exterminated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt us. This is
all the truer with a former friend who has become an enemy. The law
governing fatal antagonisms reads: Reconciliation is out of the question.
Only one side can win, and it must win totally.
Liu Pang learned this lesson well. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this son of
a farmer went on to become supreme commander of the armies of Ch‘u.
Crushing his next rival—the king of Ch’u, his own former leader—he
crowned himself emperor, defeated everyone in his path, and went down in
history as one of the greatest rulers of China, the immortal Han Kao-tsu,
founder of the Han Dynasty.
To have ultimate victory, you must be ruthless.
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, 1769-1821
 
Those who seek to achieve things should show no mercy.
Kautilya, Indian philosopher third century B.C.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Wu Chao, born in A.D. 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a beautiful
young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached to the harem
of Emperor T’ai Tsung.
The imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young concubines
vying to become the emperor’s favorite. Wu’s beauty and forceful character
quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other
powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced,
she kept her eye on the future.
Wu managed to seduce the emperor’s dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the
only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was
relieving himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and
Kao Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives
and concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law:
Her head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the
rest of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating
in secret with the new emperor, and by befriending his wife, the empress,
she managed to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the
palace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress,
while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage this—
she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was
vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally.
In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to visit,
and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn—her own baby.
When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the
empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous
nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu’s plan. Shortly thereafter,
the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was crowned
empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of pleasure,
gladly gave up the reins of government to Wu Chao, who was from then on
known as Empress Wu.
Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure. There
were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one
moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her
beautiful young niece was becoming the emperor’s favorite. She poisoned
the woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as
the heir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next-eldest son—illegitimate,
but now the crown prince—was exiled a little later on trumped-up charges.
And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after that
declared unfit for the throne. All this meant that it was her youngest, most
ineffectual son who finally became emperor. In this way she continued to
rule.
Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no
one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of
Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy
and Divine “Emperor” of China.
Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from the
previous T’ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade
of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate.
Interpretation
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At the
time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a few
years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In Wu’s
gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She knew that
any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would spell her end. If, every
time she got rid of a rival a new one appeared, the solution was simple: She
had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors before her had
followed the same path to the top, but Wu—who, as a woman, had next to
no chance to gain power—had to be more ruthless still.
Empress Wu’s forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese history.
Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known, in China she
is considered one of the period’s most able and effective rulers.
A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ramón Maria
Narváez. 
(1800-1868), “Does your Excellency forgive all your enemies ? ”I do not 
have to forgive my enemies,” answered Narváez, ”I have had them all shot.
”
KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and
returned to haunt the lenient. “Crush the enemy” is a key strategic tenet of
Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.C. author of The Art of War. The idea is
simple: Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to
eliminate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even
three quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only
make them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take
revenge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.
The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they
would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for
from your enemies is their disappearance.
Mao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history
generally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist leader
and some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains
of western China to escape Chiang Kai-shek’s much larger army, in what
has since been called the Long March.
Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a few
years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact, when
China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the Communists were
no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase and concentrate on the
Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered enough to rout
Chiang’s army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of crushing the
enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his entire army fled
to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in mainland China to
this day.
The wisdom behind “crushing the enemy” is as ancient as the Bible: Its
first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Himself,
when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water flow back over
the pursuing Egyptians so that “not so much as one of them remained.”
When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments and
found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had every last offender
slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his followers, finally about to
enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated the tribes of Canaan
they should “utterly destroy them... make no covenant with them, and show
no mercy to them.”
The goal of total victory is an axiom of modern warfare, and was codified
as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Analyzing
the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, “We do claim that direct
annihilation of the enemy’s forces must always be the dominant
consideration.... Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of
rest, of breathing space... but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy again,
seizing his capital, attacking his reserves and anything else that might give
his country aid and comfort.” The reason for this is that after war come
negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a partial
victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have gained by
war.
The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate them
and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control your
enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford to go
halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bidding.
This law has applications far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the
insidious viper that will eat away at your victory, so give your enemies
nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed and
that is that.
Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and
create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will remain
your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on them,
deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. Just recognize that
there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as you stay
in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as certainly
as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just silly; as
Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.
Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:
Never go halfway.
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.
Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your
enemies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering,
insinuating themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at
least understand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to
whatever friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is
your own wariness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for
the best time to act.
Image: A Viper crushed beneath your foot but left alive, will rear up and
bite you with a double dose of venom. An enemy that is left around is like a
half-dead viper that you nurse back to health. Time makes the venom grow
stronger.
 
 
 
Authority: For it must be noted, that men must either be caressed or else
annihilated; they will revenge themselves for small injuries, but cannot do
so for great ones; the injury therefore that we do to a man must be such that
we need not fear his vengeance. (Niccolò Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
REVERSAL
This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that it
is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possible,
than to make
