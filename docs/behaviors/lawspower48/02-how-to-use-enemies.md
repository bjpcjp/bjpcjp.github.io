LAW 2
NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW
TO USE ENEMIES
JUDGMENT
Be wary of friends—they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily
aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a
former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more
to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If
you have no enemies, find a way to make them.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In the mid-ninth century A.D., a young man named Michael III assumed the
throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora, had
been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been murdered ;
at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone Michael had
been Michael’s uncle, Bardas, a man of intelligence and ambition. Michael
was now a young, inexperienced ruler, surrounded by intriguers, murderers,
and profligates. In this time of peril he needed someone he could trust as his
councillor, and his thoughts turned to Basilius, his best friend. Basilius had
no experience whatsoever in government and politics—in fact, he was the
head of the royal stables—but he had proven his love and gratitude time and
again.
To have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to strike.
DIANF DE POITIERS, 1499-1566, MISTRESS OF HENRI II OF
FRANCE
They had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the
stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a young groom from peasant
Macedonian stock, had saved Michael’s life. The groom’s strength and
courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius from the
obscurity of being a horse trainer to the position of head of the stables. He
loaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable.
Basilius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the crude peasant
became a cultured and sophisticated courtier.
Every time I bestow a vacant office I make a hundred discontented persons
and one ingrate.
Louis XIV, 1638-1715
Now Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could he
better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a young
man who owed him everything?
Basilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved him like a
brother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more
qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend.
Thus for my own part I have more than once been deceived by the person I
loved most and of whose love, above everyone else’s, I have been most
confident. So that I believe that it may be right to love and serve one person
above all others, according to merit and worth, but never to trust so much
in this tempting trap of friendship as to have cause to repent of it later on.
BALDASSARE CASTIGLIONE, 1478-1529
Basilius learned well and was soon advising the emperor on all matters of
state. The only problem seemed to be money—Basiiius never had enough.
Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made him avaricious for
the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, ennobled him,
and married him off to his own mistress, Eudoxiaingerina. Keeping such a
trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price. But more trouble
was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and Basilius convinced
Michael that the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under the illusion that he
could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put him on the throne,
and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of Michael and assume the
crown himself. Basilius poured poison into Michael’s ear until the emperor
agreed to have his uncle murdered. During a great horse race, Basilius
closed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed him to death. Soon after,
Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of the army, where he could
keep control of the realm and quell rebellion. This was granted.
Now Basilius’s power and wealth only grew, and a few years later
Michael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked him to pay
back some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael’s
shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence
that the emperor suddenly realized his predicament: The former stable boy
had more money, more allies in the army and senate, and in the end more
power than the emperor himself. A few weeks later, after a night of heavy
drinking, Michael awoke to find himself surrounded by soldiers. Basilius
watched as they stabbed the emperor to death. Then, after proclaiming
himself emperor, he rode his horse through the streets of Byzantium,
brandishing the head of his former benefactor and best friend at the end of a
long pike.
THE SNAKE, THE FARMER, AND THE HERON
A snake chased by hunters asked a farmer to save its life. To hide it from its
pursuers, the farmer squatted and let the snake crawl into his belly. But
when the danger had passed and the farmer asked the snake to come out,
the snake refused. It was warm and safe inside. On his way home, the man
saw a heron and went up to him and whispered what had happened. The
heron told him to squat and strain to eject the snake. When the snake snuck
its head out, the heron caught it, pulled it out, and killed it. The farmer was
worried that the snake’s poison might still be inside him, and the heron told
him that the cure for snake poison was to cook and eat six white fowl.
“You’re a white fowl,” said the farmer. “You’ll do for a start.” He grabbed
the heron, put it in a bag, and carried it home, where he hung it up while he
told his wife what had happened. “I’m surprised at you, ” said the wife.
“The bird does you a kindness, rids you of the evil in your belly, saves your
life in fact, yet you catch it and talk of killing it. She immediately released
the heron, and it flew away. But on its way, it gouged out her eyes.
Moral: When you see water flowing uphill, it means that someone is
repaying a kindness.
AFRICAN FOLK TALE
Interpretation
Michael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius
must feel for him. Surely Basilius would serve him best; he owed the
emperor his wealth, his education, and his position. Then, once Basilius was
in power, anything he needed it was best to give to him, strengthening the
bonds between the two men. It was only on the fateful day when the
emperor saw that impudent smile on Basilius’s face that he realized his
deadly mistake.
He had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up close—
a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and got it, who felt
encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what many
people do in such a situation: They forget the favors they have received and
imagine they have earned their success by their own merits.
At Michael’s moment of realization, he could still have saved his own
life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody
believes a friend can betray. And Michael went on disbelieving until the day
his head ended up on a pike.
Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.
Voltaire, 1694-1778
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (A.D. 222), Chinese
history followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the
other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace him
on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new
dynasty and crown himself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would
kill off his fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would
resume: New generals would rise up and assassinate him or his sons in their
turn. To be emperor of China was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of
enemies—it was the least powerful, least secure position in the realm.
In A.D. 959, General Chao K’uang-yin became Emperor Sung. He knew
the odds, the probability that within a year or two he would be murdered ;
how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor, Sung
ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most
powerful commanders in the army. After they had drunk much wine, he
dismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who now
feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed them:
“The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table and in
my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the throne? I do
not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subordinates, seeking
wealth and position, were to force the emperor’s yellow robe upon you in
turn, how could you refuse it?” Drunk and fearing for their lives, the
generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But Sung had other
ideas: “The best way to pass one’s days is in peaceful enjoyment of riches
and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands, I am ready to
provide you with fine estates and beautiful dwellings where you may take
your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions.”
The astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and
struggle Sung was offering them riches and security. The next day, all of the
generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the estates
that Sung bestowed on them.
There are many who think therefore that a wise prince ought, when he has
the chance, to foment astutely some enmity, so that by suppressing it he will
augment his greatness. Princes, and especially new ones, have found more
faith and more usefulness in those men, whom at the beginning of their
power they regarded with suspicion, than in those they at first confided in.
Pandolfo Petrucci, prince of Siena, governed his state more by those whom
he suspected than by others.
NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI, 1469-1527
In one stroke, Sung turned a pack of “friendly” wolves, who would likely
have betrayed him, into a group of docile lambs, far from all power.
Over the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his rule.
In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him after
years of rebellion. To Liu’s astonishment, Sung gave him a rank in the
imperial court and invited him to the palace to seal their newfound
friendship with wine. As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered him, he
hesitated, fearing it contained poison. “Your subject’s crimes certainly merit
death,” he cried out, “but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject’s life.
Indeed I dare not drink this wine.” Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass
from Liu, and swallowed it himself. There was no poison. From then on Liu
became his most trusted and loyal friend.
At the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When
Ch‘ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung’s ministers
advised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents
proving that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch’ien Shu came to
visit the emperor, however, instead of locking him up, Sung honored him.
He also gave him a package, which he told the former king to open when he
was halfway home. Ch’ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey and
saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspiracy. He realized
that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared him nonetheless.
This generosity won him over, and he too became one of Sung’s most loyal
vassals.
A brahman, a great expert in Veda who has become a great archer as well,
offers his services to his good friend, who is now the king. The brahman
cries out when he sees the king, “Recognize me, your friend!” The king
answers him with contempt and then explains: “Yes, we were friends before,
but our friendship was based on what power we had.... I was friends with
you, good brahman, because it served my purpose. No pauper is friend to
the rich, no fool to the wise, no coward to the brave. An old friend—who
needs him? It is two men of equal wealth and equal birth who contract
friendship and marriage, not a rich man and a pauper.... An old friend—
who needs him?
THE MAHABHARATA, C. THIRD CENTURY B.C.
Interpretation
A Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous
animal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Emperor
Sung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne:
His “friends” in the army would chew him up like meat, and if he somehow
survived, his “friends” in the government would have him for supper.
Emperor Sung would have no truck with “friends”—he bribed his fellow
generals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much
better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have
led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have nothing to do
with “friendly” ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking
his famous cup of poisoned wine.
Instead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the other,
transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend expects
more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former enemies
expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the guillotine
is a grateful man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for the man
who has pardoned him. In time, these former enemies became Sung’s most
trusted friends.
Pick up a bee from kindness, and learn the limitations of kindness.
SUFI PROVERB
And Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and
civil war—the Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred
years.
In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, 
he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in 
error. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable 
enemies who must be destroyed. “Why, madam,” Lincoln replied, 
“do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?”
KEYS TO POWER
It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times
of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness.
Besides, you know them. Why depend on a stranger when you have a friend
at hand?
Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a
burden and revenge a pleasure.
TACITUS, c. A.D. 55-120
The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you
imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They
cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They
laugh extra hard at each other’s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens
friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say
that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes—
maybe they mean it, often they do not.
When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he
or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that
unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve their good fortune.
The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have been
chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are deserving.
There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring friends that
secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little more
honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before you
know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to
revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.
Ingratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its powers
for so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue to
underestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a
friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.
The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit
your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and
in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly
feelings. (Michael III had a man right under his nose who would have
steered him right and kept him alive: That man was Bardas.)
PROFITING BY OUR ENEMIES
King Hiero chanced upon a time, speaking with one of his enemies, to be
told in a reproachful manner that he had stinking breath. Whereupon the
good king, being somewhat dismayed in himself, as soon as he returned
home chided his wife, “How does it happen that you never told me of this
problem?” The woman, being a simple, chaste. and harmless dame, said,
“Sir, I had thought all men breath had smelled so.” Thus it is plain that
faults that are evident to the senses, gross and corporal, or otherwise
notorious to the world, we know by our enemies sooner than by our friends
and familiars.
PLUTARCH, C. A.D. 46-120
All working situations require a kind of distance between people. You are
trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only obscures
that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best able to
further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship, but work
with the skilled and competent.
Your enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you
must learn to exploit. When Talleyrand, Napoleon’s foreign minister,
decided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had
come to turn against him, he understood the dangers of conspiring against
the emperor; he needed a partner, a confederate—what friend could he trust
in such a project? He chose Joseph Fouché, head of the secret police, his
most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have him assassinated. He
knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emotional
reconciliation. He knew that Fouché would expect nothing from him, and in
fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyrand’s choice; a
person who has something to prove will move mountains for you. Finally,
he knew that his relationship with Fouché would be based on mutual self-
interest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The selection
proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in toppling
Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners generated much
interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to spread. And
from then on, Talleyrand and Fouché had a fruitful working relationship.
Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an enemy, and make a point of
putting him in your service.
As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him.
In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of an
unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others, the
renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more Catholic
priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret Service or
the Justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning meeting
with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that he would
have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he completely
charmed them. They gave him some “Kidnap Kissinger” buttons and one of
them remained a friend of his for years, visiting him on several occasions.
This was not just a onetime ploy: Kissinger made a policy of working with
those who disagreed with him. Colleagues commented that he seemed to get
along better with his enemies than with his friends.
Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels
sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert. It is sometimes better, then,
to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends or
allies.
Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the
Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao’s
Communists and their enemy, the Nationalists.
Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist leaders
advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using the time
to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly defeat and
occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the Communists
would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for several ye
