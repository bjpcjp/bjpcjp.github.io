LAW 4
ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY
JUDGMENT
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the
more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying
something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended,
and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The
more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Gnaeus Marcius, also known as Coriolanus, was a great military hero of
ancient Rome. In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many
important battles, saving the city from calamity time and time again.
Because he spent most of his time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him
personally, making him something of a legendary figure.
In 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation and
enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul. Candidates
for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race, and
when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the
dozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for
Rome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed;
those scars, proof of his valor and patriotism, moved the people to tears.
Coriolanus’s election seemed certain.
When the polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry into
the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city’s patricians, the
aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a
blustering show of confidence on election day.
And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citizens
who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent. Claiming
certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits, made sour
jokes that appealed only to the patricians, voiced angry accusations against
his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to Rome. This
time the people listened: They had not realized that this legendary soldier
was also a common braggart.
Down on his luck, [the screenwriter] Michael Arlen went to New York in
1944. To drown his sorrows he paid a visit to the famous restaurant “21.”
In the lobby, he ran into Sam Goldwyn, who offered the somewhat
impractical advice that he should buy racehorses. At the bar Arlen met
Louis B. Mayer, an old acquaintance, who asked him what were his plans
for the future. “I was just talking to Sam Goldwyn ...” began Arlen. “How
much did he offer you? ”interrupted Mayer. “Not enough,” he replied
evasively. “Would you take fifteen thousand for thirty weeks?” asked Mayer.
No hesitation this time. “Yes,” said Arlen.

ED., 1985
News of Coriolanus’s second speech spread quickly through Rome, and
the people turned out in great numbers to make sure he was not elected.
Defeated, Coriolanus returned to the battlefield, bitter and vowing revenge
on the common folk who had voted against him. Some weeks later a large
shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distribute this
food to the people, for free, but just as they were preparing to vote on the
question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate floor. The
distribution, he argued, would have a harmful effect on the city as a whole.
Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distribution fell
into doubt. Coriolanus did not stop there: He went on to condemn the
concept of democracy itself. He advocated getting rid of the people’s
representatives—the tribunes—and turning over the governing of the city to
the patricians.
One oft-told tale about Kissinger... involved a report that Winston Lord had
worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the
notation, “Is this the best you can do?” Lord rewrote and polished and
finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After
redrafting it one more time—and once again getting the same question from
Kissinger-Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do. ” To which
Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time. ”
KISSINGER. WALTER ISAACSON, 1992
When word of Coriolanus’s latest speech reached the people, their anger
knew no bounds. The tribunes were sent to the senate to demand that
Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over the
city. The senate, fearing the people’s wrath, finally voted in favor of the
grain distribution. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still
demanded that Coriolanus speak to them and apologize. If he repented, and
agreed to keep his opinions to himself, he would be allowed to return to the
battlefield.
Coriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who listened to
him in rapt silence. He started slowly and softly, but as the speech went on,
he became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults! His tone was
arrogant, his expression disdainful. The more he spoke, the angrier the
people became. Finally they shouted him down and silenced him.
The tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and ordered the
magistrates to take him at once to the top of the Tarpeian rock and throw
him over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision. The patricians,
however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was commuted to a
lifelong banishment. When the people found out that Rome’s great military
hero would never return to the city, they celebrated in the streets. In fact no
one had ever seen such a celebration, not even after the defeat of a foreign
enemy.
Interpretation
Before his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked awe.
His battlefield accomplishments showed him as a man of great bravery.
Since the citizens knew little about him, all kinds of legends became
attached to his name. The moment he appeared before the Roman citizens,
however, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and mystery vanished. He
bragged and blustered like a common soldier. He insulted and slandered
people, as if he felt threatened and insecure. Suddenly he was not at all what
the people had imagined. The discrepancy between the legend and the
reality proved immensely disappointing to those who wanted to believe in
their hero. The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he appeared—a
person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself,
and is unworthy of respect.
The King [Louis XIV] maintains the most impenetrable secrecy about
affairs of State. The ministers attend council meetings, but he confides his
plans to them only when he has reflected at length upon them and has come
to a definite decision. I wish you might see the King. His expression is
inscrutable; his eyes like those of a fox. He never discusses State affairs
except with his ministers in Council. When he speaks to courtiers he refers
only to their respective prerogatives or duties. Even the most frivolous of his
utterances has the air of being the pronouncement of an oracle.
 
PRIMI VISCONTI, QUOTED IN LOUIS XIV, LOUIS BERTRAND, 1928
 
Had Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to be
offended by him, would never have known his true feelings. He would have
maintained his powerful aura, would certainly have been elected consul,
and would have been able to accomplish his antidemocratic goals. But the
human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to break
out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you grief.
Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words.
Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees one 
it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close 
again so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens 
his mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener.
Leonardo da Vinci, 1452-1519
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and
nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make and break
alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of
them would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis himself, who
would decide what should be done. After these persons were chosen,
everyone would argue some more: How should the issues be phrased? What
would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what time of day should
the representatives approach him, and in what part of the Versailles palace?
What expression should they have on their faces?
Finally, after all this was settled, the fateful moment would finally arrive.
The two men would approach Louis—always a delicate matter—and when
they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand, spelling out
the options in detail.
Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. Finally,
when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the king’s
opinion, he would look at them both and say, “I shall see.” Then he would
walk away.
The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this
subject from the king—they would simply see the result, weeks later, when
he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult
them on the matter again.
Undutiful words of a subject do often take deeper root than the memory of
ill deeds.... The late Earl of Essex told Queen Elizabeth that her conditions
were as crooked as her carcass; but it cost him his head, which his
insurrection had not cost him but for that speech.
SIR WALTER RALEIGH. 1554-1618
Interpretation
Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is
“L‘état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”); nothing could be more pithy yet more
eloquent. His infamous “I shall see” was one of several extremely short
phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.
Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talking
at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity was self-
imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict his reactions. No one
could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to hear,
because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and on to
the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves,
information he would later use against them to great effect.
In the end, Louis’s silence kept those around him terrified and under his
thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint-Simon wrote,
“No one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his smile, even his
glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words.”
It is even more damaging for a minister to say foolish things than to do
them. 
Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679
KEYS TO POWER
Power is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say less than
necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are.
Your silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines
of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are thinking.
When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce your
intentions or your meaning.
Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and they
will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments that
will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses. They
will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and they
will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to your brief
comments will only add to your power.
Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most
areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you
appear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it
was generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do
by talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert your wishes,
disobey you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, “I learned that
you actually have more power when you shut up.”
In his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His
interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something
vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to
figure it out, imagining there was something profound behind his often
meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked about his work; he let others do
the interpreting. He claimed to have learned this technique from that master
of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who realized
early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked about
it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.
By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning and
power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something
foolish, even dangerous. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the
throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals
demanding that the country modernize—that its industries and civil
structures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion
(the Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders,
Kondraty Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on
the gallows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened—but as
Ryleyev dangled, the rope broke, dashing him to the ground. At the time,
events like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a
man saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got
to his feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he
called out to the crowd, “You see, in Russia they don’t know how to do
anything properly, not even how to make rope!”
A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the
failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I
nevertheless began to sign the pardon. But then: “Did Ryleyev say anything
after this miracle?” the czar asked the messenger. “Sire,” the messenger
replied, “he said that in Russia they don’t even know how to make rope.”
“In that case,” said the Czar, “let us prove the contrary,” and he tore up
the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the rope did
not break.
Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back.
Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The
momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed
by the price you pay.

When visitors consulted the 
Oracle, the priestess would utter 
a few enigmatic words that seemed 
full of meaning and import. No one 
disobeyed the words of the Oracle—
they held power over life and death.
 
 
 
Authority: Never start moving your own lips and teeth before the
subordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others move their lips
and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I can thereby understand their
real intentions.... If the sovereign is not mysterious, the ministers will find
opportunity to take and take. (Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third
century B.C.)
REVERSAL
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion
and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous
comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for.
Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then,
and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester,
who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks
and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool.
Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any
deception you might practice. By bending your listener’s ear with talk, you
can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less
suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and
manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the
silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making
yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can practice
deception with greater ease.
