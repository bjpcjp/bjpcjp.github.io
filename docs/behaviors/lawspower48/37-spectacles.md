LAW 37
CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES
JUDGMENT
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power—
everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then, full
of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.
Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.
ANTONY AND CLEOPATHA
She relied above all upon her physical presence and the spell and
enchantment which it could create.... She came sailing up the river Cydnus
in a barge with a poop of gold, its purple sails billowing in the wind, while
her rowers caressed the water with oars of silver which dipped in time to
the music of the flute, accompanied by pipes and lutes. Cleopatra herself
reclined beneath a canopy of cloth of gold, dressed in the character of
Aphrodite, as we see her in paintings, while on either side to complete the
picture stood boys costumed as Cupids who cooled her with their fans.
Instead of a crew the barge was lined with the most beautiful of her waiting-
women attired as Nereids and Graces, some at the rudders, others at the
tackle of the sails, and all the while an indescribably rich perfume, exhaled
from innumerable censers, was wafted from the vessel to the riverbanks.
Great multitudes accompanied this royal progress, some of them following
the queen on both sides of the river from its very mouth, while others
hurried down from the city of Tarsus to gaze at the sight. Gradually the
crowds drifted away from the marketplace, where Antony awaited the queen
enthroned on his tribunal, until at last he was left sitting quite alone. And
the word spread on every side that Aphrodite had come to revel with
Dionysus for the happiness of Asia. Antony then sent a message inviting
Cleopatra to dine with him. But she thought it more appropriate that he
should come to her, and so, as he wished to show his courtesy and goodwill,
he accepted and went. He found the preparations made to receive him
magnificent bevond words, but what astonished him most of all was the
extraordinary number of lights. So many of these, it is said, were let down
from the roof and displayed on all sides at once, and they were arranged
and grouped in suchingenious patterns in relation to each other, some in
squares and some in circles, that they created as brilliant a spectacle as can
ever have been devised to delight the eve.
 
LIFE OF ANTONY, PLUTARCH, c. A.D. 46-120
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
In the early 1780s, word spread through Berlin of the strange and
spectacular medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his miracles
in an enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice
ever longer lines of people—the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness
incurable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that the doctor worked
by exposing the patient to the rays of the moon, he soon became dubbed
The Moon Doctor of Berlin.
Sometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well-to-
do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previously
only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer hall in
their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gentlemen
in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street as sunset
drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of sheer
curiosity. As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to the
gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon was in
its increscent phase. Many would add that they themselves had already been
exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of the moon.
Even those who felt cured kept coming back, drawn by this powerful
experience.
Inside the beer hall, a strange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor:
Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and ethnic
backgrounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows on the
northern side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The
doctor and his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure,
practiced on the second floor, which was reached by a stairway, at the end
of the hall. As the line edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts
and cries from above, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind
gentleman suddenly able to see.
Once upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a northern
room for the doctor, a southern one for his wife, who worked only on the
ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gentlemen
patients would be led before the amazing doctor himself, an elderly man
with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy. He would
take the patient (let us say a young boy, brought in by his father), uncover
the afflicted body part, and lift the boy up to the window, which faced the
light of the moon. He would rub the site of the injury or illness, mumble
something unintelligible, look knowingly at the moon, and then, after
collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way. Meanwhile, in
the south-facing room, his wife would be doing the same with the ladies—
which was odd, really, since the moon cannot appear in two places at once;
it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both windows. Apparently
the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon were enough, for the ladies
did not complain, and would later remark confidently that the wife of the
Moon Doctor had the same healing powers as he.
Interpretation
Dr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine, but he understood
human nature. He recognized that people do not always want words, or
rational explanations, or demonstrations of the powers of science; they want
an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give them that and they will do the
rest—such as imagine they can be healed by the light reflected from a rock
a quarter million miles away. Dr. Weisleder had no need of pills, or of
lengthy lectures on the moon’s power, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify its
rays. He understood that the simpler the spectacle the better—just the
moonlight pouring in from the side, the stairway leading to the heavens, and
the rays of the moon, whether directly visible or not. Any added effects
might have made it seem that the moon was not strong enough on its own.
And the moon was strong enough—it was a magnet for fantasies, as it has
been throughout history. Simply by associating himself with the image of
the moon, the doctor gained power.
Remember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You must
always circumvent people’s suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your
will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the
seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming
the eyes, they create powerful associations, bringing people together and
stirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your
targets are blinded to the deceptions you practice.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1536 the future king Henri II of France took his first mistress, Diane de
Poitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the widow of the grand
seneschal of Normandy. Henri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of
seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union
seemed merely platonic, with Henri showing an intensely spiritual devotion
to Diane. But it soon became clear that he loved her in every way,
preferring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de’ Médicis.
In 1547 King Francis died and Henri ascended to the throne. This new
situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just turned forty-eight,
and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was
beginning to show her age; now that Henri was king, perhaps he would
return to the queen’s bed, and do as other kings had done—choose
mistresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of
Europe. He was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But
Diane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover, as
she had enthralled him for the past eleven years.
In the Middle Ages the symbolist attitude was much more in evidence. ...
Symbolism appears as a sort of short cut of thought. Instead of looking for
the relation between two things by following the hidden detours of their
causal connexions, thought makes a leap and discovers their relation not in
the connexion of cause and effects, but in a connexion of signification....
Symbolist thought permits an infinity of relations between things. Each
thing may denote a number of distinct ideas by its different special qualities,
and a quality may have several symbolic meanings. The highest conceptions
have symbols by the thousand. Nothing is too humble to represent and glory
the sublime. The walnut signifies Christ: the sweet kernel is His divine
nature, the green and pulpy outer peel is His humanity, the wooden shell
between is the cross. Thus all things raise his thoughts to the eternal....
Every precious stone, besides its natural splendour sparkles with the
brilliance of its symbolic values. The assimilation of roses and virginity is
much more than a poetic comparison, for it reveals their common essence.
As each notion arises in the mind the logic of symbolism creates an
harmony of ideas.
THE WANING OF THE MIDDLE AGES, JOHAN HUIZINGA, 1928
Diane’s secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had
always paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Henri, she had
created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their
union. The idea worked like a charm: Henri put this insignia everywhere—
on his royal robes, on monuments, on churches, on the facade of the
Louvre, then the royal palace in Paris. Diane’s favorite colors were black
and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the
insignia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its
meaning. Soon after Henri took the throne, however, Diane went still
further: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her
namesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime
and the particular passion of Henri. Equally important, in Renaissance art
she symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify
herself with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court,
giving her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her “chaste” relationship
with Henri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal
mistresses past.
To effect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her
castle at Anet. She razed the building’s structure and in its place erected a
magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was
made in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing
Diane’s trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and
Henri’s initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the
carpet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana—crescent moons, stags, and hounds
—adorned the gates and facade. Inside, enormous tapestries depicting
episodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls.
In the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which
is now in the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de
Poitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner
of the castle.
Anet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of Diane
de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared
together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them
with a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France’s
greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in
honor of Diana—indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by
the king’s mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane had given herself a kind
of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his
life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her—making her
a duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious
devotion to his first and only mistress.
Interpretation
Diane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, managed
to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was well
into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years. She
knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but a lover of the outdoors—
he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pennants,
brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women. Henri’s love
of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played on this
weakness of his at every opportunity.
Most astute of all was Diane’s appropriation of the goddess Diana. Here
she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psychic
symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king’s mistress into an emblem of
power and purity, but she managed it. Without the resonance of the goddess,
Diane was merely an aging courtesan. With the imagery and symbolism of
Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined for greatness.
You too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an
encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia.
Establish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game
further: Find an image or symbol from the past that will neatly fit your
situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem
larger than life.
There was a man named Sakamotoya Hechigwan who lived in upper
Kyoto.... When [Emperor] Hideyoshi gave his great Cha-no-yu [tea
ceremony] meeting at Kitano in the tenth month of 1588, Hechigwan set up
a great red umbrella nine feet across mounted on a stick seven feet high.
The circumference of the handle he surrounded for about two feet by a reed
fence in such a way that the rays of the sun were reflected from it and
diffused the colour of the umbrella all around. This device pleased
Hideyoshi so much that he remitted Hechigwan’s taxes as a reward.
 
CHA-NO-YU: THE JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY, A. L. SADLER, 1962
 
Because of the light it shines on the other stars which make up a kind of 
court around it, because of the just and equal distribution of its rays to 
all alike, because of the good it brings to all places, producing life, joy 
and action, because of its constancy from which it never varies, I chose 
the sun as the most magnificent image to represent a great leader.
 
Louis XIV, the Sun King, 1638-1715
KEYS TO POWER
Using words to plead your case is risky business: Words are dangerous
instruments, and often go astray. The words people use to persuade us
virtually invite us to reflect on them with words of our own; we mull them
over, and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part
of our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up
associations unintended by the speaker.
The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for
reflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable
thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the
healing powers of the moon, and about his own special connection to a
distant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was able to create a
compelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his
patients entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently
enough.
Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand,
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forceful
associations, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and
forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments and
divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential
instruments of power.
The symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of Diana)
or a verbal description of something visual (the words “the Sun King”). The
symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract (such as the
image “Diana” standing for chastity). The abstract concept—purity,
patriotism, courage, love—is full of emotional and powerful associations.
The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of meanings in
one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as explained by
Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is that its
associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his subjects,
distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of majesty
that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains untold
power.
The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the primacy
of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been argued, sight
and the other senses—taste, touch, and so on—operated on a relatively
equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to dominate the
others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Gracián said, “The
truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” When the Renaissance painter Fra
Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won his freedom
by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a piece of
charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly understood the
power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi go. That
one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist could have
made with words.
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color, for
example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yellow
Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was peddling, he
called it the “Red Letter Newsletter” and had it printed, at considerable
expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency, power, and good
fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to deception—as do
modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use “gold” in the title of
anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold. Since the eye
predominates, people will respond more to the color than to the word.
The visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor
Constantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day,
though, he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The
vision of the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of the new
religion, and he converted not just himself but the whole Roman Empire to
Christianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the
world could not have been as powerful. Find and associate yourself with the
images and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today,
and you will have untold power.
Most effective of all is a new combination—a fusion of images and
symbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their
association clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The
creation of new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic
effect—viewers’ associations run rampant, giving them a sense of
participation.
Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they
appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes
power; the image at the center seems to have central importance.
Near the end of World War II, orders came down from General
Eisenhower that American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its
liberation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however,
realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now
commanded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle
made certain that he an
