LAW 13
WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELF-
INTEREST, NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE
JUDGMENT
If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your
past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead,
uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will
benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond
enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In the early fourteenth century, a young man named Castruccio Castracani
rose from the rank of common soldier to become lord of the great city of
Lucca, Italy. One of the most powerful families in the city, the Poggios, had
been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded through treachery and
bloodshed), but after he came to power, they came to feel he had forgotten
them. His ambition outweighed any gratitude he felt. In 1325, while
Castruccio was away fighting Lucca’s main rival, Florence, the Poggios
conspired with other noble families in the city to rid themselves of this
troublesome and ambitious prince.
THE PEASANT AND THE APPLE-TREE
A peasant had in his garden an apple-tree, which bore no fruit, but only
served as a perch for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to cut it
down, and, taking his ax in hand, made a bold stroke at its roots. The
grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that
sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his
labors. He paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and
a third blow with his ax. When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a
hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his ax, and,
looking on the tree as isacred, took great care of it. Self-interest alone
moves some men.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
 
Mounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the
governor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke out,
and the Castruccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were poised to do
battle. At the height of the tension, however, Stefano di Poggio, the oldest
member of the family, intervened, and made both sides lay down their arms.
A peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He had told
his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he insisted he should
intercede on the family’s behalf and persuade Castruccio to listen to their
complaints and satisfy their demands. Stefano was the oldest and wisest
member of the clan, and his family agreed to put their trust in his diplomacy
rather than in their weapons.
When news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to
Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through
Stefano’s agency, and he was surprised by the city’s calm and peace.
Stefano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him
for his part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He
explained how he had brought peace, then begged for Castruccio’s mercy.
He said that the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for
power yet inexperienced; he recalled his family’s past generosity to
Castruccio. For all these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the
Poggios and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing
to do, since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always
supported him.
Castruccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or
resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail,
and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their
grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
later all were executed, including Stefano.
Interpretation
Stefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the
justice and nobility of their cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to justice
and gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than
not they have had dire consequences, especially in dealings with the
Castruccios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to power
through treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a
close and devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was told that it had
been a terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had
executed not an old friend but a new enemy.
A man like Castruccio knows only force and self-interest. When the
rebellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the most
dangerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made that fatal
mistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered money to
Castruccio, could have made promises for the future, could have pointed
out what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio’s power—their
influence with the most influential families of Rome, for example, and the
great marriage they could have brokered.
Instead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no obligation.
Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is often a terrible
burden that he gladly discards. And in this case Castruccio rid himself of his
obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios.
Most men are so thoroughly subjective that nothing really interests them but
themselves. They always think of their own case as soon as ever any remark
is made, and their whole attention is engrossed and absorbed by the merest
chance reference to anything which affects them personally, be it never so
remote.
 
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later
called Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood on the brink of
conflict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the
Athenians to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on
his side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give
the defeated side no mercy.
Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens’s
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra and
Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had come to Athens now out of
fear and concern for Corcyra’s safety. The only thing he could offer was an
alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in size and
strength by Athens’s own; an alliance between the two states would create a
formidable force, one that could intimidate the rival state of Sparta. That,
unfortunately, was all Corcyra had to offer.
The representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate speech,
in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran. He talked
of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked how it
would look to Athens’s other allies if the city put an agreement with a
former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served Athens’s
interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements with
Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to Hellenic
law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He finally went on
to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens, and the
importance of showing gratitude to one’s friends.
After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On the
second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and drop
Corinth.
Interpretation
History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preeminent
realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emotional
appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument,
especially one that added to their power.
What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his references to
Corinth’s past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians, subtly
asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The Athenians
couldn’t care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the same time,
they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for abandoning
Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their ties to
Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by force,
and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.
When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the
future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.
As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a
pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmatic—they
will rarely act against their own self-interest.
It has always been a rule that the weak should be subject to the strong; 
and besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up till the 
present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after 
calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right 
and wrong. Considerations of this kind have never yet turned people aside 
from the opportunities of aggrandizement offered by superior strength.
Athenian representative to Sparta, 
quoted in The Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, c. 465-395 B.C.
KEYS TO POWER
In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of
asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to
asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person
you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely trapped
in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption that the
people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping them. They
talk as if their needs mattered to these people—who probably couldn’t care
less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or grand emotions
such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture when simple,
everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they do not realize
is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs of his own, and
that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely sees you as
desperate or, at best, a waste of time.
In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to
convert the people of Japan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal
had a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe. Although the
missionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling
elite; by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing
had completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in Japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion—the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practical-minded Dutch.
Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a
timeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal with is
like another culture, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and him by
appealing to his self-interest. Do not be subtle: You have valuable
knowledge to share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make him
live longer and happier. This is a language that all of us speak and
understand.
A key step in the process is to understand the other person’s psychology.
Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing? Does
he have enemies you could help him vanquish? Is he simply motivated by
money and power?
When the Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they threatened
to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years. Their
leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but a country that lacked
pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, leveling all its
cities, for “it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let the grass
grow.” It was not a soldier, a general, or a king who saved the Chinese from
devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch‘u-Ts’ai. A foreigner himself, Ch‘u-
Ts’ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese culture. He
managed to make himself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and persuaded
him that he would reap riches out of the place if, instead of destroying it, he
simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wisdom in this and
did as Ch‘u-Ts’ai advised.
When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to
massacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted him),
Ch‘u-Ts’ai told him that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was
spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it
really wasn’t mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch‘u-Ts’ai knew Khan well. He
was a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culture, or indeed for
anything other than warfare and practical results. Ch‘u-Ts’ai chose to appeal
to the only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.
Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them see
how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause, their
resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each step on
the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your way
inside the other person’s mind, to see their needs and interests, to get rid of
the screen of your own feelings that obscure the truth. Master this art and
there will be no limits to what you can accomplish.

1645-1696)
REVERSAL
Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble.
They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice, which
are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for help, you
emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to need
nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine that
intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce you to
powerful people—provided, of course, that all this is done in public, and for
a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone, then, can
be approached through cynical self-interest. Some people will be put off by
it, because they don’t want to seem to be motivated by such things. They
need opportunities to display their good heart.
Do not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It’s not as if you are conning
them by asking for help—it is really their pleasure to give, and to be seen
giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people and
figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, do not appeal to
their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, do not appeal to
their greed.
