LAW 28
ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS
JUDGMENT
If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and
hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter
with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily
corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors
the timid.
THE TWO ADVENTURERS
The path of pleasure never leads to glory! The prodigious achievements of
Hercules were the result of high adventure, and though there is little, either
in fable or history, to show that he had any rivals, still it is recorded that a
knight errant, in company with a fellow adventurer, sought his fortune in a
romantic country. He had not traveled far when his companion observed a
post, on which was written the following inscription: “Brave adventurer, if
you have a desire to discover that which has never been seen by any knight
errant, you have only to pass this torrent, and then take in your arms an
elephant of stone and carry it in one breath to the summit of this mountain,
whose noble head seems blended with the sky.” “But,” said the knight’s
companion, “the water may be deep as well as rapid, and though,
notwithstanding, we should pass it, why should we be encumbered with the
elephant? What a ridiculous undertaking!” And philosophically and with
nice calculation, he observed that the elephant might be carried four steps;
but for conveying it to the top of the mountain in one breath, that was not in
the power of a mortal, unless it should be the dwarf figure of an elephant, fit
only to be placed on the top of a stick; and then what honor would there be
in such an adventure? “There is,” said he, “some deception in this writing.
It is an enigma only fit to amuse a child. I shall therefore leave you and
your elephant.”
The reasoner then departed; but the adventurous man rushed with his eyes
closed across the water; neither depth nor violence prevented him. and
according to the inscription he saw the elephant lying on the opposite bank.
He took it and carried it to the top of the hill, where he saw a town. A shriek
from the elephant alarmed the people of the city, who rose in arms; but the
adventurer, nothing daunted, was determined to die a hero. The people,
however, were awed by his presence, and he was astonished to hear them
proclaim him successor to their king, who had recently died. Great
enterprises are only achieved by adventurous spirits. They who calculate
with too great nicety every difficulty and obstacle which is likely to lie in
their way, lose that time in hesitation, which the more daring seize and
render available to the loftiest purposes.
 
FABLES, JEAN DE LA FONTAINE, 1621-1695
BOLDNESS AND HESITATION: A Brief Psychological Comparison
Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological responses in their
targets: Hesitation puts obstacles in your path, boldness eliminates them.
Once you understand this, you will find it essential to overcome your
natural timidity and practice the art of audacity. The following are among
the most pronounced psychological effects of boldness and timidity.
 
The Bolder the Lie the Better. We all have weaknesses, and our efforts are
never perfect. But entering action with boldness has the magical effect of
hiding our deficiencies. Con artists know that the bolder the lie, the more
convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of the story makes it more
credible, distracting attention from its inconsistencies. When putting
together a con or entering any kind of negotiation, go further than you
planned. Ask for the moon and you will be surprised how often you get it.
 
Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the
weaknesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your
willingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the lion
even in people who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. Everything depends on
perception, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes
on the defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be
pushed around without mercy.
 
Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move makes
you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly, with
the stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By
intimidating with a bold move, you establish a precedent: in every
subsequent encounter, people will be on the defensive, in terror of your next
strike.
 
Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you enter an
action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your own
path. When a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options where
there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Retreating
from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares.
 
Hesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. When you take
time to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to
think as well. Your timidity infects people with awkward energy, elicits
embarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.
Boldness destroys such gaps. The swiftness of the move and the energy
of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In seduction,
hesitation is fatal—it makes your victim conscious of your intentions. The
bold move crowns seduction with triumph: It leaves no time for reflection.
 
Audacity Separates You from the Herd. Boldness gives you presence and
makes you seem larger than life. The timid fade into the wallpaper, the bold
draw attention, and what draws attention draws power. We cannot keep our
eyes off the audacious—we cannot wait to see their next bold move.
OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW
Observance I
In May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French scrap-
metal business found themselves invited to an “official” but “highly
confidential” meeting with the deputy director general of the Ministry of
Post and Telegraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most luxurious hotel in
Paris. When the businessmen arrived, it was the director general himself, a
Monsieur Lustig, who met them in a swank suite on the top floor.
The businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to this
meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. After drinks, the director
explained. “Gentlemen,” he said, “this is an urgent matter that requires
complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear down the Eiffel
Tower.” The dealers listened in stunned silence as the director explained
that the tower, as recently reported in the news, desperately needed repairs.
It had originally been meant as a temporary structure (for the Exposition of
1889), its maintenance costs had soared over the years, and now, in a time
of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to fix it.
Many Parisians considered the Eiffel Tower an eyesore and would be
delighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would forget about it—it
would live on in photographs and postcards. “Gentlemen,” Lustig said,
“you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.”
He gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with
figures, such as the tonnage of the tower’s metal. Their eyes popped as they
calculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led them
to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel Tower. Flashing an
official badge, he guided them through the area, spicing his tour with
amusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit he thanked them and asked them
to have their offers delivered to his suite within four days.
Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Monsieur
P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the sale he
should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a certified
check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about
$1,000,000)—a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he
would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower.
Monsieur P. was excited—he would go down in history as the man who had
bought and torn down the infamous landmark. But by the time he arrived at
the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about the whole
affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building? Why hadn’t
he heard from other officials? Was this a hoax, a scam? As he listened to
Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, he hesitated,
and contemplated backing out.
Suddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his tone.
Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his low salary,
about his wife’s desire for a fur coat, about how galling it was to work hard
and be unappreciated. It dawned on Monsieur P. that this high government
official was asking for a bribe. The effect on him, though, was not outrage
but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig was for real, since in all of his
previous encounters with French bureaucrats, they had inevitably asked for
a little greasing of the palm. His confidence restored, Monsieur P. slipped
the director several thousand francs in bills, then handed him the certified
check. In return he received the documentation, including an impressive-
looking bill of sale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and fame to
come.
Over the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for
correspondence from the government, he began to realize that something
was amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there was no deputy
director general Lustig, and there were no plans to destroy the Eiffel Tower:
He had been bilked of over 250,000 francs!
Monsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of reputation he
would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the most absurdly
audacious cons in history. Besides the public humiliation, it would have
been business suicide.
Interpretation
Had Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de
Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one would have
believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, too improbable to be
part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return
to Paris six months later and “resell” the Eiffel Tower to a different scrap-
iron dealer, and for a higher price—a sum in francs equivalent today to over
$1,500,000!
Largeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us, and
is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion or deception
afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness—stretch your deceptions as
far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker has
suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or
lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and
getting a bribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts
out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its
boldness.
Always set to work without misgivings on the score of imprudence. Fear of
failure in the mind of a performer is, for an onlooker, already evidence of
failure.... Actions are dangerous when there is doubt as to their wisdom; it
would be safer to do nothing.
BALTASAR GRACIÁN, 1601-1658
THE STORY OF HUH SAENG
In a lowly thatched cottage in the Namsan Valley there lived a poor couple,
Mr. and Mrs. Huh Saeng. The husband confined himself for seven years and
only read books in his cold room.... One day his wife, all in tears, said to
him: “Look here, my good man! What is the use of all your book reading? I
have spent my youth in washing and sewing for other people and yet I have
no spare jacket or skirt to wear and I have had no food to eat during the
past three days. I am hungry and cold. I can stand it no more!” ... Hearing
these words, the middle-aged scholar closed his book... rose to his feet
and... without saying another word, he went out of doors.... Arriving in the
heart of the city, he slopped a passing gentleman. “Hello, my friend! Who is
the richest man in town?” “Poor countryman! Don’t you know Byôn-ssi, the
millionaire? His glittering tile-roofed house pierced by twelve gates is just
over there.” Huh Saeng bent his steps to the rich man’s house. Having
entered the big gate, he flung the guest-room door open and addressed the
host:“I need 10,000 yang for capital for my commercial business and I
want you to lend me the money.” “Alright, sir. Where shall I send the
money?”
“To the Ansông Market in care of a commission merchant.” “Very well. sir.
I will draw on Kim, who does the biggest commission business in the
Ansông Market. You’ll get the money there.” “Good-bye. sir.” When Huh
Saeng was gone, all the other guests in the room asked Byôn-ssi why he
gave so much money to a beggarlike stranger whose family name was
unknown to him. But the rich man replied with a triumphant face: “Even
though he was in ragged clothes, he spoke clearly to the point without
betraying shame or inferiority, unlike common people who want to borrow
money for a bad debt. Such a man as he is either mad or self-confident in
doing business. But judging from his dauntless eyes and booming voice he
is an uncommon man with a superhuman brain, worthy of my trust. I know
money and I know men. Money often makes a man small, but a man like him
makes big money. I am only glad to have helped a big man do big
business.”
BEHIND THE SCENES OF ROYAL PALACES IN KOREA, HA TAE-
HUNG, 1983
Observance II
On his deathbed in 1533, Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow and ruler
of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son, Ivan IV, as his
successor. He appointed his young wife, Helena, as regent until Ivan
reached his majority and could rule on his own. The aristocracy—the
boyars—secretly rejoiced: For years the dukes of Moscow had been trying
to extend their authority over the boyars’ turf. With Vasily dead, his heir a
mere three years old, and a young woman in charge of the dukedom, the
boyars would be able to roll back the dukes’ gains, wrest control of the
state, and humiliate the royal family.
Aware of these dangers, young Helena turned to her trusted friend Prince
Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent she suddenly
died—poisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the most fearsome
boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the government and threw
Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age of eight, Ivan
was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family member who took an
interest in him was immediately banished or killed.
And so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in hiding
from the Shuiskys, who treated him roughly when they saw him. On some
days they would search him out, clothe him in royal robes, hand him a
scepter, and set him on the throne—a kind of mock ritual in which they
lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo him away. One
evening several of them chased the Metropolitan—the head of the Russian
church—through the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan’s room; the boy
watched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the
Metropolitan mercilessly.
Ivan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who
consoled and advised him. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the
newest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys
burst in, beat up Uorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by tearing and
treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow.
Throughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars it
seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had turned into a
terrified and obedient idiot. They could ignore him now, even leave him
alone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked
Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the
room was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan then pointed his finger at
Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest him, have him killed, and throw his
body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days Ivan
had all of Andrei’s close associates arrested and banished. Caught off-guard
by his sudden boldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this youth,
the future Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five years to
execute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for decades
to come.
Interpretation
The world is full of boyars — men who despise you, fear your ambition,
and jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You need to establish
your authority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your
growing boldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a
situation: He lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited,
and when the time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The
guards had come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan’s
plan, he struck with the swiftness of a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky
and giving him no time to react.
Negotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for him. A small
compromise becomes the toehold he needs to tear you apart. The sudden
bold move, without discussion or warning, obliterates these toeholds, and
builds your authority. You terrify doubters and despisers and gain the
confidence of the many who admire and glorify those who act boldly.
Observance III
In 1514 the twenty-two-year-old Pietro Aretino was working as a lowly
assistant scullion to a wealthy Roman family. He had ambitions of greatness
as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how could a mere
lackey hope to realize such dreams?
That year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an embassy that
included many gifts, most prominent among them a great elephant, the first
in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored this elephant and
showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his love and care, the
elephant, which was called Hanno, became deathly ill. The pope summoned
doctors, who administered a five-hundred-pound purgative to the elephant,
but all to no avail. The animal died and the pope went into mourning. To
console himself he summoned the great painter Raphael and ordered him to
create a life-sized painting of Hanno above the animal’s tomb, bearing the
inscription, “What nature took away, Raphael has with his art restored.”
Over the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome that
caused great merriment and laughter. Entitled “The Last Will and Testament
of the Elephant Hanno,” it read, in part, “To my heir the Cardinal Santa
Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my genuflections.... To my
heir Cardinal Santi Quattro, I give my jaws, so that he can more readily
devour all of Christ’s revenues.... To my heir Cardinal Medici, I give my
ears, so that he can hear everyone’s doings....” To Cardinal Grassi, who had
a reputation for lechery, the elephant bequeathed the appropriate, oversized
part of his own anatomy.
On and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great in
Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best-known
weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, “See to it that Aretino is your
friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words alone could ruin the high
pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue.”
Interpretation
With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant
himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who
this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought
him out and ended up giving him a job in the papal service. Over the years
he came to be known as the “Scourge of Princes,” and his biting tongue
earned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of France to the
Hapsburg emperor.
Fear, which always magnifies objects, gives a body to all their fancies,
which takes for its form whatever they conceive to exist in their enemies’
