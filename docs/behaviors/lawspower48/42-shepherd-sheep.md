LAW 42
STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER
JUDGMENT
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual —the stirrer, the
arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such people room
to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the
troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them—they are
irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them.
Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
Near the end of the sixth century B.C., the city-state of Athens overthrew
the series of petty tyrants who had dominated its politics for decades. It
established instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a
democracy that became the source of its power and its proudest
achievement. But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the
Athenians had never faced: How to deal with those who did not concern
themselves with the cohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who
did not work for its greater glory, but thought of only themselves and their
own ambitions and petty intrigues? The Athenians understood that these
people, if left alone, would sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and
stir up anxieties, all of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy.
Violent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that Athens
had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying, and less
brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they would
gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an ostrakon,
the name of an individual they wanted to see banished from the city for ten
years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots, that person
would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand votes, the person
with the most ostraka recording his name would suffer the ten-year
“ostracism.” This ritual expulsion became a kind of festival—what a joy to
be able to banish those irritating, anxiety-inducing individuals who wanted
to rise above the group they should have served.
In 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian history,
helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the
battlefield, his fairness as a judge had earned him the nickname “The Just.”
But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike him. He made such a
show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised his feelings of
superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipresence in Athenian
politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of hearing him called
“The Just.” They feared that this was just the type of man—judgmental,
haughty—who would eventually stir up fierce divisions among them. In
482 B.C., despite Aristides’ invaluable expertise in the continuing war with
the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had him banished.
After Aristides’ ostracism, the great general Themistocles emerged as the
city’s premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his head,
and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding the
Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dangers he
had fended off. He seemed to be saying that without him the city would
come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Themistocles’ name was filled in on the
ostraka and the city was rid of his poisonous presence.
THE CONQUEST OF PERU
The struggle now became fiercer than ever around the royal litter [of
Atahualpa, king of the Incan empire]. It reeled more and more, and at
length, several of the nobles who supported it having been slain, it was
overturned, and the Indian prince would have come with violence to the
ground, had not his fall been broken by the efforts of Pizarro and some
other of the cavaliers, who caught him in their arms. The imperial borla
was instantly snatched from his temples by a soldier. and the unhappy
monarch, strongly secured, was removed to a neighboring building where
he was carefully guarded.
All attempt at resistance now ceased. The fate of the Inca [Atahualpa] soon
spread over town and country. The charm that might have held the
Peruvians together was dissolved. Every man thought only of his own
safety. Even the [Incan] soldiery encamped on the adjacent fields took the
alarm, and, learning the fatal tidings, were seen flying in every direction
before their pursuers, who in the heat of triumph showed no touch of mercy.
At length night, more pitiful than man, threw her friendly mantle over the
fugitives, and the scattered troops of Pizarro rallied once more at the sound
of the trumpet in the bloody square of Cajamarca.... [Atahualpa] was
reverenced as more than a human. He was not merely the head of the state,
but the point to which all its institutions converged as to a common center -
the keystone of the political fabric which must fall to pieces by its own
weight when that was withdrawn. So it fared on the [execution] of
Atahualpa. His death not only left the throne vacant, without any certain
successor, but the manner of it announced to the Peruvian people that a
hand stronger than that of their Incas had now seized the scepter, and that
the dynasty of the Children of the Sun had passed away forever.
THE CONQUEST OF PERU, WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT, 1847
The greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly
Pericles. Although several times threatened with ostracism, he avoided that
fate by maintaining close ties with the people. Perhaps he had learned a
lesson as a child from his favorite tutor, the incomparable Damon, who
excelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical skills, and
his rhetorical abilities. It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the arts of
ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his insulting
manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment.
Toward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus.
Most writers of the time describe him as the city’s most worthless citizen:
He did not care what anyone thought of him, and slandered whomever he
disliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C.,
Hyperbolus saw an opportunity to stir up anger against the two leading
politicians of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two
would be ostracized and that he would rise in that man’s place. His
campaign seemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades’
flamboyant and carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias’ wealth and
aloofness. They seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades
and Nicias, although they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources
and managed to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His
obnoxiousness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment.
Earlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powerful men.
Hyperbolus, however, was a low buffoon, and with his banishment the
Athenians felt that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the
practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keeping
the peace within Athens.
Interpretation
The ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown today—the passage of
centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the
Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how such
behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-than-thou attitude
that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening ambition
at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority; quiet
scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would eat
away at the city’s cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension,
others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen feel
inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people who
acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to
impose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The
solution was quick and effective: Get rid of them.
Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source, the
unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissension and
infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit you the
dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disentangle one
strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing started. First,
recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or by their
complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform them or
appease them—that will only make things worse. Do not attack them,
whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and will
work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish them
before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they become the
eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties and sow
discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suffer so that
the rest can live in peace.
When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter.
Chinese saying
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new
pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd; such
a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boniface
VIII, Gaetani soon proved he deserved the cardinals’high opinion of him:
He plotted his moves carefully in advance, and stopped at nothing to get his
way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and unified the
Papal States. The European powers began to fear him, and sent delegates to
negotiate with him. The German King Albrecht of Austria even yielded
some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to the pope’s
plan.
One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the
richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany’s most
powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud republic,
and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully.
Florence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites.
The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly risen
to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of their
popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to the
Blacks’ increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily
more bitter.
THE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP
Once upon a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the sheep, desiring that
there might be peace between them for the time to come. “Why,” said they,
“should we be for ever waging this deadly strife? Those wicked dogs are
the cause of all; they are incessantly barking at us, and provoking us. Send
them away, and there will be no longer any obstacle to our eternal
friendship and peace.” The silly sheep listened, the dogs were dismissed,
and the flock, thus deprived of their best protectors, became an easy prey to
their treacherous enemy.
 
FABLES, AESOP, SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
 
Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take
over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the
situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated
writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be
the city’s most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began
plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante’s fellow citizens had voted him in to
Florence’s highest elected position, making him one of the city’s six priors.
During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the
Blacks and against all of the pope’s attempts to sow disorder.
By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to
Tuscany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally
the people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working
desperately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against the pope
and his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had to
neutralize Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence
with Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the
possibility of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed
the Florentines decided to send a delegation to Rome and try to negotiate a
peace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante.
Some warned the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure him
away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army stood
before the gates of Florence. He felt sure that his eloquence and reason
would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the pope met the poet
and the Florentine delegates, he instantly intimidated them, as he did so
many. “Fall on your knees before me!” he bellowed at their first meeting.
“Submit to me! I tell you that in all truth I have nothing in my heart but to
promote your peace.” Succumbing to his powerful presence, the Florentines
listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He then advised
them to return home, leaving one of their members behind to continue the
talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be Dante. He spoke
with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order.
And so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope continued
their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites, and with
Charles de Valois using the pope’s money to bribe and sow dissension, the
Whites disintegrated, some arguing for negotiations, others switching sides.
Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the Blacks easily
destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on them. And once
the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dismissed Dante from
Rome.
The Blacks ordered Dante to return home to face accusations and stand
trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned him to be burned to
death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante began a miserable
life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in the city that he loved,
never to return to Florence, even after his death.
THE LIFE OF THEMISTOCLES
[Themistocles‘s] fellow citizens reached the point at which their jealousy
made them listen to any slander at his expense, and so [he] was forced to
remind the assembly of his achievements until they could bear this no
longer. He once said to those who were complaining of him: “Why are you
tired of receiving benefits so often from the same men?” Besides this he
gave offense to the people when he built the temple of Artemis, for not only
did he style the goddess Artemis Aristoboule, or Artemis wisest in counsel
—with the hint that it was he who had given the best counsel to the
Athenians and the Greeks-but he chose a site for it near his own house at
Melite... So at last the Athenians banished him. They made use of the
ostracism to humble his great reputation and his authority, as indeed was
their habit with any whose power they regarded as oppressive, or who had
risen to an eminence which they considered out of keeping with the equality
of a democracy.
THE LIFE OF THEMISTOCLES, PLUTARCH, C. A.D. 46-120
Interpretation
Boniface knew that if he only had a pretext to lure Dante away, Florence
would crumble. He played the oldest card in the book—threatening with
one hand while holding out the olive branch with the other—and Dante fell
for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept him there for as long as it
took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the game of
power: One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a flock of sheep
into a den of lions. So he isolated the troublemaker. Without the backbone
of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly scattered.
Learn the lesson: Do not waste your time lashing out in all directions at
what seems to be a many-headed enemy. Find the one head that matters—
the person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all, charisma.
Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is absent his
powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical (banishment or
absence from the court), political (narrowing his base of support), or
psychological (alienating him from the group through slander and
insinuation). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads
beyond cure.
KEYS TO POWER
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries,
power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized.
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no longer
have centers of power—that power is spread out and scattered among many
people. Actually, however, power has changed in its numbers but not in its
essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants commanding the power of life
and death over millions, but there remain thousands of petty tyrants ruling
smaller realms, and enforcing their will through indirect power games,
charisma, and so on. In every group, power is concentrated in the hands of
one or two people, for this is one area in which human nature will never
change: People will congregate around a single strong personality like
planets orbiting a sun.
To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer exists
is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit the target.
Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play along with the
game—pretending that power is shared among many—but inwardly they
keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold the cards. These
are the ones they work on. When troubles arise, they look for the underlying
cause, the single strong character who started the stirring and whose
isolation or banishment will settle the waters again.
In his family-therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if the
family dynamic was unsettled and dysfunctional there was inevitably one
person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating him or her apart from the
others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you
recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish
a great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising
their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible and
they lose their power to upset.
A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power. In
chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to
isolate the enemy’s forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and
ineffectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy them—
you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the game of
power, isolation spells death.
The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your victims
from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to eliminate an enemy
in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; he silently and
stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn them away
from him, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on his own.
Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To
seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly
present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the
charm will wear off. Queen Elizabeth’s prime minister, Robert Cecil, had
two main rivals: the queen’s favorite, the Earl of
