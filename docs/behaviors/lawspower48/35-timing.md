LAW 35
MASTER THE ART OF TIMING
JUDGMENT
Never seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack of control over
yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything
will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff
out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to
stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has
reached fruition.
SERTORIUS’S LESSON
Sertorius’s strength was now rapidly increasing, for all the tribes between
the Ebro and the Pyrenees came over to his side, and troops came flocking
daily to join him from every quarter. At the same time he was troubled by
the lack of discipline and the overconfidence of these newly arrived
barbarians, who would shout at him to attack the enemy and had no
patience with his delaying tactics, and he therefore tried to win them over
by argument. But when he saw that they were discontented and persisted in
pressing their demands regardless of the circumstances, he let them have
their way and allowed them to engage the enemy; he hoped that they would
suffer a severe defeat without being completely crushed, and that this would
make them better disposed to obey his orders in future. The event turned out
as he expected and Sertorius came to their rescue, provided a rallying point
for the fugitives, and led them safely back to his camp. His next step was to
revive their dejected spirits, and so a few days later he summoned a general
assembly. Before it he produced two horses, one of them old and enfeebled,
the other large and lusty and possessing a flowing tail, which was
remarkable for the thickness and beauty of its hair. By the side of the weak
horse stood a tall strong man, and by the side of the powerful horse a short
man of mean physique. At a signal the strong man seized the tail of his
horse and tried with all his strength to pull it towards him, as if to tear it
off, while the weak man began to pull the hairs one by one from the tail of
the strong horse.
The strong man, after tugging with all his might to no purpose and causing
the spectators a great deal of amusement in the process, finally gave up the
attempt, while the weak man quickly and with very little trouble stripped his
horse’s tail completely bare. Then Sertorius rose to his feet and said, “Now
you can see, my friends and allies, that perseverance is more effective than
brute strength and that there are many difficulties that cannot be overcome
if you try to do everything at once, but which will yield if you master them
little by little. The truth is that a steady continuous effort is irresistible, for
this is the way in which Time captures and subdues the greatest powers on
earth. Now Time, you should remember, is a good friend and ally to those
who use their intelligence to choose the right moment, but a most dangerous
enemy to those who rush into action at the wrong one.”
 
LIFE OF SERTORIUS, PLUTARCH, C.A.D. 46-120
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Starting out in life as a nondescript French seminary-school teacher, Joseph
Fouché wandered from town to town for most of the decade of the 1780s,
teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he never completely committed
himself to the church, never took his vows as a priest—he had bigger plans.
Patiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the
French Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouché waited no longer: He got rid
of his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was
the spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have
spelt disaster. Fouché did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary
leader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of
Nantes elected Fouché to be its representative to the National Convention
(created that year to frame a new constitution for a French republic).
When Fouché arrived in Paris to take his seat at the convention, a violent
rift had broken out between the moderates and the radical Jacobins. Fouché
sensed that in the long run neither side would emerge victorious. Power
rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even of those
who further it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion. That was
the side Fouché wanted to be on.
His sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moderates
were in the majority. When the time came to decide on whether or not to
execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people were clamoring for the
king’s head, so he cast the deciding vote—for the guillotine. Now he had
become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the boil in Paris, he foresaw the
danger of being too closely associated with any one faction, so he accepted
a position in the provinces, where he could lie low for a while. A few
months later he was assigned to the post of proconsul in Lyons, where he
oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment,
however, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the
country was turning-and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens
of Lyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror.
So far Fouché had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old friend
Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons.
Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent heads
on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouché, whom he no longer
trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over the next few weeks,
a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed openly against Fouché,
accusing of him dangerous ambitions and calling for his arrest, the crafty
Fouché worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support among those who
were beginning to tire of Robespierre’s dictatorial control. Fouché was
playing for time. He knew that the longer he survived, the more disaffected
citizens he could rally against Robespierre. He had to have broad support
before he moved against the powerful leader. He rallied support among both
the moderates and the Jacobins, playing on the widespread fear of
Robespierre-everyone was afraid of being the next to go to the guillotine. It
all came to fruition on July 27: The convention turned against Robespierre,
shouting down his usual lengthy speech. He was quickly arrested, and a few
days later it was Robespierre’s head, not Fouché’s, that fell into the basket.
When Fouché returned to the convention after Robespierre’s death, he
played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy against
Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but lo and behold,
he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the
first time in his life he aligned himself with the minority. Clearly he sensed
a reaction stirring: He knew that the moderate faction that had executed
Robespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round
of the Terror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the Jacobins,
then, Fouché was sitting with the martyrs of the days to come—the people
who would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way.
Taking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky
gambit, of course, but Fouché must have calculated he could keep his head
long enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and watch
them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call for his
arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent him to the guillotine, too
much time had passed. The executions had become unpopular with the
people, and Fouché survived the swing of the pendulum one more time.
A new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however, a
Jacobin government, but a moderate one—more moderate than the
government that had reimposed the Terror. Fouché, the radical, had kept his
head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the
sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings
against him, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he had
a new passion: intelligence-gathering. He became a paid spy for the
government, excelled at the job, and in 1799 was rewarded by being made
minister of police. Now he was not just empowered but required to extend
his spying to every corner of France—a responsibility that would greatly
reinforce his natural ability to sniff out where the wind was blowing. One of
the first social trends he detected, in fact, came in the person of Napoleon, a
brash young general whose destiny he right away saw was entwined with
the future of France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d‘etat, on
November 9, 1799, Fouché pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the
whole day. For this indirect assistance—it might have been thought his job,
after all, to prevent a military coup—Napoleon kept him on as minister of
police in the new regime.
Over the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouché more and
more. He even gave this former revolutionary a title, duke of Otranto, and
rewarded him with great wealth. By 1808, however, Fouché, always attuned
to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the downswing. His futile war
with Spain, a country that posed no threat to France, was a sign that he was
losing a sense of proportion. Never one to be caught on a sinking ship,
Fouché conspired with Talleyrand to bring about Napoleon’s downfall.
Although the conspiracy failed—Talleyrand was fired; Fouché stayed, but
was kept on a tight leash—it publicized a growing discontent with the
emperor, who seemed to be losing control. By 1814 Napoleon’s power had
crumbled and allied forces finally conquered him.
The next government was a restoration of the monarchy, in the form of
King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouché, his nose always sniffing
the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long—he had
none of Napoleon’s flair. Fouché once again played his waiting game, lying
low, staying away from the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815,
Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned.
Louis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were
clamoring for Napoleon’s return. So Louis turned to the one man who could
maybe have saved his hide, Fouché, the former radical who had sent his
brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most popular
and widely admired politicians in France. Fouché, however, would not side
with a loser: He refused Louis’s request for help by pretending that his help
was unnecessary—by swearing that Napoleon would never return to power
(although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course, Napoleon and
his new citizen army were closing in on Paris.
Seeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouché had betrayed him,
and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on Napoleon’s
team, King Louis ordered the minister’s arrest and execution. On March 16,
1815, policemen surrounded Fouché’s coach on a Paris boulevard. Was this
finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately: Fouché told the police that an
ex-member of government could not be arrested on the street. They fell for
the story and allowed him to return home. Later that day, though, they came
to his house and once again declared him under arrest. Fouché nodded—but
would the officers be so kind as allow a gentleman to wash and to change
his clothes before leaving his house for the last time? They gave their
permission, Fouché left the room, and the minutes went by. Fouché did not
return. Finally the policemen went into the next room—where they saw a
ladder against an open window, leading down to the garden below.
That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouché, but by then
Napoleon’s cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the
king’s men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouché
came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon
greeted his former minister of police and gladly restored him to his old post.
During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Waterloo, it
was essentially Fouché who governed France. After Napoleon fell, Louis
XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fouché stayed
on to serve in yet another government—by then his power and influence
had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge him.
Mr. Shih had two sons: one loved learning; the other war. The first
expounded his moral teachings at the admiring court of Ch‘i and was made
a tutor, while the second talked strategy at the bellicose court of Ch’u and
was made a general. The impecunious Mr. Meng, hearing of these
successes, sent his own two sons out to follow the example of the Shih boys.
The first expounded his moral teachings at the court of Ch‘in, but the King
of Ch’in said: “At present the states are quarreling violently and every
prince is busy arming his troops to the teeth. If I followed this prig’s
pratings we should soon be annihilated.” So he had the fellow castrated.
Meanwhile, the second brother displayed his military genius at the court of
Wei. But the King of Wei said: “Mine is a weak state. If I relied on force
instead of diplomacy, we should soon be wiped out. If, on the other hand, I
let this fire-eater go, he will offer his services to another state and then we
shall be in trouble.” So he had the fellow’s feet cut off Both. families did
exactly the same thing, but one timed it right, the other wrong. Thus success
depends not on ratiocination but on rhythm.
LIEH TZU, QUOTED IN THE CHINESE LOOKING GLASS, DENNIS
BLOODWORTH, 1967
Interpretation
In a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouché thrived through his
mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons.
First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouché always
looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry him to power, and
rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and turns,
and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure:
Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies
hidden and dormant. Look forward to the Napoleons of the future rather
than holding on to the ruins of the past.
Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean
running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful
reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouché
did after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride the cresting wave of
the moment, wait for the tide’s ebb to carry you back to power. Upon
occasion bet on the reaction that is brewing, and place yourself in the
vanguard of it.
Finally, Fouché had remarkable patience. Without patience as your sword
and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself a
loser. When the times were against Fouché, he did not struggle, get
emotional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low
profile, patiently building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his
next rise to power. Whenever he found himself in the weaker position, he
played for time, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient.
Recognize the moment, then, to hide in the grass or slither under a rock, as
well as the moment to bare your fangs and attack.
Space we can recover, time never.
Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821
KEYS TO POWER
Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the
limitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. Since
we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it to some
degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, with vast
expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. Time, then,
depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully altered. This is the
first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil
caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, it follows that once
we control our emotional responses to events, time will move much more
slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to lengthen our
perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and anger close
off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement in the art of
timing.
The sultan [of Persia] had sentenced two men to death. One of them,
knowing how much the sultan loved his stallion, offered to teach the horse
to fly within a year in return for his life. The sultan, fancying himself as the
rider of the only flying horse in the world, agreed. The other prisoner
looked at his friend in disbelief “You know horses don’t fly. What made you
come up with a crazy idea like that? You’re only postponing the inevitable.”
“Not so,” said the (first prisoner]. “I have actually given myself four
chances for freedom. First, the sultan might die during the year. Second, I
might die. Third, the horse might die. And fourth ... I might teach the horse
to fly!”
THE CRAFT OF POWER, R.G.H. SIU, 1979
There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents problems
that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the
drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed with patience and
gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defensive—
this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity.
Next there is forced time: the short-term time that we can manipulate as an
offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our opponents. Finally there is
end time, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have
waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate.
 
Long Time. The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou Yung
relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter afternoon
he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He
was bringing some important books and papers with him and had
commissioned a young boy to help him carry them. As the ferry neared the
other side of the river, Chou Yung asked the boatman if they would have
time to get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mile away and
night was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle
of loosely tied papers and books—“Yes,” he replied, “if you do not walk too
fast.”
As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being locked
out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy walked
faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string around the
papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It took them many
minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time they had reached
the city gates, it was too late.
When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest of
problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if you
had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but
papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in
constant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created.
Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is your best move—you wait,
you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present
opportunities you had not imagined.
Waiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but those of
your colleagues, who, mistaking action for power, may try to push you into
making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage
this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you
stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick
up the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great early-
seventeenth-century emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his
predecessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged
a rash invasion of Korea, Ieyasu did not involve himself. He knew the
