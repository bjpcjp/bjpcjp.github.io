LAW 30
MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS
JUDGMENT
Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and
practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed.
When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the
temptation of revealing how hard you work—it only raises questions. Teach
no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
KANO TANNYU, MASTER ARTIST
Date Masamune once sent for Tannyu to decorate a pair of gold screens
seven feet high. The artist said he thought black-and-white sketches would
suit them, and went home again after considering them carefully. The next
morning he came early and made a large quantity of ink into which he
dipped a horseshoe he had brought with him, and then proceeded to make
impressions of this all over one of the screens. Then, with a large brush, he
drew a number of lines across them. Meanwhile Masamune had come in to
watch his work, and at this he could contain his irritation no longer, and
muttering, “What a beastly mess!” he strode away to his own apartments.
The retainers told Tannyu he was in a very bad temper indeed. “He
shouldn’t look on while I am at work, then,” replied the painter, “he should
wait till it is finished.” Then he took up a smaller brush and dashed in
touches here and there, and as he did so the prints of the horse-shoe turned
into crabs, while the big broad strokes became rushes. He then turned to the
other screen and splashed drops of ink all over it, and when he had added a
few brush-strokes here and there they became a flight of swallows over
willow trees. When Masamune saw the finished work he was as overjoyed at
the artist’s skill as he had previously been annoyed at the apparent mess he
was making of the screens.
CHA-NO-YU: THE JAPANESE TEA CEREMONY A. L. SADLER, 1962
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
The Japanese tea ceremony called Cha-no-yu (“Hot Water for Tea”) has
origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement in the
sixteenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no Rikyu.
Although not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the
preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser on
aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu, the secret of success
consisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one’s work.
One day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance’s house for a tea
ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique-looking
gate at their host’s house gave it an evocatively lonely appearance. “I don’t
think so,” replied his father, “it looks as though it had been brought from
some mountain temple a long way off, and as if the labor required to import
it must have cost a lot of money.” If the owner of the house had put this
much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremony—and indeed
Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the
affectation and effort it inadvertently revealed.
On another evening, while having tea at a friend’s house, Rikyu saw his
host go outside, hold up a lantern in the darkness, cut a lemon off a tree, and
bring it in. This charmed Rikyu—the host needed a relish for the dish he
was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when the
man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that he
had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive
delicacy. The gesture no longer seemed spontaneous—it was a way for the
host to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he was
trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused
himself, and left.
Emperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea ceremony. On
the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly,
Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the stepping-stones
that led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw that
it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When
Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight—the
perfectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow—and noticed how
it called no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but
only to the polite gesture itself.
After Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the
practice of the tea ceremony. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the
great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu’s teachings. In his garden he
had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu
asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yorinobu replied that he would
be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for the
visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no-yu, thought
the stone lantern misshapen, its windows being too small for the present
taste. They had a local workman enlarge the windows. A few days before
Lord Sakai’s visit, Yorinobu toured the garden. When he saw the altered
windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his sword the fool who
had ruined the lantern, upsetting its natural grace and destroying the whole
purpose of Lord Sakai’s visit.
When Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he had
originally bought two of the lanterns, and that the second was in his garden
on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale boat and the
finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the lantern to him within
two days—a difficult feat at best. But the sailors rowed day and night, and
with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To Yorinobu’s
delight, this stone lantern was more magnificent than the first, for it had
stood untouched for twenty years in a bamboo thicket, acquiring a brilliant
antique appearance and a delicate covering of moss. When Lord Sakai
arrived, later that same day, he was awed by the lantern, which was more
magnificent than he had imagined—so graceful and at one with the
elements. Fortunately he had no idea what time and effort it had cost
Yorinobu to create this sublime effect.
THE WRESTLING MASTER
There was once a wrestling master who was versed in 360 feints and holds.
He took a special liking to one of his pupils, to whom he taught 359 of them
over a period of time. Somehow he never got around to the last trick. As
months went by the young man became so proficient in the art that he
bested everyone who dared to face him in the ring. He was so proud of his
prowess that one day he boasted before the sultan that he could readily
whip his master, were it not out of respect for his age and gratitude for his
tutelage.
The sultan became incensed at this irreverence and ordered an immediate
match with the royal court in attendance.
At the gong the youth barged forward with a lusty yell, only to be
confronted with the unfamiliar 360th feint. The master seized his former
pupil, lifted him high above his head, and flung him crashing to the ground.
The sultan and the assembly let out a loud cheer. When the sultan asked the
master how he was able to overcome such a strong opponent, the master
confessed that he had reserved a secret technique for himself for just such a
contingency. Then he related the lamentation of a master of archery, who
taught everything he knew. “No one has learned archery from me,” the
poor fellow complained, “who has not tried to use me as a butt in the end.”
 
A STORY OF SAADI, AS TOLD IN THE CRAFT OF POWER, R.G. H.
SIU, 1979
 
Interpretation
To Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost
accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without
warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws
and processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and
contrivance. And when they showed the effort of producing the effect, the
effect was spoiled. The gate came from too far away, the cutting of the
lemon looked contrived.
You will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your effects—the
cushions in the snow, the men rowing all night—but your audience must
never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone into them. Nature does
not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature by appearing effortless
approximates nature’s power.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
The great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his act as “The
Impossible Possible.” And indeed those who witnessed his dramatic escapes
felt that what he did onstage contradicted commonsense ideas of human
capacity.
One evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a theater to
watch Houdini accept a challenge: to escape from a pair of manacles billed
as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets of locks and nine
tumblers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years
constructing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen
anything so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them
impossible to escape.
The crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini’s wrists.
Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes went
by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that these manacles
would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the cabinet,
and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could take off
his coat—it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his request
was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and without using
his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders, turn it inside
out, remove a penknife from his vest pocket with his teeth, and, by moving
his head, cut the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he stepped back into
the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his grace and dexterity.
Finally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini emerged
from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the manacles
raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed the
escape. Although he had taken close to an hour to free himself, he had never
looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by the end
that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama, to make
the audience worry—for there was no other sign that the performance had
been anything but easy. The complaint about the heat was equally part of
the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini performances must have
felt he was toying with them: These manacles are nothing, he seemed to
say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a lot worse.
Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an
embalmed “sea monster” (a half octopus, half whalelike beast that had
beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope
from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through brick
walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while dangling high in the air; he
leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manacled and his legs in
chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full of water, hands pad-
locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself
free, struggling for close to an hour apparently without breathing. Each time
he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman aplomb.
Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no clues as to how he
accomplished any of his tricks—he left his audiences and critics
speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the
inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten-
thousand-pound elephant disappear before an audience’s eyes, a feat he
repeated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained
how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there
was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.
The effortlessness of Houdini’s escapes led some to think he used occult
forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his
body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to know
Houdini’s secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets. Kleppini also claimed
to have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland.
Houdini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around about his
methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902 he
challenged Kleppini to a handcuff duel. Kleppini accepted. Through a spy,
he found out the secret word to unlock a pair of French combination-lock
cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to choose these cuffs to escape
from onstage. This would definitively debunk Houdini—his “genius”
simply lay in his use of mechanical gadgets.
On the night of the challenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini
offered him a choice of cuffs and he selected the ones with the combination
lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a screen to make a
quick test, and reemerged seconds later, confident of victory.
Acting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to lock Kleppini in the
cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each
other onstage. After a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated
Houdini gave up and locked Kleppini in the cuffs. For the next few minutes
Kleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong—minutes earlier he had
opened the cuffs behind the screen; now the same code no longer worked.
He sweated, racking his brains. Hours went by, the audience left, and finally
an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be released.
The cuffs that Kleppini himself had opened behind the screen with the
word “C-L-E-F-S” (French for “keys”) now clicked open only with the
word “F-R-A-U-D.” Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had
accomplished this uncanny feat.
Keep the extent of your abilities unknown. The wise man does not allow his
knowledge and abilities to be sounded to the bottom, if he desires to be
honored by all. He allows you to know them but not to comprehend them.
No one must know the extent of his abilities, lest he be disappointed. No one
ever has an opportunity of fathoming him entirely. For guesses and doubts
about the extent of his talents arouse more veneration than accurate
knowledge of them, be they ever so great.
BALTASAR GRACIÁN. 1601-1658
Interpretation
Although we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished many of
his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the occult, or any
kind of magic, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless
practice, all of which he carefully concealed from the world. Houdini never
left anything to chance—day and night he studied the workings of locks,
researched centuries-old sleight-of-hand tricks, pored over books on
mechanics, whatever he could use. Every moment not spent researching he
spent working his body, keeping himself exceptionally limber, and learning
how to control his muscles and his breathing.
Early on in Houdini’s career, an old Japanese performer whom he toured
with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then bring it
back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied to a
string—up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat
muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The
organizers of the London handcuff challenge had searched Houdini’s body
thoroughly beforehand, but no one could check the inside of his throat,
where he could have concealed small tools to help him escape. Even so,
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini’s tools but his
practice, work, and research that made his escapes possible.
Kleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set the
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French cuffs, then
baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two men’s
tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to “F-R-A-U-D.”
He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw none of the
sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever nervous; he induced
nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the time it would take
to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and making the audience
squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and easy, made him look
like a superman.
As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before
appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and
labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their
diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker—as if
anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as if
they weren’t really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to
yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a god. One never sees
the source of a god’s power revealed; one only sees its effects.
A line [of poetry] will take us hours maybe; 
Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought, 
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.
Adam’s Curse, William Buller Yeats, 1865-1939
KEYS TO POWER
Humanity’s first notions of power came from primitive encounters with
nature—the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and
ferocity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning—
they awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their
power over life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have
always wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have re-
created the speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing:
Our machines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very
best creations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that
move easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will
comes from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence of a
creature less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to
such a state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we
elicit in others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in
humankind.
One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came from
that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In The Book of
the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the highly
elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet,
Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he
calls sprezzatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the
courtier to “practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all
artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and
effortless.” We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is
accomplished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold
—“whereas ... to labor at what one is doing and ... to make bones over it,
shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth,
to be discounted.”
Much of the idea of sprezzatura came from the world of art. All the great
Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the
finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade
even popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear of
imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the magic
of their effect, and their studied atmosphere of ease and natural beauty.
The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed the
work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective. The
effort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was too
obvious in his work—it made his paintings ugly and labored, overwhelmed
by the effort of their effects. We have the same response when we watch
performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them trying so
hard
