LAW 38
THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS
JUDGMENT
If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your
unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only
want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to
punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and
nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends
and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.
THINK WITH THE FEW AND SPEAK WITH THE MANY
It is easy to run into danger by trying to swim against the stream. Only a
Socrates could attempt to do that. Disagreement is regarded as offensive
because it is a condemnation of the views of others; the numbers of the
disgruntled grow, on account either of some matter that has been the object
of censure or of some person who has praised it: Truth is for the few, error
is as usual as it is vulgar. Nor is the wise man to be recognized by what he
says in the marketplace, for he speaks there not with his own voice, but with
that of universal folly, however much his inmost thoughts may gainsay it:
The wise man avoids being contradicted as sedulously as he avoids
contradicting; the publicity of censure is withheld from that which readily
provokes it. Thought is free; it cannot and should not be coerced; retire into
the sanctuary of your silence and if you sometimes allow yourself to break
it, do so under the aegis of a discreet few.
BALTASAR GRACIÁN, 1601-1658
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to Persia led
by the young Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city-states of Greece had
recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias,
along with allied ships from Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and
win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied. Both
the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pausanias-he had
proven himself as a fearless warrior, with a flair for the dramatic.
With amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took Cyprus, then moved
on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and captured
Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the Persian
empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond his
normal flamboyance. He appeared in public wearing pomades in his hair
and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyptians.
He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and
demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his old friends, entered into
communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected the
style and manner of a Persian dictator.
Clearly power and success had gone to Pausanias’s head. His army-
Athenians and Spartans alike-at first thought this a passing fancy: He had
always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he flaunted his
disdain for the Greeks’ simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek
soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no
concrete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other
side, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell the
possibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pausanias of his command and
called him home.
Pausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in
Sparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and returned to
the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the fight
against the Persians. Actually, however, he had different plans—to make
himself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes himself. The Spartans
declared him a public enemy and sent a ship to capture him. Pausanias
surrendered, certain that he could clear himself of the charges of treason. It
did come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had
offended his fellow Greeks time and again, erecting monuments, for
instance, in his own name, rather than in those of the cities whose troops
had fought alongside him, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right:
Despite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans
refused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let him go.
Now thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to take a
letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the Spartan
authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the messenger
arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they could hide and listen
behind a partition. What Pausanias said shocked them-they had never heard
such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one of their own—and
they made arrangements for his immediate arrest.
On his way home from the temple, Pausanias got word of what had
happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed
him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender.
Unwilling to forcibly remove him from the sacred temple, the authorities
kept him trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation.
Bene vixit, qui bene latuit—“He lives well who conceals himself well. ”
 
OVID, c. 43 B.C.-A.D. 18
 
Interpretation
At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another
culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the
asceticism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the Persian love
of luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with
a sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and simplicity.
This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were
not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People who
flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a disdain and
contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance of the
exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unquestioningly
follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of superiority.
Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect for those who
do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their difference so
dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose beliefs they
challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively nonetheless.
As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, “By his contempt for the laws and his
imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely suspected of
being unwilling to abide by normal standards.” Cultures have norms that
reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such
things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through
isolation—a position of real powerlessness.
Many of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign.
Measure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of
thinking and acting will reveal a different motive—to demonstrate your
superiority over your fellows.
Wise men [should be] like coffers with double bottoms: Which when others
look into, being opened, they see not all that they hold.
SIR WALTER RALEIGH, 1554-1618
WHEN THE WATERS WERE CHANGED
Once upon a time Khidr, the teacher of Moses, called upon mankind with a
warning. At a certain date, he said, all the water in the world which had not
been specially hoarded, would disappear. It would then be renewed, with
different water, which would drive men mad. Only one man listened to the
meaning of this advice. He collected water and went to a secure place
where he stored it, and waited for the water to change its character. On the
appointed date the streams stopped running, the wells went dry, and the
man who had listened, seeing this happening, went to his retreat and drank
his preserved water. When he saw, from his security, the waterfalls again
beginning to flow, this man descended among the other sons of men. He
found that they were thinking and talking in an entirely different way from
before; yet they had no memory of what had happened, nor of having been
warned. When he tried to talk to them, he realized that they thought that he
was mad, and they showed hostility or compassion, not understanding. At
first he drank none of the new water, but went back to his concealment, to
draw on his supplies, every day. Finally, however, he took the decision to
drink the new water because he could not bear the loneliness of living,
behaving and thinking in a different way from everyone else. He drank the
new water, and became like the rest. Then he forgot all about his own store
of special water, and his fellows began to look upon him as a madman who
had miraculously been restored to sanity.
TALES OF THE DERVISHES, IDRIES SHAH, 1967
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
During the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the Protestant
Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as it was called,
included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations from
the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the scientist Galileo, but an
important thinker who suffered even greater persecution was the Dominican
monk and philosopher Tommaso Campanella.
A follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher
Epicurus, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell.
The Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control the
common folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on atheism, and
Campanella expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the Inquisition threw him
into prison for his heretical beliefs. Six years later, as a form of partial
release, he was confined to a monastery in Naples.
Southern Italy was controlled by Spain at the time, and in Naples
Campanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these invaders.
His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his own ideas
of utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with their Spanish
counterparts, had him imprisoned again. This time they also tortured him, to
discover the true nature of his impious beliefs: He was subjected to the
infamous la veglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his arms in a
squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes. The
posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up
sitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact.
During these years, however, Campanella learned something about
power. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his strategy:
He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise their
outward appearance.
To save his life, Campanella feigned madness. He let his inquisitors
imagine that his beliefs stemmed from an incontrollable unsoundness of
mind. For a while the tortures continued, to see if his insanity was faked,
but in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four years
of this he spent chained to a wall in an underground dungeon. Despite such
conditions, he continued to write—although no longer would he be so
foolish as to express his ideas directly.
One book of Campanella’s, The Hispanic Monarchy, promoted the idea
that Spain had a divine mission to expand its powers around the world, and
offered the Spanish king practical, Machiavelli-type advice for achieving
this. Despite his own interest in Machiavelli, the book in general presented
ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanic Monarchy was in
fact a ploy, an attempt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the boldest
manner possible. It worked: In 1626, six years after its publication, the pope
finally let Campanella out of prison.
Shortly after gaining his freedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Conquered,
a book attacking free-thinkers, Machiavellians, Calvinists, and heretics of
all stripes. The book is written in the form of debates in which heretics
express their beliefs and are countered by arguments for the superiority of
Catholicism. Campanella had obviously reformed—his book made that
clear. Or did it?
The arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been
expressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side
only to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against
Catholicism with striking passion. When he argued the other side,
supposedly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale clichés and
convoluted rationales. Brief and eloquent, the heretics’ arguments seemed
bold and sincere. The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome
and unconvincing.
Catholics who read the book found it disturbing and ambiguous, but they
could not claim it was heretical, or that Campanella should be returned to
prison. His defense of Catholicism, after all, used arguments they had used
themselves. Yet in the years to come, Atheism Conquered became a bible
for atheists, Machiavellians and libertines who used the arguments
Campanella had put in their mouths to defend their dangerous ideas.
Combining an outward display of conformity with an expression of his true
beliefs in a way that his sympathizers would understand, Campanella
showed that he had learned his lesson.
Interpretation
In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strategic
moves that saved his hide, freed him from prison, and allowed him to
continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned madness—the medieval
equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one’s actions, like blaming one’s
parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact opposite of his
own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his ideas while
insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful trick: You
pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of your
disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You seem to
conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will understand
the irony involved. You are protected.
It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact
with their original motives and become oppressive. And there will always
be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of
their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point
in making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you suffering
and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose—better to live on in an
oppressive world, even to thrive in it. Meanwhile find a way to express your
ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before swine
will only bring you trouble.
Never combat any man's opinion; for though you reached the age of
Methuselah, you would never have done setting him right upon all the
absurd things that he believes.
It is also well to avoid correcting people’s mistakes in conversation,
however good your intentions may be; for it is easy to offend people, and
difficult, if not impossible to mend them.
If you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose conversation
you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are listening to the
dialogue of two fools in a comedy. Probatum est.
The man who comes into the world with the notion that he is really going to
instruct it in matters of the highest importance, may thank his stars if he
escapes with a whole skin.
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
For a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever believe 
what I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth, 
I hide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.
Niccolò Machiavelli, in a letter to Francesco Gnicciardini, May 17, 1521
KEYS TO POWER
We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a
social impossibility. From an early age we learn to conceal our thoughts,
telling the prickly and insecure what we know they want to hear, watching
carefully lest we offend them. For most of us this is natural—there are ideas
and values that most people accept, and it is pointless to argue. We believe
what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask.
There are people, however, who see such restraints as an intolerable
infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the
superiority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their arguments
convince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do
not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking
about them. There is a strong emotional content in their beliefs: They really
do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you
challenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirectly
through your behavior, they are hostile.
Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional
behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them.
The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left alone to
have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the people they
want to express them to, without suffering isolation or ostracism. Once they
have established themselves in a position of power, they can try to convince
a wider circle of the correctness of their ideas—perhaps working indirectly,
using Campanella’s strategies of irony and insinuation.
In the late fourteenth century, the Spanish began a massive persecution of
the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the country. Those
who remained in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next three
hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed them:
Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet somehow
managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in private.
Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term, being the
Spanish for “pig”) attained high levels of government office, married into
the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only to be
discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition was
specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they mastered
the art of dissimulation, displaying crucifixes liberally, giving generous
gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-Semitic remarks—and all
the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs.
In society, the Marranos knew, outward appearances are what matter.
This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in
writing Atheism Conquered, make a show of blending in, even going so far
as to be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick
to conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differently
in private.
THE CITIZEN AND THE TRAVELLER
“Look around you,” said the citizen. “This is the largest market in the
world.” “Oh surely not,” said the traveller. “Well, perhaps not the largest,”
said the citizen, “but much the best.” “You are certainly wrong there,” said
the traveller. “I can tell you....” They buried the stranger in the dusk.
FABLES, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, 1850-1894
If Machiavelli had had a prince for disciple, the first thing he would have
recommended him to do would have been to write a book against
Machiavellism.
VOLTAIRE, 1694-1778
Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old
orthodoxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten
past politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he
broke all the rules—going public with a discovery before showing it to the
scientific community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging
the scientists who had paved the way, making himself a star. The public
may have loved him but scientists shunned him. His disrespect for his
community’s orthodoxies left him isolated, and he wasted years trying to
heal the breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation.
