LAW 31
CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH
THE CARDS YOU DEAL
JUDGMENT
The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a
choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets.
Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose.
Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which
serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored
wherever they turn.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I
From early in his reign, Ivan IV, later known as Ivan the Terrible, had to
confront an unpleasant reality: The country desperately needed reform, but
he lacked the power to push it through. The greatest limit to his authority
came from the boyars, the Russian princely class that dominated the country
and terrorized the peasantry.
In 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed, nearing
death, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the new czar.
Some hesitated, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw he had no
power over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he never forgot
the lesson: The boyars were out to destroy him. And indeed in the years to
come, many of the most powerful of them defected to Russia’s main
enemies, Poland and Lithuania, where they plotted their return and the
overthrow of the czar. Even one of Ivan’s closest friends, Prince Andrey
Kurbski, suddenly turned against him, defecting to Lithuania in 1564, and
becoming the strongest of Ivan’s enemies.
When Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal dynasty
seemed suddenly more precarious than ever. With émigré nobles fomenting
invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from the east, and the boyars
stirring up trouble within the country, Russia’s vast size made it a nightmare
to defend. In whatever direction Ivan struck, he would leave himself
vulnerable on the other side. Only if he had absolute power could he deal
with this many-headed Hydra. And he had no such power.
Ivan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the citizens
of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled the square
before the Kremlin, loaded with the czar’s treasures and with provisions for
the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the czar and his court boarded
the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he established himself in a
village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of terror gripped the
capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had abandoned them to the
bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs gathered daily.
Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a letter arrived from the czar, explaining that
he could no longer bear the boyars’ betrayals and had decided to abdicate
once and for all.
The German Chancellor Bismarck, enraged at the constant criticisms from
Rudolf Virchow (the German pathologist and liberal politician), had his
seconds call upon the scientist to challenge him to a duel. “As the
challenged party, I have the choice of weapons,” said Virchow, “and I
choose these.” He held aloft two large and apparently identical sausages.
“One of these,” he went on, “is infected with deadly germs; the orher is
perfectly sound. Let His Excellency decide which one he wishes to eat, and I
will eat the other.” Almost immediately the message came back that the
chancellor had decided to cancel the duel.

Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and
commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan’s decision, and took to the streets,
terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates
representing the church, the princes, and the people made the journey to
Ivan’s village, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia,
to return to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After
days of hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either
they grant him absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no
interference from the boyars, or they find a new leader.
Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotic
power, almost every sector of Russian society “opted” for a strong czar,
calling for Ivan’s return to Moscow and the restoration of law and order. In
February, with much celebration, Ivan returned to Moscow. The Russians
could no longer complain if he behaved dictatorially—they had given him
this power themselves.
Interpretation
 
 
Ivan the Terrible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to the boyars would
lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a different kind of
ruin. Even if Ivan came out of such a war on top, the country would be
devastated and its divisions would be stronger than ever. His weapon of
choice in the past had been to make a bold, offensive move. Now, however,
that kind of move would turn against him—the more boldly he confronted
his enemies, the worse the reactions he would spark.
The main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up resentment and
eventually leads to a response that eats at your authority. Ivan, immensely
creative in the use of power, saw clearly that the only path to the kind of
victory he wanted was a false withdrawal. He would not force the country
over to his position, he would give it “options”: either his abdication, and
certain anarchy, or his accession to absolute power. To back up his move, he
made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: “Call my bluff,” he said, “and
watch what happens.” No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just a
month, he showed the country a glimpse of the nightmares that would
follow his abdication—Tartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did
eventually come to pass after Ivan’s death, in the infamous “Time of the
Troubles.”)
Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the
options. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without you,
and you offer them a “choice”: I stay away and you suffer the
consequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate. In this method
of controlling people’s options, they choose the option that gives you power
because the alternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but
indirectly: They seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a
choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.
THE LIAR
Once upon a time there was a king of Armenia, who, being of a curious turn
of mind and in need of some new diversion, sent his heralds throughout the
land to make the following proclamation: “Hear this! Whatever man among
you can prove himself the most outrageous liar in Armenia shall receive an
apple made of pure gold from the hands of His Majesty the King!” People
began to swarm to the palace from every town and hamlet in the country,
people of all ranks and conditions, princes, merchants, farmers, priests,
rich and poor, tall and short, fat and thin. There was no lack of liars in the
land, and each one told his tale to the king. A ruler, however, has heard
practically every sort of lie, and none of those now told him convinced the
king that he had listened to the best of them. The king was beginning to
grow tired of his new sport and was thinking of calling the whole contest off
without declaring a winner, when there appeared before him a poor, ragged
man, carrying a large earthenware pitcher under his arm. “What can I do
for you?” asked His Majesty. “Sire!” said the poor man, slightly
bewildered. “Surely you remember? You owe me a pot of gold, and I have
come to collect it.” “You are a perfect liar, sir!’ exclaimed the king “I owe
you no money” “A perfect liar, am I?” said the poor man. “Then give me
the golden apple!” The king, realizing that the man was trying to trick him,
started to hedge. ”No. no! You are not a liar!” ”Then give me the pot of
gold you owe me, sire.” said the man. The king saw the dilemma, He
handed over the golden apple.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
As a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that
her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristocracy,
and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect, satisfied
her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an equal.
Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however, Ninon’s
mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, totally alone
in the world—no family, no dowry, nothing to fall back upon. A kind of
panic overtook her and she entered a convent, turning her back on her
illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons.
When she finally reappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to
her door in greater numbers than ever before, for she was the wittiest and
most spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been greatly
missed.
Ninon’s followers quickly discovered, however, that she had changed her
old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of options. The dukes,
seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her services could continue to
do so, but they were no longer in control—she would sleep with them when
she wanted, according to her whim. All their money bought them was a
possibility. If it was her pleasure to sleep with them only once a month, so
be it.
Those who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join the
large and growing group of men she called her martyrs—men who visited
her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her lute-playing,
and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period, including
Molière, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint-Évremond. The martyrs, too,
however, entertained a possibility: She would regularly select from them a
favori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay, and to
whom she would abandon herself completely for as long as she so desired
—a week, a few months, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a favori,
but a martyr had no guarantee of becoming one, and indeed could remain
disappointed for an entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for example, never
enjoyed Ninon’s favors, but never stopped coming to visit—he did not want
to do without her company.
As word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon became the
object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan
scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, however,
it did not discourage her male suitors—indeed it only increased their
numbers and intensified their desire. It became an honor to be a payeur,
helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon,
accompanying her sometimes to the theater, and sleeping with her when she
chose. Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company
without paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some
day becoming her favori. That possibility spurred on many a young
nobleman, as word spread that none among the courtesans could surpass
Ninon in the art of love. And so the married and the single, the old and the
young, entered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them,
both of which amply satisfied her.
Interpretation
The life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that was denied
a married woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man who paid for the
courtesan’s services in essence owned her, determining when he could
possess her and when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older,
her options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty
she had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courtesan’s
legendary greed, then, reflected a practical necessity, yet also lessened her
allure, since the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often
alienated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the courtesan
aged, then, she faced a most difficult fate.
Ninon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early on
tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a
system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system
she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her.
The payeurs may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep
with them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every
other courtesan: She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs’
avoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as
members of Ninon’s fraternity of admirers, they also might some day
experience the ultimate pleasure of being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not
force her suitors into either category. They could “choose” which side they
preferred—a freedom that left them a vestige of masculine pride.
Such is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of one,
for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alternatives
set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain risk—one option would have
led to his losing his power—Ninon created a situation in which every option
redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the money she
needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs she gained the ultimate in
power: She could surround herself with a bevy of admirers, a harem from
which to choose her lovers.
The system, though, depended on one critical factor: the possibility,
however remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The illusion that
riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into your victim’s lap
is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of choices. That hope, however
slim, will make men accept the most ridiculous situations, because it leaves
them the all-important option of a dream. The illusion of choice, married to
the possibility of future good fortune, will lure the most stubborn sucker
into your glittering web.
J. P. Morgan Sr. once told a jeweler of his acquaintance that he was
interested in buying a pearl scarf-pin. Just a few weeks later, the jeweler
happened upon a magnificent pearl. He had it mounted in an appropriate
setting and sent it to Morgan, together with a bill for $5,000. The following
day the package was returned. Morgan’s accompanying note read: “I like
the pin, but I don’t like the price. If you will accept the enclosed check for
$4,000, please send back the box with the seal unbroken.” The enraged
jeweler refused the check and dismissed the messenger in disgust. He
opened up the box to reclaim the unwanted pin, only to find that it had been
removed. In its place was a check for $5,000.

KEYS TO POWER
Words like “freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke a power of possibility
far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely,
the choices we have—in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs—tend to
have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply
between A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the picture. Yet as
long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the
missing options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we
have our freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our
liberty to choose.
This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from the
fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase “unlimited
options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would actually
paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of choices
comforts us.
This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for
deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard to
believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that you are
allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much more
powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of choices,
then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a saying: If you
can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that much more
prettily.
The following are among the most common forms of “controlling the
options”:
 
Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As
President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could
make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger
would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would
present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the best
solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the bait,
never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him. This is
an excellent device to use on the insecure master.
 
Force the Resister. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H.
Erickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His
patients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent
susceptibility to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon
relapse into old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. To
avoid this, Erickson began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to
make themselves feel as bad as when they first came in—to go back to
square one. Faced with this option, the patients would usually “choose” to
avoid the relapse—which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people who
enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to “choose”
what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
 
Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to create
an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they would
figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began secretly
buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he then
attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, he
reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or
simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller altered the
playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had were the
ones he gave them.
In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it
doesn’t matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all
costs.
 
The Shrinking Options. The late-nineteenth-century art dealer Ambroise
Vollard perfected this technique.
Customers would come to Vollard’s shop to see some Cézannes. He
would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to doze
off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would usually
come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time Vollard
would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they were the
same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offerings, leave to
think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same thing would
happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Finally the
buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing them,
because tomorrow they would have to settle for something worse, perhaps
at even higher prices.
A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer
hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to
use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are
getting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.
 
The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver by
controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-century
provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orléans, who
was notoriously ind
