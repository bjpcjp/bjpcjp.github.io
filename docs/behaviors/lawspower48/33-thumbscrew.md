LAW 33
DISCOVER EACH MAN’S THUMBSCREW
JUDGMENT
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually
an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small
secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to
your advantage.
FINDING THE THUMBSCREW: A Strategic Plan of Action
We all have resistances. We live with a perpetual armor around ourselves to
defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals. We
would like nothing more than to be left to do things our own way.
Constantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of energy.
One of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that
they all have a weakness, some part of their psychological armor that will
not resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some
people wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who
disguise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one
chink in their armor.
THE LION, THE CHAMOIS, AND THE FOX
A lion was chasing a chamois along a valley. He had all but caught it, and
with longing eyes was anticipating a certain and a satisfying repast. It
seemed as if it were utterly impossible for the victim to escape; for a deep
ravine appeared to bar the way for both the hunter and the hunted. But the
nimble chamois, gathering together all its strength, shot like an arrow from
a bow across the chasm, and stood still on the rocky cliff on the other side.
Our lion pulled up short. But at that moment a friend of his happened to be
near at hand. That friend was the fox. “What!” said he, “with your strength
and agility, is it possible that you will yield to a feeble chamois? You have
only to will, and you will be able to work wonders. Though the abyss be
deep, yet, if you are only in earnest, I am certain you will clear it. Surely
you can confide in my disinterested friendship. I would not expose your life
to danger if I were not so well aware of your strength and dexterity.” The
lion’s blood waxed hot, and began to boil in his veins. He flung himself with
all his might into space. But he could not clear the chasm; so down he
tumbled headlong, and was killed by the fall. Then what did his dear friend
do? He cautiously made his way down to the bottom of the ravine. and
there, out in the open space and the free air, seeing that the lion wanted
neither flattery nor obedience now, he set to work to pay the last sad rites to
his dead friend, and in a month picked his bones clean.
 
FABLES, IVAN KRILOFF, 1768-1844
 
In planning your assault, keep these principles in mind:
 
Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund Freud
remarked, “No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chatters
with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.” This is a
critical concept in the search for a person’s weakness—it is revealed by
seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.
The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look.
Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses, so train
yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested—the appearance of a
sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the
nineteenth-century French statesman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to
the other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made up,
or it can be real but of no great importance to you—the important thing is
that it should seem to come from the heart. This will usually elicit a
response that is not only as frank as yours but more genuine—a response
that reveals a weakness.
If you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it
indirectly. If, for instance, you sense that a man has a need to be loved,
openly flatter him. If he laps up your compliments, no matter how obvious,
you are on the right track. Train your eye for details—how someone tips a
waiter, what delights a person, the hidden messages in clothes. Find
people’s idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get—perhaps
you can be the supplier of their fantasies. Remember: Since we all try to
hide our weaknesses, there is little to be learned from our conscious
behavior. What oozes out in the little things outside our conscious control is
what you want to know.
 
Find the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood, before the
self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was pampered or
indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went
unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may
be buried but never disappears. Knowing about a childhood need gives you
a powerful key to a person’s weakness.
One sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person will
often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should
have been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without something
important, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or
its facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgence, indulge it. In
either case they will be unable to resist you.
 
Look for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People who
thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide a
lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for adventure; the shy are
dying for attention. By probing beyond appearances, you will often find
people’s weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you.
 
Find the Weak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not
what but who that matters. In today’s versions of the court, there is often
someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous
influence over the person superficially on top. These behind-the-scenes
powerbrokers are the group’s weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly
influence the king. Alternatively, even in a group of people acting with the
appearance of one will—as when a group under attack closes ranks to resist
an outsider—there is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person
who will bend under pressure.
 
Fill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and
unhappiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as
for the chronically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. The
insecure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their
weaknesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of
power, and an indefinitely prolongable one.
 
Feed on Uncontrollable Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion can be a
paranoid fear—a fear disproportionate to the situation—or any base motive
such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these emotions
often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for them.
IRVING LAZAR
[Hollywood super-agent] Irving Paul Lazar was once anxious to sell
[studio mogul] Jack L. Warner a play. “I had a long meeting with him
today,” Lazar explained [to screenwriter Garson Kanin], “but I didn’t
mention it, I didn’t even bring it up.” “Why not?” I asked. “Because I’m
going to wait until the weekend after next, when I go to Palm Springs.” “I
don’t understand.” “You don’t? I go to Palm Springs every weekend, but
Warner isn’t going this weekend. He’s got a preview or something. So he’s
not coming down till the next weekend, so that’s when I’m going to bring it
up. ” “Irving, I’m more and more confused.” “Look,” said Irving
impatiently, ”I know what I’m doing. I know how to sell Warner. This is a
type of material that he’s uneasy with, so I have to hit him with it hard and
suddenly to get an okay.” ”But why Palm Springs?” ”Because in Palm
Springs, every day he goes to the baths at The Spa. And that’s where I’m
going to be when he’s there. Now there’s a thing about Jack: He’s eighty
and he’s very vain, and he doesn’t like people to see him naked. So when I
walk up to him naked at The Spa—I mean he’s naked—well, I’m naked too,
but I don’t care who sees me. He does. And I walk up to him naked, and I
start to talk to him about this thing, he’ll be very embarrassed.And he’ll
want to get away from me, and the easiest way is to say ‘Yes,’ because he
knows if he says ‘No,’ then I’m going to stick with him, and stay right on it,
and not give up. So to get rid of me, he’ll probably say, ‘Yes.’” Two weeks
later, I read of the acquisition of this particular property by Warner
Brothers. I phoned Lazar and asked how it had been accomplished. ”How
do you think?” he asked. ”In the buff, that’s how... just the way I told you it
was going to work.”
HOLLYWOOD, GARSON KANIN, 1974
OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW
Observance I
In 1615 the thirty-year-old bishop of Luçon, later known as Cardinal
Richelieu, gave a speech before representatives of the three estates of
France—clergy, nobility, and commoners. Richelieu had been chosen to
serve as the mouthpiece for the clergy—an immense responsibility for a
man still young and not particularly well known. On all of the important
issues of the day, the speech followed the Church line. But near the end of it
Richelieu did something that had nothing to do with the Church and
everything to do with his career. He turned to the throne of the fifteen-year-
old King Louis XIII, and to the Queen Mother Marie de’ Médicis, who sat
beside Louis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his majority.
Everyone expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to the young king.
Instead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mother. Indeed
his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it
actually offended some in the Church. But the smile on the queen’s face as
she lapped up Richelieu’s compliments was unforgettable.
A year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state for
foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now
entered the inner circle of power, and he studied the workings of the court
as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino Concini, was the
queen mother’s favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made him perhaps
the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and
Richelieu played him perfectly—attending to him as if he were the king.
Within months Richelieu had become one of Concini’s favorites. But
something happened in 1617 that turned everything upside down: the young
king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had Concini
murdered and his most important associates imprisoned. In so doing Louis
took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the queen mother
aside.
Had Richelieu played it wrong? He had been close to both Concini and
Marie de Médicis, whose advisers and ministers were now all out of favor,
some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the Louvre, a
virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone was deserting Marie
de Médicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not get rid of her,
for the king was still very young, and had in any case always been
inordinately attached to her. As Marie’s only remaining powerful friend,
Richelieu filled the valuable function of liaison between the king and his
mother. In return he received her protection, and was able to survive the
palace coup, even to thrive. Over the next few years the queen mother grew
still more dependent on him, and in 1622 she repaid him for his loyalty:
Through the intercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was elevated to
the powerful rank of cardinal.
By 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to
advise him, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he
remained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to him. Now that
he had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretically
had no power, but she still had her son’s ear, and she kept telling him that
Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis would have none of it
—he hated the cardinal with a passion, only tolerating him out of love for
Marie. In the end, however, isolated in the court and crippled by his own
indecisiveness, he yielded to his mother and made Richelieu first his chief
councilor and later prime minister.
Now Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Médicis. He stopped visiting
and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even argued with her
and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on the king, making
himself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers,
understanding the king’s childishness, had tried to keep him out of trouble;
the shrewd Richelieu played him differently, deliberately pushing him into
one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the Huguenots
and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of these projects
only made the king more dependent on his powerful premier, the only man
able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next eighteen years,
Richelieu, exploiting the king’s weaknesses, governed and molded France
according to his own vision, unifying the country and making it a strong
European power for centuries to come.
Interpretation
Richelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategic move
was more important to him than discovering his enemy’s weaknesses and
applying pressure to them. As early as his speech in 1615, he was looking
for the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen
mother. Not that Marie was obviously weak—she governed both France and
her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who
needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with affection and
respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would
come when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis
loved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her.
The way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could
change overnight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his
affection would never change.
Once Richelieu had the position he desired—prime minister—he
discarded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain:
the king’s own character. There was a part of him that would always be a
helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the foundation of the
king’s weakness that Richelieu established his own power and fame.
Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person in
control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes—the
favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may have
more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends on all
kinds of capricious factors outside his control.
Finally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make decisions,
play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures. They will have to
depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure whom they
rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.
THE LITTLE THINGS COUNT
As time went on I came to look for the little weaknesses.... It’s the little
things that count. On one occasion, I worked on the president of a large
bank in Omaha. The [phony] deal involved the purchase of the street
railway system of Omaha, including a bridge across the Mississippi River.
My principals were supposedly German and I had to negotiate with Berlin.
While awaiting word from them I introduced my fake mining-stock
proposition. Since this man was rich, I decided to play for high stakes....
Meanwhile, I played golf with the banker, visited his home, and went to the
theater with him and his wife. Though he showed some interest in my stock
deal, he still wasn’t convinced. I had built it up to the point that an
investment of $1,250,000 was required. Of this I was to put up $900,000,
the banker $350,000. But still he hesitated. One evening when I was at his
home for dinner I wore some perfume-Coty’s “April Violets.” It was not
then considered effeminate for a man to use a dash of perfume. The
banker’s wife thought it very lovely. “Where did you get it?” “It is a rare
blend,” I told her, “especially made for me by a French perfumer. Do you
like it?” ”I love it,” she replied. The following day I went through my
effects and found two empty bottles. Both had come from France, but were
empty. I went to a downtown department store and purchased ten ounces of
Coty’s “April Violets.” I poured this into the two French bottles, carefully
sealed them, wrapped them in tissue paper. That evening I dropped by the
banker’s home and presented the two bottles to his wife. ”They were
especially put up for me in Cologne,” I told her. The next day the banker
called at my hotel. His wife was enraptured by the perfume. She considered
it the most wonderful, the most exotic fragrance she had ever used. I did not
tell the banker he could get all he wanted right in Omaha. ”She said,” the
banker added, ”that I was fortunate to be associated with a man like you.”
From then on his attitude was changed, for he had complete faith in his
wife’s judgment .... He parted with $350,000. This, incidentally was my
biggest [con] score.
“YELLOW KID” WEIL, 1875-1976
Observance II
In December of 1925, guests at the swankiest hotel in Palm Beach, Florida,
watched with interest as a mysterious man arrived in a Rolls-Royce driven
by a Japanese chauffeur. Over the next few days they studied this handsome
man, who walked with an elegant cane, received telegrams at all hours, and
only engaged in the briefest of conversations. He was a count, they heard,
Count Victor Lustig, and he came from one of the wealthiest families in
Europe—but this was all they could find out.
Imagine their amazement, then, when Lustig one day walked up to one of
the least distinguished guests in the hotel, a Mr. Herman Loller, head of an
engineering company, and entered into conversation with him. Loller had
made his fortune only recently, and forging social connections was very
important to him. He felt honored and somewhat intimidated by this
sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with a hint of a foreign
accent. Over the days to come, the two became friends.
Loller of course did most of the talking, and one night he confessed that
his business was doing poorly, with more troubles ahead. In return, Lustig
confided in his new friend that he too had serious money problems—
Communists had seized his family estate and all its assets. He was too old
to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily he had found an answer—“ a
money-making machine.” “You counterfeit?” Loller whispered in half-
shock. No, Lustig replied, explaining that through a secret chemical
process, his machine could duplicate any paper currency with complete
accuracy. Put in a dollar bill and six hours later you had two, both perfect.
He proceeded to explain how the machine had been smuggled out of
Europe, how the Germans had developed it to undermine the British, how it
had supported the count for several years, and on and on. When Loller
insisted on a demonstration, the two men went to Lustig’s room, where the
count produced a magnificent mahogany box fitted with slots, cranks, and
dials. Loller watched as Lustig inserted a dollar bill in the box. Sure
enough, early the following morning Lustig pulled out two bills, still wet
from the chemicals.
Lustig gave the notes to Loller, who immediately took the bills to a local
bank—which accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman feverishly
begged Lustig to sell him a machine. The count explained that there was
only one in existence, so Loller made him a high offer: $25,000, then a
considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today’s terms). Even so,
Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay
so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, “I suppose it
matters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recov
