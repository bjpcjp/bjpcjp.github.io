LAW 14
POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY
JUDGMENT
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable
information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy
yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions
to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no
occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time—from
1904 to 1940 he almost single-handedly monopolized America’s millionaire
art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded him: the industrialist
Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon a
client.
Duveen’s friends said this was an impossible dream. Mellon was a stiff,
taciturn man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative
Duveen rubbed him the wrong way—he had made it clear he had no desire
to meet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends, “Not only will
Mellon buy from me but he will buy only from me.” For several years he
tracked his prey, learning the man’s habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he
secretly put several of Mellon’s staff on his own payroll, worming valuable
information out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon
about as well as Mellon’s wife did.
In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on the
third floor of Claridge’s Hotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite just
below Mellon’s, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
befriend Mellon’s valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that he had just
helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was making
his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.
Duveen’s valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Seconds
later, Duveen entered the lift, and lo and behold, there was Mellon. “How
do you do, Mr. Mellon?” said Duveen, introducing himself. “I am on my
way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.” How uncanny—that
was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to
accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He
knew Mellon’s taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered
through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once
again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes.
Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had
expected. The man was charming and agreeable, and clearly had exquisite
taste. When they returned to New York, Mellon visited Duveen’s exclusive
gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough,
seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest of
his life he was Duveen’s best and most generous client.
Interpretation
A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to
chance. What’s the point of winging it, of just hoping you may be able to
charm this or that client? It’s like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself
with a little knowledge and your aim improves.
Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen’s catches, but he spied on
many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients’ household
staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable
information about their masters’ comings and goings, changes in taste, and
other such tidbits of information that would put him a step ahead. A rival of
Duveen’s who wanted to make Henry Frick a client noticed that whenever
he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before him, as if he
had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere, and to
know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and disheartened
them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy clients who could
make a dealer rich.
Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-powerful,
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem
charming, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of
your power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.
Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through 
scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes.
Kautilya, Indian philosopher third century B. C.
KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events.
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won’t tell you all their
thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep
the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior
motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and
are constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find
out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what you
are up to.
This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you
secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others consult
the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete means of seeing
into the future.
The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen did.
The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather
information, but you have little control over the people who are doing the
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while
secretly gathering information.
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners of
this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in polite
conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit and
grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words that
imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he inject
his own personality.” The key here is Talleyrand’s ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.
Throughout Talleyrand’s life, people said he was a superb
conversationalist—yet he actually said very little. He never talked about his
own ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games
of charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he
would carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and
gather information invaluable to his work as France’s foreign minister. At
the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He
would blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had
made up), then watch his listeners’ reactions. He might tell a gathering of
diplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the
czar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general for treason. By
watching the diplomats’ reactions to this made-up story, he would know
which ones were most excited by the weakening of the Russian army—
perhaps their governments had designs on Russia? As Baron von Stetten
said, “Monsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump
out the window.”
If you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you a lie, look as
though you believed every word he said. This will give him courage to go
on; he will become more vehement in his assertions, and in the end betray
himself. Again, if you perceive that a person is trying to conceal something
from you, but with only partial success, look as though you did not believe
him. The opposition on your part will provoke him into leading out his
reserve of truth and bringing the whole force of it to bear upon your
incredulity.
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention. This is
when people’s guards are down. By suppressing your own personality, you
can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is that they
will mistake your interest in them for friendship, so that you not only learn,
you make allies.
Nevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If
people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the
cover of conversation, they will strictly avoid you. Emphasize friendly
chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information
cannot be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about
yourself and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.
A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote,
“Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses—
one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.”
By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you
make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a false
confession and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified
by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemently
contradicting people you’re in conversation with as a way of irritating them,
stirring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In
their emotional reaction they will reveal all kinds of truths about
themselves, truths you can later use against them.
Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay little traps that
make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II, a notoriously clever
seventh-century king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing through his
subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance, that two of his
courtiers had become particularly friendly, he would call one of them aside
and say he had information that the other was a traitor, and would soon be
killed. The king would tell the courtier he trusted him more than anyone,
and that he must keep this information secret. Then he would watch the two
men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had not changed in his
behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the first courtier had kept
the secret, and he would quickly promote the man, later taking him aside to
confess, “I meant to kill your friend because of certain information that had
reached me, but, when I investigated the matter, I found it was untrue.” If,
on the other hand, the second courtier started to avoid the king, acting aloof
and tense, Chosroes would know that the secret had been revealed. He
would ban the second courtier from his court, letting him know that the
whole business had only been a test, but that even though the man had done
nothing wrong, he could no longer trust him. The first courtier, however,
had revealed a secret, and him Chosroes would ban from his entire
kingdom.
It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical information
but a person’s character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving
problems before they arise.
By tempting people into certain acts, you learn about their loyalty, their
honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most valuable
of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

Authority: Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise general conquer
the enemy whenever they move, and their achievements surpass those of
ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of the enemy situation. This
“foreknowledge” cannot be elicited from spirits, nor from gods, nor by
analogy with past events, nor by astrologic calculations. It must be obtained
from men who know the enemy situation—from spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art of
War, fourth century B.C.)
REVERSAL
Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you
must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons
in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As
Winston Churchill said, “Truth is so precious that she should always be
attended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround yourself with such a
bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the
information of your choice, you control the game.
In 1944 the Nazis’ rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated.
Over two thousand V-1 flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five
thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the
Germans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for
Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the
less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the
Germans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not
know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, English-
controlled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information.
The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time
they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent
advantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one
of your enemy’s eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.
