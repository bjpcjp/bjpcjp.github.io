LAW 6
COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST
JUDGMENT
Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing.
Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand
out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by
appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid
masses.
PART I: SURROUND YOUR NAME WITH THE
SENSATIONAL AND SCANDALOUS
Draw attention to yourself by creating an unforgettable, even controversial
image. Court scandal. Do anything to make yourself seem larger than life
and shine more brightly than those around you. Make no distinction
between kinds of attention—notoriety of any sort will bring you power.
Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
P.T. Barnum, America’s premier nineteenth-century showman, started his
career as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the
circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for a series of performances. On the
morning of opening day, Barnum took a stroll through town, wearing a new
black suit. People started to follow him. Someone in the gathering crowd
shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infamous as a man
acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most
Americans. The angry mob tore off Barnum’s suit and was ready to lynch
him. After desperate appeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow him
to the circus, where he could verify his identity.
THE WASP AND THE PRINCE
A wasp named Pin Tail was long in quest of some deed that would make him
forever famous. So one day he entered the king’s palace and stung the little
prince, who was in bed. The prince awoke with loud cries. The king and his
courtiers rushed in to see what had happened. The prince was yelling as the
wasp stung him again and again. The courtiers tried to catch the wasp, and
each in turn was stung. The whole royal household rushed in, the news soon
spread, and people flocked to the palace. The city was in an uproar, all
business suspended. Said the wasp to itself, before it expired from its efforts,
“A name without fame is like fire without flame. There is nothing like
attracting notice at any cost.”
INDIAN FABLE
Once there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke—he
himself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The crowd dispersed,
but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not amused. He wanted to
know what could have induced his boss to play such a trick. “My dear Mr.
Barnum,” Turner replied, “it was all for our good. Remember, all we need
to ensure success is notoriety.” And indeed everyone in town was talking
about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night it
stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget.
Barnum’s first big venture of his own was the American Museum—a
collection of curiosities, located in New York. One day a beggar approached
Barnum in the street. Instead of giving him money, Barnum decided to
employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he gave the man five bricks
and told him to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain points he
was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one brick in hand.
On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the street with the one
he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of countenance and to answer
no questions. Once back at the museum, he was to enter, walk around
inside, then leave through the back door and make the same bricklaying
circuit again.
On the man’s first walk through the streets, several hundred people
watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers
swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered
the museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep
watching him. Many of them were distracted by the museum’s collections,
and stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the brick man had drawn over
a thousand people into the museum. A few days later the police ordered him
to cease and desist from his walks—the crowds were blocking traffic. The
bricklaying stopped but thousands of New Yorkers had entered the museum,
and many of those had become P. T. Barnum converts.
Even when I’m railed at, I get my quota of renown.
 
PIETRO ARETINO, 1492-1556
 
Barnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking the
street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE MUSIC FOR THE
MILLIONS. What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to
hear the free concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians
he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy
tickets to the museum, where they would be out of earshot of the band’s
noise, and of the booing of the crowd.
THE COURT ARTIST
A work that was voluntarily presented to a prince was bound to seem in
some way special. The artist himself might also try to attract the attention of
the court through his behaviour. In Vasari’s judgment Sodoma was “well
known both for his personal eccentricities and for his reputation as a good
painter.” Because Pope Leo X “found pleasure in such strange, hare-
brained individuals,” he made Sodoma a knight, causing the artist to go
completely out of his mind. Van Mander found it odd that the products of
Cornelis Ketel’s experiments in mouth and foot painting were bought by
notable persons “because of their oddity,” yet Ketel was only adding a
variation to similar experiments by Titian, Ugo da Carpi and Palma
Giovane, who, according to Boschini painted with their fingers “because
they wished to imitate the method used by the Supreme Creator. ” Van
Mander reports that Gossaert attracted the attention of Emperor Charles V
by wearing a fantastic paper costume. In doing so he was adopting the
tactics used by Dinocrates, who, in order to gain access to Alexander the
Great, is said to have appeared disguised as the naked Hercules when the
monarch was sitting in judgment.
THE COURT ARTIST, MARTIN WARNKE, 1993
 
One of the first oddities Barnum toured around the country was Joice
Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he advertised as a
slave who had once been George Washington’s nurse. After several months
the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter to the
papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. “Joice Heth,” he wrote, “is
not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone, india-rubber,
and numberless springs.” Those who had not bothered to see her before
were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her paid to see
her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot was true.
In 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to be a
mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but the
head and body were perfectly joined—it was truly a wonder. After some
research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put together
in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.
He nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country
claiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the
papers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he
showed the specimen in his museum, a national debate had been sparked
over the existence of these mythical creatures. A few months before
Barnum’s campaign, no one had cared or even known about mermaids; now
everyone was talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in
record numbers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject.
A few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb, a
five-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum claimed was an
eleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many
remarkable acts. During this tour Barnum’s name attracted such attention
that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience
with him and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palace. The English press
may have ridiculed Barnum, but Victoria was royally entertained by him,
and respected him ever after.
Interpretation
Barnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting attention: Once
people’s eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For Barnum,
creating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, “Every crowd
has a silver lining.” And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If one person
stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the
same. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given a gentle push, they
will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to
do something different and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the
purpose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and
inexplicable. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers
toward other people, it does so at your expense. Barnum would ruthlessly
suck attention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it
is.
At the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on
attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the attention is
irrelevant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed, or how
slanderously personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum would never
complain. If a newspaper critic reviled him particularly badly, in fact, he
made sure to invite the man to an opening and to give him the best seat in
the house. He would even write anonymous attacks on his own work, just to
keep his name in the papers. From Barnum’s vantage, attention—whether
negative or positive—was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate
in the world for a man who yearns fame, glory, and, of course, power is to
be ignored.
If the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle 
such as jousting ... he will ensure that the horse he has is beautifully 
caparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate 
mottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes of the onlookers 
in his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron.
Baldassare Castighone, 1478-1529
KEYS TO POWER
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born
with. You have to learn to attract attention, “as surely as the lodestone
attracts iron.” At the start of your career, you must attach your name and
reputation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This
image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality
quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is
established, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.
It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of yours
should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad. Nothing
could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan, and
having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate
between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and felt no
need to defend himself. He deliberately courted the image of being a
humbug.
The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great
beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more
talked about than the singular Duc de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost
dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior—he slept
with the king’s mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers but the
king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke’s eccentricities
that he could not bear his absences from the court. It was simple: The
strangeness of the duke’s character attracted attention. Once people were
enthralled by him, they wanted him around at any cost.
Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the
general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set you apart
and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to be
attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this law,
and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.
The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to
remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions
themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention.
Edison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his
discoveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed
fantastic at the time—robots, and machines that could photograph thought
—and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that made the
public talk about him. He did everything he could to make sure that he
received more attention than his great rival Nikola Tesla, who may actually
have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less known.
In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recipients of
that year’s Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to a pair
of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize committee
had actually approached Edison, but he had turned them down, refusing to
share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure than
Tesla’s, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his rival
the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize.
If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for
you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most
famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young
Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention as
a writer of verses, he decided to publish a series of satirical poems
ridiculing the pope and his affection for a pet elephant. The attack put
Aretino in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a
position of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use
such tactics sparingly after you have the public’s attention, when the act can
wear thin.
Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and
varying your method of courting attention. If you don’t, the public will
grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The
game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never
allowed himself to fade into the background; if his name became too
attached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset the public with a
new series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better to create
something ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let viewers grow too
familiar with his work. Understand: People feel superior to the person
whose actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by
playing against their expectations, you both gain their respect and tighten
your hold on their fleeting attention.

The Limelight. The 
actor who steps into this bril- 
liant light attains a heightened 
presence. All eyes are on him. There 
is room for only one actor at a time in 
the limelight’s narrow beam; do what 
ever it takes to make yourself its focus. 
Make your gestures so large, amus-
ing, and scandalous that the 
light stays on you while the 
other actors are left in 
the shadows.
 
 
 
 
 
Authority: Be ostentatious and be seen.... What is not seen is as though it
did not exist.... It was light that first caused all creation to shine forth.
Display fills up many blanks, covers up deficiencies, and gives everything a
second life, especially when it is backed by genuine merit. (Baltasar
Gracián, 1601-1658)
PART II: CREATE AN AIR OF MYSTERY
In a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems enigmatic
instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you are doing or
about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery heightens your
presence; it also creates anticipation—everyone will be watching you to see
what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young
Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils that she
gradually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported
that “a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume
and jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and life
into the satiated society of European cities.” Soon everyone knew the
dancer’s name: Mata Hari.
Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather in
a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra played
music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies. After keeping the audience
waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a startling
costume: a white cotton brassiere covered with Indian-type jewels; jeweled
bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it
concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style
no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in
a trance. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told
stories from Indian mythology and Javanese folktales. Soon the cream of
Paris, and ambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations to
the salon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing
sacred dances in the nude.
The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that she
was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of Java. She
would also talk about time spent in India, how she had learned sacred Hindu
dances there, and how Indian women “can shoot straight, ride horseback,
and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.” By the summer
of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari dance, her
name was on everyone’s lips.
As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter of
a Javanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she had
spent her time “horseback riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.” No one
knew anything certain about her, but journalists did not mind these changes
in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a creature from
the pages of Baudelaire—whatever their imagination wanted to see in this
mysterious woman from the East.
In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.
Crowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now
become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote,
“Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its
voluptuousness, its hypnotizing charm.” Another noted, “If India possesses
such unexpected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores
of the Ganges.”
Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread beyond
Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few years she
performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social circles, and
earned an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed by a woman
of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was arrested in
France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy. Only during
the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from Java or India, had
not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastern blood in her
body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came from the stolid
northern province of Friesland, Holland.
Interpretation
When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in her
pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who flocked
to Paris every year, taking work as artists’ models, nightclub dancers, or
vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergère. After a few years they would
inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end up on the
streets, turning to prostitution, or else returning to the town they cam
