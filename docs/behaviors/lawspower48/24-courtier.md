LAW 24
PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER
JUDGMENT
The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around
power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he
flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most
oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and
there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court.
COURT SOCIETY
It is a fact of human nature that the structure of a court society forms itself
around power. In the past, the court gathered around the ruler, and had
many functions: Besides keeping the ruler amused, it was a way to solidify
the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the
nobility both subordinate and close to the ruler, so that he could keep an eye
on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glorifies
the ruler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must struggle to
please him.
To be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century Arab
traveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported that courtiers
there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they had to
suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell, too.
Mimicry like this appeared in courts all over the world. More troublesome
was the danger of displeasing the ruler—one wrong move spelled death or
exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but not
pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from the
other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to make the
ruler insecure.
Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of
manipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make
everyone else fear their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing
that most things at court are judged by how they seem. Great courtiers are
gracious and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect. Masters of the
word, they never say more than necessary, getting the most out of a
compliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure—people want to
be around them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor
humiliate themselves. Great courtiers become the king’s favorites, enjoying
the benefits of that position. They often end up more powerful than the
ruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence.
Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curiosity.
They reason, according to Machiavelli, “as though heaven, the sun, the
elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and
were different from what they were in ancient times.” There may be no
more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun
revolves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared,
or at least lost its power, but courts and courtiers still exist because power
still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the
laws that govern court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is
much to be learned, then, from great courtiers past and present.
THE TWO DOGS
Barbos, the faithful yard-dog who serves his master zealously, happens to
see his old acquaintance Joujou, the curly lapdog, seated at the window on
a soft down cushion. Sidling fondly up to her, like a child to a parent, he all
but weeps with emotion; and there, under the window. he whines, wags his
tail, and bounds about. “What sort of life do you lead now, Joujoutka, ever
since the master took you into his mansion? You remember, no doubt, how
we often used to suffer hunger out in the yard. What is your present service
like?” “It would be a sin in me to murmur against my good fortune, ”
answers Joujoutka. “My master cannot make enough of me. I live amidst
riches and plenty, and I eat and drink off silver. I frolic with the master, and,
if I get tired, I take my ease on carpets or on a soft couch. And how do you
get on?” “I?” replies Barbos, letting his tail dangle like a whip, and
hanging his head. “I live as I used to do. I suffer from cold and hunger; and
here, while guarding my master’s house, I have to sleep at the foot of the
wall, and I get drenched in the rain. And if I bark at the wrong time, I am
whipped. But how did you, Joujou, who were so small and weak, get taken
into favor, while I jump out of my skin to no purpose?
What is it you do?” “‘What is it you do?’ A pretty question to ask!” replied
Joujou, mockingly. “I walk upon my hind legs.”
FABLES, IVAN KRILOFF, 1768-1844
THE LAWS OF COURT POLITICS
Avoid Ostentation. It is never prudent to prattle on about yourself or call
too much attention to your actions. The more you talk about your deeds the
more suspicion you cause. You also stir up enough envy among your peers
to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in
trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk less about yourself
than about other people. Modesty is generally preferable.
 
Practice Nonchalance. Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent
must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for a
genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of
sweat, make it look effortless—people prefer to not see your blood and toil,
which is another form of ostentation. It is better for them to marvel at how
gracefully you have achieved your accomplishment than to wonder why it
took so much work.
Be Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that your superiors cannot get
enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value. It also
stirs up suspicion among your peers. Learn to flatter indirectly—by
downplaying your own contribution, for example, to make your master look
better.
It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude.
To make enemies by unnecessary and wilful incivility, is just as insane a
proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is like a counter—an
avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be stingy. A sensible man will
be generous in the use of it.... Wax, a substance naturally hard and brittle,
can be made soft by the application of a little warmth, so that it will take
any shape you please. In the same way, by being polite and friendly, you
can make people pliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be
crabbed and malevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth
is to wax.
 
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
 
Arrange to Be Noticed. There is a paradox: You cannot display yourself
too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis
XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instantly in the court
hierarchy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in
the swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a
matter of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay attention to your physical
appearance, then, and find a way to create a distinctive—a subtly distinctive
—style and image.
 
Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are
Dealing With. The pseudo-belief in equality—the idea that talking and
acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you
somehow a paragon of civilization—is a terrible mistake. Those below you
will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you
will be offended, although they may not admit it. You must change your
style and your way of speaking to suit each person. This is not lying, it is
acting, and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Learn the art. This is also
true for the great variety of cultures found in the modern court: Never
assume that your criteria of behavior and judgment are universal. Not only
is an inability to adapt to another culture the height of barbarism, it puts you
at a disadvantage.
 
Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who
brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. You must struggle
and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad
news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your
approach will gladden your master.
Never Affect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. He does not
want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never approach
him in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of terms—that
is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level, assume a
wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and make the
distance between you clear.
 
Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem obvious, but
there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary—to say
nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You
must learn, however, to couch your advice and criticism as indirectly and as
politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have
made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and
gentleness.
 
Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing irritates a
master more than having to reject someone’s request. It stirs up guilt and
resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop.
Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always better to earn your
favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask
for favors on another person’s behalf, least of all a friend’s.
 
Never Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous
disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig
your own grave.
 
Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of
others. If you constantly criticize your equals or subordinates some of that
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever
you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will
irritate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people’s
achievements, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to
express wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and
dying talent, but one still greatly valued.
 
Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a
mirror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You
must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see yourself as others see
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of
blunders.
Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must learn to cry
and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be able both to
disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and
agreement. You must be the master of your own face. Call it lying if you
like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and
upfront, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant.
 
Fit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affectation of a past era can be
charming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back;
wearing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role
of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times,
even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking,
however, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand
out too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the
spirit of the times.
 
Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human
nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and
the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the
flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of
unpleasantness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food
and drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or
unappreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of
favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all
control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.
A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and 
of his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad offices, 
smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his passions, 
belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.
Jean de La Bruyère, 1645-1696
SCENES OF COURT LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal
Mistakes
Scene I
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle
East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and mentor,
and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and his
master’s teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his long
campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical
matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a
former pupil of Aristotle’s and a promising philosopher in his own right,
along on the next campaign.
Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a courtier, but
the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in
unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning
so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his
mind. During one of Alexander’s major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.
Interpretation
In court, honesty is a fool’s game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe
that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how
accurate they are.
Scene II
Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars
compiled a series of writings called the 21 Histories, an official biography
of each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war
chronicles. Each history also contained a chapter called “Unusual Events,”
and here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would
sometimes suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as
two-headed sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in
different parts of the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically
verified, but the monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly
inserted on purpose, and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this
mean?
The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man—he was a force
of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and everything
revolved around him. He embodied the world’s perfection. To criticize him
or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order. No
minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest
cautionary word. But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered
greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the
court chronicles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read
of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was
being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to
change.
Interpretation
For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was
an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to
warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criticisms had to be
indirect—yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The
chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of
criticism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor
know the gravity of the situation.
Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imagines
that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him he sees the
person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers, you
must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and other
indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without putting
your neck on the line.
Scene III
Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received
commissions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV.
For each design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed
Louis’s instructions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty.
The courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart’s technique in dealing with
the king: “His particular skill was to show the king plans that purposely
included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the gardens,
which were not Mansart’s specialty. The king, as Mansart expected, would
put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to solve it, at which
point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would never have seen
the problem that the king had so masterfully found and solved; he would
burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he was but a lowly
pupil.” At the age of thirty, having used these methods time and time again,
Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Although he was less
talented and experienced than a number of other French designers, he was
to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles. He was the king’s architect
from then on.
Interpretation
As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the service
of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but
through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart
always strove to make Louis feel better about himself, to feed the king’s
vanity as publicly as possible.
Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the
courtier’s art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time on
your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of all
is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around him.
Scene IV
Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic
court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated,
had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these
meetings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to
immortalize the historic events in an epic painting.
When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for the
French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings, the
statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the painting.
Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the main
negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much the same
thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the great duke
should indeed be the center of attention.
Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spotlight
to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift, stirring up all
sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord were critical. When
the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and Wellington
felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled with
diplomats and politicians from all over Europe. On one side the Duke of
Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is the
“center” of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits
Talleyrand.
Interpretation
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in
one stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are
common in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he
