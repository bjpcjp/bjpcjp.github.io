LAW 21
PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER—SEEM DUMBER
THAN YOUR MARK
JUDGMENT
No one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to
make your victims feel smart—and not just smart, but smarter than you are.
Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior
motives.
In the winter of 1872, the U.S. financier Asbury Harpending was visiting
London when he received a cable: A diamond mine had been discovered in
the American West. The cable came from a reliable source—William
Ralston, owner of the Bank of California—but Harpending nevertheless
took it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of huge
diamond mines in South Africa. True, when reports had first come in of
gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been
skeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the
West! Harpending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron
Rothschild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke.
The baron, however, replied, “Don’t be too sure about that. America is a
very large country. It has furnished the world with many surprises already.
Perhaps it has others in store.” Harpending promptly took the first ship back
to the States.
Now, there is nothing of which a man is prouder than of interlecutal ability,
for it is this that gives him his commanding place in the animal world. It is
an exceedingly rash thing to ter anyone see that you are decidedly superior
to him in this respect, and to let other people see it too.... hence, white rank
and riches may always reckon upon deferential treatment in society, that is
something which intellectual ability can never expect To be ignorea is the
greatest favour shown to it; and if people notice it at all, it is because they
regard it us a piece of imperinence, or else as something to which its
possessor has no legitimate right, and upon which he dares to pride
himself; and in retaliation and revenge for his conduct, people secretly try
and humiliare him in some other way; unit if they wait to ao this, it is only
for a futing opporunity. A man may be as humble as possible in his
demeanour and yet hardly ever get people to overlook his crime in standing
intellectually above them. In the Garden of Roses, Sadi makes the remark:
“You should know that foolish people are a hundredfold more averse to
meeting the wise than the wise are indisposed for the company of the
foolish.”
On the other hand, it is a real recommendation to be stupid. For just as
warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does the mind good to feel its
superiority; and a man will seek company likely to give him this feeling, as
instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk in the sun if he wants
to get warm. But this means that he will be disliked on account of his
superiority; and if a man is to be liked, he must really be inferior in point of
intellect.
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
When Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in the
air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s. Two crusty prospectors
named Philip Arnold and John Slack had been the ones to find the diamond
mine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led a highly
respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular route so
he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had watched as
the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert had taken
the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their worth at
$1.5 million.
Harpending and Ralston now asked Arnold and Slack to accompany them
back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify the
original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily—they smelled a
trap: How could they trust these city slickers? What if Tiffany and the
financiers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston
tried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another
$300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid
an additional $300,000. The miners agreed.
The little group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held at the
mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city’s aristocracy was in
attendance—General George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union
forces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor of
the newspaper the New York Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany.
Only Slack and Arnold were missing—as tourists in the city, they had
decided to go sight-seeing.
When Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a fortune, the
financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Rothschild and
other tycoons to tell them about the diamond mine and inviting them to
share in the investment. At the same time, they also told the prospectors that
they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining expert of their
choosing accompany Slack and Arnold to the site to verify its wealth. The
prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said, they had to
return to San Francisco. The jewels that Tiffany had examined they left with
Harpending for safekeeping.
Several weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining expert in
the country, met the prospectors in San Francisco. Janin was a born skeptic
who was determined to make sure that the mine was not a fraud.
Accompanying Janin were Harpending, and several other interested
financiers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team
through a complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their
whereabouts. Arriving at the site, the financiers watched in amazement as
Janin dug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding
emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and most of all diamonds. The dig lasted eight
days, and by the end, Janin was convinced: He told the investors that they
now possessed the richest field in mining history. “With a hundred men and
proper machinery,” he told them, “I would guarantee to send out one
million dollars in diamonds every thirty days.”
Returning to San Francisco a few days later, Ralston, Harpending, and
company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors.
First, however, they had to get rid of Arnold and Slack. That meant hiding
their excitement—they certainly did not want to reveal the field’s real value.
So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right, they told the
prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the
prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men
that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being
fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the
corporation ; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offered—an
enormous sum at the time—and put their greed aside. This the prospectors
seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return
signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.
News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors fanned out across
Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions
they had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best
men in the business, and furnishing luxurious offices in New York and San
Francisco.
A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the hard
truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake. They
were ruined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in the world
into the biggest scam of the century.
Interpretation
Arnold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake
engineer or bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All of them
honestly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems.
What had fooled them all was nothing else than Arnold and Slack
themselves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such hayseeds, so naive,
that no one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam.
The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid than
the mark—the deceiver’s First Commandment.
The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Arnold and
Slack announced the “discovery” of the diamond mine, they traveled to
Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then salted
the “mine” with these gems, which the first expert dug up and brought to
San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, including
Tiffany himself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly
overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $100,000 as
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before returning to
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many more
jewels to be found.
The effectiveness of the scheme, however, rested not on tricks like these
but on the fact that Arnold and Slack played their parts to perfection. On
their trip to New York, where they mingled with millionaires and tycoons,
they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a size or
two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the big city.
No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be conning
the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine’s existence,
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world’s most
successful businessmen.
In the end, Harpending’s reputation was ruined and he never recovered;
Rothschild learned his lesson and never fell for another con; Slack took his
money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Arnold simply went
home to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had been
legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had run out
of diamonds, that was their problem. Arnold used the money to greatly
enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his own.
KEYS TO POWER
The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost
intolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: “He only has book
knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge.” “Her parents paid for her to
get a good education. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been
as privileged....” “He’s not as smart as he thinks.” Last but not least: “She
may know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she’s
really not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics.”
Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people’s vanity, it
is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person’s brain power.
That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work for you,
it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Subliminally reassure people
that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a bit of a
moron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellectual
superiority you give them will disarm their suspicion-muscles.
In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to
sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and
against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to
get the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian negotiator, Count Blome,
was an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said
that he could judge a man’s character by the way he played quinze.
Bismarck knew of this saying of Blome’s.
The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently
engaged Blome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would later write, “That
was the very last time I ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that
everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the
time], but I succeeded in fooling [Blome], for he believed me to be more
venturesome than I am and I gave way.” Besides appearing reckless,
Bismarck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and
bumbling about with a surplus of nervous energy.
All this made Blome feel he had gathered valuable information. He knew
that Bismarck was aggressive—the Prussian already had that reputation,
and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, Blome knew,
can be foolish and rash. Accordingly, when the time came to sign the treaty,
Blome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bismarck, he
thought, is incapable of cold-blooded calculation and deception, so he only
glanced at the treaty before signing it—he failed to read the fine print. As
soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face, “Well, I
could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat willing to
sign that document!”
The Chinese have a phrase, “Masquerading as a swine to kill the tiger.”
This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter clothes
himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The mighty
tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close, savoring the
prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh.
Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are
arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the
more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are
ambitious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent
than you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a
harmless pig and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They
may even promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius
before he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later
became Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they
might have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they
were left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with
vigor and decisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard.
Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there? Taste
and sophistication rank close to intelligence on the vanity scale; make
people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard will
come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naivete can
work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their
backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make
people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They
will keep you around because you make them feel better about themselves,
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to
deceive them.
Image: 
The Opossum. In playing 
dead, the opossum plays stupid. 
Many a predator has therefore left it 
alone. Who could believe that such an 
ugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature 
could be capable of such deception?
 
 
 
Authority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man plays this
card at times. There are occasions when the highest wisdom consists in
appearing not to know—you must not be ignorant but capable of playing it.
It is not much good being wise among fools and sane among lunatics. He
who poses as a fool is not a fool. The best way to be well received by all is
to clothe yourself in the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Gracián,
1601-1658)
REVERSAL
To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in
the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the
truth—that you are actually much smarter than you look—they will admire
you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the
start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You
may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter than
the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you should
to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.
There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite—when
you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters of
smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to have
authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can be
very useful in getting you out of a scrape.
The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soiree at the New
York home of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Dürer painting for a
high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed
extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the
tycoon’s daughter showed him the Dürer, which had not yet been hung. The
critic studied it for a time, then finally said, “You know, I don’t think this
Dürer is right.” He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell her
father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled,
turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen just laughed. “How very
amusing,” he said. “Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other
art experts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that
painting isn’t genuine? And now you’ve made the same mistake.” His
confident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who
apologized for his mistake.
Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that many
paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best to
distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often overplayed
a work’s authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer believed he
had bought a Dürer, and that Duveen himself convinced everyone of his
“expertness” through his air of irreproachable authority. Thus, it is
important to be able to play the professor when necessary and never impose
such an attitude for its own sake.
