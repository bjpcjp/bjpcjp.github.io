LAW 1
NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER
JUDGMENT
Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to
please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you
might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your
masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights
of power.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
was a generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry. He
also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was clever
and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime minister, Jules
Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be named the
successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This and other
signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and so he
decided to ingratiate himself with the king by staging the most spectacular
party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose would be to
commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s château, Vaux-le-Vicomte, but
its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of honor.
The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds of
the time—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné attended
the party. Molière wrote a play for the occasion, in which he himself was to
perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a lavish seven-
course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never before tasted in France,
as well as new dishes created especially for the night. The meal was
accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to honor the king.
After dinner there was a promenade through the château’s gardens. The
grounds and fountains of Vaux-le-Vicomte were to be the inspiration for
Versailles.
Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the
geometrically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving
at the gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was
followed by the performance of Molière’s play. The party ran well into the
night and everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever
attended.
The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,
D’Artagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
done on the king’s behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in
solitary confinement.
Interpretation
Louis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be
the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being outdone
in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To succeed
Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his
parsimony and for giving the dullest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure that
any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis’s hands.
With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than Fouquet’s
—the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects, decorators,
and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties even more
extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.
Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet
presented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the
one before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion
to the king. Not only did he think the party would put him back in the king’s
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his
popularity, making him indispensable to the king and demonstrating that he
would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new
spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet, made
it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more charmed by
the finance minister than by the king himself, and that Fouquet was actually
flaunting his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis XIV, Fouquet’s
elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would not admit this to
anyone, of course—instead, he found a convenient excuse to rid himself of
a man who had inadvertently made him feel insecure.
Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master’s sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pre-
eminence.
When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world. 
By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom. 
Voltaire, 1694-1778
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the early 1600s, the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo found
himself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of great
rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists, he
would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the leading
patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a military compass he
had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a book explaining
the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were grateful, and
through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach. No matter
how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him with gifts,
not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and dependence. There
must be an easier way, he thought.
Galileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the moons of
Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons—giving one
the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on—as he
had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established the
Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods, the
Medici symbol—a symbol of a power that went beyond politics and
banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.
Galileo turned his discovery of Jupiter’s moons into a cosmic event
honoring the Medicis’ greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced
that “the bright stars [the moons of Jupiter] offered themselves in the
heavens” to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II’s enthronement. He
said that the number of the moons—four—harmonized with the number of
the Medicis (Cosimo II had three brothers) and that the moons orbited
Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty’s founder.
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected
the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to the
Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter sitting on a
cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented this to Cosimo II
as a symbol of his link to the stars.
In 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and
mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a
lifetime. The days of begging for patronage were over.
Interpretation
In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in
years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more
brilliant than other people.
They do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest invention ;
they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis
infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had
by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.
Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They
too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great
intellectual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only
there to supply the funds—an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great
work wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He
wants to appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the
work produced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give him glory.
Galileo did not challenge the intellectual authority of the Medicis with his
discovery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them
with the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He
did not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.
KEYS TO POWER
Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and
display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and
other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend
your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,
however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power,
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.
Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the
days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life
are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and
superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting your
gifts and talents, you are winning the master’s affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.
This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can
inadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecure; you may
naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.
No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of Faenza.
The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated his
subjects with his generosity and open spirit.
In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress,
executed none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the
time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.
A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River Tiber,
a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with some
sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real problem
was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man was
outshining him without even trying. Given Manfredi’s natural talents, the
prince’s mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charismatic.
The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and superior, you
must learn to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a way to
mute your good qualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.
Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do
anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In late-
sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had
become an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi’s most
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored
throughout Japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced to
death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change of
fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and later
court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing sandals (a
sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in the
most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the royalty
who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had no
sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the
highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the emperor,
and had come to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was an
unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it with
his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for granted and
never let any favors you receive go to your head.
Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law to
your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt
flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and
looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If you
are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite: Make
him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that you
need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the
long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such
requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience
may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.
If your ideas are more creative than your master’s, ascribe them to him,
in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is merely
an echo of his advice.
If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court
jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone
down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem the
dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable
and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks his
radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which everyone
revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you are
thrust into the position of entertaining him, a display of your limited means
may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress him with your grace
and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price.
In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in
the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in
control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in
handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo,
you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you
are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.
Image: 
The Stars in the 
Sky. There can be only 
one sun at a time. Never 
obscure the sunlight, or 
rival the sun’s brilliance; 
rather, fade into the sky and 
find ways to heighten 
the master star’s 
intensity.
Authority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious, but the
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal. This is a
lesson that the stars in the sky teach us—they may be related to the sun, and
just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar Gracián,
1601-1658)
REVERSAL
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you
must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing
to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful—your master had no such
scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsmart him at
key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.
Do not risk outshining a feeble superior—it might appear cruel or spiteful.
But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the
more capable, bide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of
things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall
someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and someday outshine
him.
