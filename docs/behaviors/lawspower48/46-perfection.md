LAW 46
NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT
JUDGMENT
Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of
all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent
enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless
vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable.
Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Joe Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts,
London, in 1953, where both had enrolled as acting students. They soon
became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty-five at the time,
was seven years older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the
two; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having
settled down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up
acting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell’s inheritance was
enough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the
beginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they
wrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts,
occasionally interjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted
some interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had
shown was leading nowhere.
Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for
work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The
future looked bleak.
In 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn’t until five years
later, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of
library books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This
was the first time he and Halliwell had been separated in nine years). He
came out of prison determined to express his contempt for English society
in the form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell moved back in together,
but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the writing while Halliwell put
in comments and ideas.
In 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-length play, Entertaining
Mr.Sloane . The play made it to London’s West End, where it received
brilliant reviews: A great new writer had emerged from nowhere. Now
success followed success, at a dizzying pace. In 1966 Orton had a hit with
his play Loot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from
all sides, including from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write
them a film script.
Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton’s relationship
with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived together, but as Orton grew
successful, Halliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his lover become the
center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of
personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a
collaboration growing smaller and smaller. In the 1950s he had supported
Orton with his inheritance; now Orton supported him. At a party or among
friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton—he was charming,
and his mood was almost always buoyant. Unlike the handsome Orton,
Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people want to
avoid him.
THE PARABLE OF THE GREEDY MAN AND THE ENVIOUS
MAN
A greedy man and an envious man met a king. The king said to them, “One
of you may ask something of me and I will give it to him, provided I give
twice as much to the other. ” The envious person did not want to ask first
for he was envious of his companion who would receive twice as much, and
the greedy man did not want to ask first since he wanted everything that
was to be had. Finally the greedy one pressed the envious one to be the first
to make the request. So the envious person asked the king to pluck out one
of his eyes.
JEWISH PARABLE, THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, SOLOMON
SCHIMMEL, 1992
An admirer who feels that he cannot be happy by surrendering himself
elects to become envious of that which he admires. So he speaks another
language—the thing which he really admires is called a stupid, insipid and
queer sort of thing. Admiration is happy self-surrender; envy is unhappy
self-assertion.
SØREN KIERKEGAARD, 1813-1855
With Orton’s success the couple’s problems only worsened. Halliwell’s
moods made their life together impossible. Orton claimed to want to leave
him, and had numerous affairs, but would always end up returning to his old
friend and lover. He tried to help Halliwell launch a career as an artist, even
arranging for a gallery to show his work, but the show was a flop, and this
only heightened Halliwell’s sense of inferiority. In May of 1967, the pair
went on a brief holiday together in Tangier, Morocco. During the trip, Orton
wrote in his diary, “We sat talking of how happy we felt. And how it
couldn’t, surely, last. We’d have to pay for it. Or we’d be struck down from
afar by disaster because we were, perhaps, too happy. To be young, good-
looking, healthy, famous, comparatively rich and happy is surely going
against nature.”
Halliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though, he was
seething. And two months later, in the early morning of August 10, 1967,
just days after helping Orton put the finishing touches to the wicked farce
What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece), Kenneth Halliwell
bludgeoned Joe Orton to death with repeated blows of a hammer to the
head. He then took twenty-one sleeping pills and died himself, leaving
behind a note that read, “If you read Orton’s diary all will be explained.”
Interpretation
Kenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but
what Joe Orton’s diaries revealed to him was the truth: It was envy, pure
and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halliwell
read on the sly, recounted the couple’s days as equals and their struggle for
recognition. After Orton found success, the diaries began to describe
Halliwell’s brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing sense of
inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered on
contempt.
The diaries made clear Halliwell’s bitterness over Orton’s success.
Eventually the only thing that would have satisfied him would have been
for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that
they could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years
before. When the opposite happened—as Orton grew only more successful
and popular—Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals
again: He made them equals in death. With Orton’s murder, he became
almost as famous as his friend—posthumously.
Joe Orton only partly understood his lover’s deterioration. His attempt to
help Halliwell launch a career in art registered for what it was: charity and
guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem. He could
have downplayed his own success, displaying some faults, deflecting
Halliwell’s envy; or, once he realized the nature of the problem, he could
have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in fact he was—a viper of envy.
Once envy eats away at someone, everything you do only makes it grow,
and day by day it festers inside him. Eventually he will attack.
It takes great talent and skill to conceal one’s talent and skill
 
LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, 1613-1680
 
ENVY TORMENTS AGLAUROS
The goddess Minerva made her way to the house of Envy, a house filthy
with dark and noisome slime. It is hidden away in the depths of the valleys,
where the sun never penetrates, where no wind blows through; a gloomy
dwelling, permeated by numbing chill, ever fireless, ever shrouded in thick
darkness. When Minerva reached this spot she stopped in front of the house
... and struck the doors with the tip of her spear, and at the blow they flew
open and revealed Envy within, busy at a meal of snake’s flesh, the food on
which she nourished her wickedness. At the sight, Minerva turned her eyes
away. But the other rose heavily from the ground, leaving the half-eaten
corpses, and came out with dragging steps. When she saw the goddess in all
the brilliance of her beauty, in her flashing armor, she groaned.... Envy’s
face was sickly pale, her whole body lean and wasted, and she squinted
horribly; her teeth were discolored and decayed, her poisonous breast of a
greenish hue, and her tongue dripped venom. Only the sight of suffering
could bring a smile to her lips. She never knew the comfort of sleep, but was
kept constantly awake by care and anxiety, looked with dismay on men’s
good fortune, and grew thin at the sight. Gnawing at others, and being
gnawed, she was herself her own torment. Minerva, in spite of her loathing,
yet addressed her briefly: “Instill your poison into one of Cecrop’s
daughters—her name is Aglauros. This is what I require of you. ” Without
another word she pushed against the ground with her spear, left the earth,
and soared upwards.
From the corner of her eye the other watched the goddess out of sight,
muttering and angry that Minerva’s plan should be successful. Then she
took her staff, all encircled with thorny briars, wrapped herself in dark
clouds, and set forth. Wherever she went she trampled down the flowery
fields, withered up the grass, seared the treetops, and with her breath
tainted the peoples, their cities and their homes, until at length she came to
Athens, the home of wit and wealth, peaceful and prosperous. She could
scarcely refrain from weeping when she saw no cause for tears. Then
entering the chamber of Cecrop’s daughter, she carried out Minerva’s
orders. She touched the girl’s breast with a hand dipped in malice, filled her
heart with spiky thorns, and breathing in a black and evil poison dispersed
it through her very bones, instilling the venom deep in her heart. That the
reason for her distress might not be far to seek, she set before Aglauros’
eyes a vision of her sister, of that sister’s fortunate marriage [with the god
Mercury], and of the god in all his handsomeness; and she exaggerated the
glory of it all. So Aglauros was tormented by such thoughts, and the jealous
anger she concealed ate into her heart. Day and night she sighed,
unceasingly wretched, and in her utter misery wasted away in a slow
decline, as when ice is melted by the fitful sun. The fire that was kindled
within her at the thought of her sister’s luck and good fortune was like the
burning of weeds which do not burst into flames, but are none the less
consumed by smoldering fire.
METAMORPHOSES, OVID, 43 B.C.-C. A.D. 18
Only a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority
inevitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success happens
your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in your own circle,
the friends and acquaintances you have left behind. Feelings of inferiority
gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens their feelings of
stagnation. Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard calls “unhappy
admiration,” takes hold. You may not see it but you will feel it someday—
unless, that is, you learn strategies of deflection, little sacrifices to the gods
of success. Either dampen your brilliance occasionally, purposefully
revealing a defect, weakness, or anxiety, or attributing your success to luck;
or simply find yourself new friends. Never underestimate the power of
envy.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
The merchant class and the craft guilds to which medieval Florence owed
its prosperity had created a republic that protected them from oppression by
the nobility. Since high office could only be held for a few months, no one
could gain lasting dominance, and although this meant that the political
factions struggled constantly for control, the system kept out tyrants and
petty dictators. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this
system without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as
apothecaries, and were typical middle-class citizens. Not until the late
fourteenth century, when Giovanni de’ Medici made a modest fortune in
banking, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with.
Upon Giovanni’s death, his son Cosimo took over the family business,
and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under his
control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking families
of Europe. But they had a rival in Florence: Despite the city’s republican
system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to monopolize
control of the government, forging alliances that allowed them to constantly
fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not fight this, and in
fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, while the Albizzis
were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a point of staying in the
background.
Eventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and in
1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their government
muscle to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the
republic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others
feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled him from
Florence. Cosimo did not fight the sentence; he left quietly. Sometimes, he
knew, it is wiser to bide one’s time and keep a low profile.
Over the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they were
setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to
advantage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even from
exile. A civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the
Albizzis were toppled from power and sent into exile. Cosimo immediately
returned to Florence, his position restored. But he saw that he now faced a
delicate situation: If he seemed ambitious, as the Albizzis had, he would stir
up opposition and envy that would ultimately threaten his business. If he
stayed on the sidelines, on the other hand, he would leave an opening for
another faction to rise up as the Albizzis had, and to punish the Medicis for
their success.
Cosimo solved the problem in two ways: He secretly used his wealth to
buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own allies, all cleverly
enlisted from the middle classes to disguise their allegiance to him, in top
government positions. Those who complained of his growing political clout
were taxed into submission, or their properties were bought out from under
them by Cosimo’s banker allies. The republic survived in name only.
Cosimo held the strings.
While he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publicly
Cosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of
Florence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one servant,
and bowed deferentially to magistrates and elder citizens. He rode a mule
instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import, even
though he controlled Florence’s foreign affairs for over thirty years. He
gave money to charities and maintained his ties to Florence’s merchant
class. He financed all kinds of public buildings that fed the Florentines’
pride in their city. When he built a palace for himself and his family in
nearby Fiesole, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi had
drawn up for him and instead chose a modest structure designed by
Michelozzo, a man of humble Florentine origins. The palace was a symbol
of Cosimo’s strategy—all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and
opulence within.
Cosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The citizens of
Florence wanted to build him a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory
with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be
buried without “any pomp or demonstration.” Some sixty years later,
Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, “for he knew how
extraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much
more envied than those that are done in deed and are covered over with
decency.”
Interpretation
A close friend of Cosimo’s, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, once
wrote of him, “And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it,
in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to
come from others, and not from him.” One of Cosimo’s favorite expressions
was, “Envy is a weed that should not be watered.” Understanding the power
envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appearance of
greatness. This does not mean that greatness should be suffocated, or that
only the mediocre should survive; only that a game of appearances must be
played. The insidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected quite
easily: Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with those
below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their support in
times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal the degree to
which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to others, as if
they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de’ Medici perfected this game;
he was a consummate con artist of appearances. No one could gauge the
extent of his power—his modest exterior hid the truth.
Never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by
flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware
of their inferior position, you are only stirring up “unhappy admiration,” or
envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you
cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories.
The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over
others is inconsequential next to the reality of it.
Of all the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to.
Plutarch, c. A.D 46-120
The envious hides as carefully as the secret, lustful sinner and becomes the
endless inventor of tricks and stratagems to hide and mask himself. Thus he
is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of others which eats up his heart,
as if he did not see them, nor hear them, nor were aware of them, nor had
ever heard of them. He is a master simulator. On the other hand he tries
with all his power to connive and thus prevent any form of superiority from
appearing in any situation. And if they do, he casts on them obscurity,
hypercriticism, sarcasm and calumny like the toad that spits poison from its
hole. On the other hand he will raise endlessly insignificant men, mediocre
people, and even the inferior in the same type of activities.
 
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
 
For not many men, the proverb says, can love a friend who fortune prospers
without feeling envy; and about the envious brain, cold poison clings and
doubles all the pain life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse, and
feels another’s gladness like a curse.
 
AESCHYLUS, c. 525-456 B.C.
 
KEYS TO POWER
The human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In
the face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often disturbed and ill at
ease; this is because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves, and
when we meet people who surpass us they make it clear to us that we are in
fact mediocre, or at least not as brilliant as we had thought. This disturbance
in our self-image cannot last long without stirring up ugly emotions. At first
we feel envy: If only we had the quality or skill of the superior person, we
would be happy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any closer to
equality. Nor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially—to
show envy is to admit to feeling inferior. To close friends, we may confess
our secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy. So
it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding grounds to
criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be smarter than I am, we
say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power, but
that’s because he cheats. If we do not slander him, perhaps we praise him
excessively—another of envy’s disguises.
There are several strategies for dealing with the insidious
