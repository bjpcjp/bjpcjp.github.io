LAW 36
DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM
IS THE BEST REVENGE
JUDGMENT
By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The
more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small
mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is
sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but
cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more
superior you seem.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
The Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa started out as the chief of a gang of
bandits, but after revolution broke out in Mexico in 1910, he became a kind
of folk hero—robbing trains and giving the money to the poor, leading
daring raids, and charming the ladies with romantic escapades. His exploits
fascinated Americans—he seemed a man from another era, part Robin
Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however, General
Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated Villa and his
troops went back home, to the northern state of Chihuahua. His army
dwindled and he turned to banditry again, damaging his popularity. Finally,
perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the United States, the
gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles.
In March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico.
Rampaging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American
soldiers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like many Americans,
had admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished.
Wilson’s advisers urged him to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa.
For a power as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at
an army that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal.
Furthermore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a
principle the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove
his mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force.
The pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was out, with
the approval of the Carranza government, he sent an army of ten thousand
soldiers to capture Pancho Villa. The venture was called the Punitive
Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J. Pershing, who
had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native Americans in the
American Southwest. Certainly Pershing could find and overpower Pancho
Villa.
The Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads of U.S.
reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote, would
be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in weaponry,
communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnaissance from the air.
In the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the
wilds of northern Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 reward for
information leading to Villa’s capture. But the Mexican people, who had
been disillusioned with Villa when he had returned to banditry, now
idolized him for facing this mighty American army. They began to give
Pershing false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain
hideaway, airplanes would be dispatched, troops would scurry after them,
and no one would ever see him. The wily bandit seemed to be always one
step ahead of the American military.
THE FOX AND THE GRAPES
A starving fox ... saw a cluster of luscious-looking grapes of purplish luster
Dangling above him on a trellis-frame. He would have dearly liked them for
his lunch, but when he tried and failed to reach the bunch: “Ah well, it’s
more than likely they’re not sweet—Good only for green fools to eat!”
 
Wasn’t he wise to say they were unripe Rather than whine and gripe?
FABLES, JEAN DE LA FONTAINE, 1621-1695
Once when G. K. Chesterton’s economic views were abused in print by
George Bernard Shaw, his friends waited in vain for him to reply. Historian
Hilaire Belloc reproached him. “My dear Belloc,” Chesterton said, “I have
answered him. To a man of Shaw’s wit, silence is the one unbearable
repartee.
THE LITTLE, BROWN BOOK OF ANECDOTES, CLIFTON FADIMAN,
ED., 1985
By the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to 123,000 men.
They suffered through the stultifying heat, the mosquitoes, the wild terrain.
Trudging over a countryside in which they were already resented, they
infuriated both the local people and the Mexican government. At one point
Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to recover from a gunshot wound he
received in a skirmish with the Mexican army; looking down from his aerie,
he could watch Pershing lead the exhausted American troops back and forth
across the mountains, never getting any closer to their goal.
All the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and-mouse game. Americans
came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick farce—in fact they began to
admire Villa again, respecting his resourcefulness in eluding a superior
force. In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing’s withdrawal. As
the troops made their way back to American territory, rebel forces pursued
them, forcing the U.S. Army to use airplanes to protect its rear flanks. The
Punitive Expedition was being punished itself—it had turned into a retreat
of the most humiliating sort.
Interpretation
Woodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of force: He
would teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the world that no
one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and get away with
it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa would be
forgotten.
That was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took, the more
it focused attention on the Americans’ incompetence and on Villa’s
cleverness. Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid that had
started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrassment,
and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance between
the size of the pursuer and the size of the pursued—who still managed to
stay free—made the affair a joke. And in the end this white elephant of an
army had to lumber out of Mexico, humiliated. The Punitive Expedition did
the opposite of what it set out to do: It left Villa not only free but more
popular than ever.
What could Wilson have done differently? He could have pressured the
Carranza government to catch Villa for him. Alternatively, since many
Mexicans had tired of Villa before the Punitive Expedition began, he could
have worked quietly with them and won their support for a much smaller
raid to capture the bandit. He could have organized a trap on the American
side of the border, anticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored the
matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans themselves to
do away with Villa of their own accord.
THE ASS AND THE GARDENER
An ass had once by some accident lost his tail, which was a grievous
affliction to him; and he was everywhere seeking after it, being fool enough
to think he could get it set on again. He passed through a meadow, and
afterwards got into a garden. The gardener seeing him, and not able to
endure the mischief he was doing in trampling down his plants, fell into a
violent rage, ran to the ass, and never standing on the ceremony of a
pillory, cut off both his ears, and beat him out of the ground. Thus the ass,
who bemoaned the loss of his tail, was in far greater affliction when he saw
himself without ears.

THE PRODIGY OX
Once, when the Tokudaiji minister of the right was chief of the imperial
police, he was holding a meeting of his staff at the middle gate when an ox
belonging to an official named Akikane got loose and wandered into the
ministry building. It climbed up on the dais where the chief was seated and
lay there, chewing its cud. Everyone was sure that this was some grave
portent, and urged that the ox be sent to a yin-yang diviner. However, the
prime minister, the father of the minister of the right, said, “An ox has no
discrimination. It has legs—there is nowhere it won’t go. It does not make
sense to deprive an underpaid official of the wretched ox he needs in order
to attend court.” He returned the ox to its owner and changed the matting
on which it had lain. No untoward event of any kind occurred afterward.
They say that if you see a prodigy and do not treat it as such, its character
as a prodigy is destroyed.
ESSAYS IN IDLENESS, KENKO, JAPAN, FOURTEENTH CENTURY
Remember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily
choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial and
unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful move. What you do not
react to cannot drag you down in a futile engagement. Your pride is not
involved. The best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to
oblivion by ignoring it. If it is impossible to ignore (Pancho Villa had in fact
killed American citizens), then conspire in secret to do away with it, but
never inadvertently draw attention to the bothersome insect that will go
away or die on its own. If you waste time and energy in such
entanglements, it is your own fault. Learn to play the card of disdain and
turn your back on what cannot harm you in the long run.
Just think—it cost your government $130 million to try to get me. I took
them 
over rough, hilly country. Sometimes for fifty miles at a stretch they had no
water. 
They had nothing but the sun and mosquitoes.... And nothing was gained.
Pancho Villa, 1878-1923
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England decided he had to find a way
to get rid of his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had failed to produce
a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty, and
Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage, “And if
a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered
his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” Before marrying Henry,
Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur had died five
months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then had married his
brother’s widow.
Catherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of
Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance. Now,
however, Catherine had to assure him that her brief marriage with Arthur
had never been consummated. Otherwise Henry would view their
relationship as incestuous and their marriage as null and void. Catherine
insisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and
Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which
he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of
marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one
thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incestuous, and God
had punished them.
There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine: He
had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was he in
love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legitimate
son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, however, Henry
had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never annul the
marriage.
By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry
was about to attempt the impossible—to annul his marriage against
Clement’s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily
enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy:
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered
her his sister-in-law, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess
Dowager of Wales, her title as Arthur’s widow. Finally, in 1531, he
banished her from court and shipped her off to a distant castle. The pope
ordered him to return her to court, on pain of excommunication, the most
severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only ignored this threat,
he insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533
he married Anne Boleyn.
Clement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care. He no
longer recognized the pope’s authority, and proceeded to break with the
Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in its stead,
with the king as the head of the new church. And so, not surprisingly, the
newly formed Church of England proclaimed Anne Boleyn England’s
rightful queen.
The pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked. Henry
simply ignored him. Clement fumed—no one had ever treated him so
contemptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of
recourse. Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but never
carried out) would no longer matter.
Catherine too felt the devastating sting of Henry’s disdain. She tried to
fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon
they fell on no one’s. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad with
anger and frustration, Catherine slowly deteriorated, and finally died in
January of 1536, from a cancerous tumor of the heart.
Interpretation
When you pay attention to a person, the two of you become partners of
sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the
process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all interactions: By
acknowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open
yourself to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he
would have found himself mired in endless arguments that would have
weakened his resolve and eventually worn him down. (Catherine was a
strong, stubborn woman.) Had he set out to convince Clement to change his
verdict on the marriage’s validity, or tried to compromise and negotiate with
him, he would have gotten bogged down in Clement’s favorite tactic:
playing for time, promising flexibility, but actually getting what popes
always got—their way.
Henry would have none of this. He played a devastating power game—
total disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unsettles and
infuriates them—but since they have no dealings with you, there is nothing
they can do.
And in this view it is advisable to let everyone of your acquaintance—
whether man or woman—feel now and then that you could very well
dispense with their company. This will consolidate friendship. Nay, with
most people there will be no harm in occasionally mixing a grain of disdain
with your treatment of them; that will make them value your friendship all
the more. Chi non stima vien stimato, as a subtle Italian proverb has it—to
disregard is to win regard. But if we really think very highly of a person, we
should conceal it from him like a crime. This is not a very gratifying thing
to do, but it is right. Why, a dog will not bear being treated too kindly, let
alone a man!
ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 1788-1860
THE MONKEY AND THE PEAS
A monkey was carrying two handfuls of peas. One little pea dropped out.
He tried to pick it up, and spilt twenty. He tried to pick up the twenty, and
spilt them all. Then he lost his temper, scattered the peas in all directions,
and ran away.
FABLES, LEO TOLSTOY, 1828-1910
This is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of contempt is
immensely powerful, for it lets you determine the conditions of the conflict.
The war is waged on your terms. This is the ultimate power pose: You are
the king, and you ignore what offends you. Watch how this tactic infuriates
people—half of what they do is to get your attention, and when you
withhold it from them, they flounder in frustration.
MAN: Kick him—he’ll forgive you. Flatter him—he may or may not 
see through you. But ignore him and he’ll hate you.
Idries Shah, Caravan of Dreams, 1968
As some make gossip out of everything, so others make much ado about
everything. They are always talking big, [and] take everything seriously,
making a quarrel and a mystery of it. You should take very few grievances
to heart, for to do so is to give yourself groundless worry. It is a topsyturvy
way of behaving to take to heart cares which you ought to throw over your
shoulder. Many things which seemed important [at the time] turn out to be
of no account when they are ignored; and others, which seem trifling,
appear formidable when you pay attention to them. Things can easily be
settled at the outset, but not so later on. In many cases, the remedy itself is
the cause of the disease: to let things be is not the least satisfactory of life’s
rules.
BALTASAR GRACIÁN, 1601-1658
KEYS TO POWER
Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want something, the
more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you show,
the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your interest is
too strong—it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrollable desire
makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic.
You need to turn your back on what you want, show your contempt and
disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your targets
crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own, which is simply to have
an effect on you—perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they want
to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of seduction.
If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them play by
your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action).
Contempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he
decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is
as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XIV—if he did not
like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by
cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when you
play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can do
without them.
If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite
approach—commitment and engagement—often weakens you. By paying
undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes you
to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When Athens set out
to conquer the island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., a giant power was attacking a
tiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long-drawn-out conflict, Syracuse,
Sicily’s most important city-state, was able to grow in stature and
confidence. Finally defeating Athens, it made itself famous for centuries to
come. In recent times, President John F. Kennedy made a similar mistake in
his attitude to Fidel Castro of Cuba: His failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs,
in 1961, made Castro an international hero.
A second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you
merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of
Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his
administration spent on government projects, but their attacks had no
resonance with the public, who saw the president as working to end the
Great Depression. His opponents thought they had an example that would
show just how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he lavished
with favors and attention. Critics railed at his insensitivity—spending
taxpayers’ money on a dog while so many Americans were still in poverty.
But Roosevelt had a response: How dare his critics attack a defenseless
little dog? His speech in defense of Fala was one of the most popular he
ever gave. In this case, the weak party involved was the president’s dog and
the attack backfired—in the long run, it only made the president more
sympathetic, since many people will naturally side with the “underdog,”
just as the American public came to sympathize with the wily but
outnumbered Pancho Villa.
It is tempting to want to fix our mistakes, but the harder we try, the worse
we often make them. It is sometimes more politic to leave them alone. In
1971, when the New York Times published the Pentagon Papers, a
