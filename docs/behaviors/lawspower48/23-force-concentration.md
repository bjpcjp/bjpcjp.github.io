LAW 23
CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES
JUDGMENT
Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their
strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper,
than by flitting from one shallow mine to another—intensity defeats
extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find
the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to
come.
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In China in the early sixth century B.C., the kingdom of Wu began a war
with the neighboring northern provinces of the Middle Kingdom. Wu was a
growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Middle
Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the
Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status.
The war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon
bogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies vulnerable
on another. The king’s chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, warned him
that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice the
kingdom of Wu’s problems and had designs to invade. The king only
laughed at such worries—one more big victory and the great Middle
Kingdom would be his.
THE GOOSE AND THE HORSE
A goose who was plucking grass upon a common thought herself affronted
by a horse who fed near her; and, in hissing accents, thus addressed him:
“I am certainly a more noble and perfect animal than you, for the whole
range and extent of your faculties is confined to one element. I can walk
upon the ground as well as you; I have, besides, wings, with which I can
raise myself in the air; and when I please, I can sport on ponds and lakes,
and refresh myself in the cool waters. I enjoy the different powers of a bird,
a fish, and a quadruped.”
The horse, snorting somewhat disdainfully, replied: “It is true you inhabit
three elements, but you make no very distinguished figure in any one of
them. You fly, indeed; but your flight is so heavy and clumsy, that you have
no right to put yourself on a level with the lark or the swallow. You can
swim on the surface of the waters, but you cannot live in them as fishes do;
you cannot find your food in that element, nor glide smoothly along the
bottom of the waves. And when you walk, or rather waddle, upon the
ground, with your broad feet and your long neck stretched out, hissing at
everyone who passes by, you bring upon yourself the derision of all
beholders. I confess that I am only formed to move upon the ground; but
how graceful is my make! How well turned my lunbs! How highly finished
my whole body! How great my strength! How astonishing my speed! I had
much rather be confined to one element, and be admired in that, than be a
goose in all!”
FABLES FROM BOCCAACCIO AND CHAUCER, DR. JOHN AIKIN,
1747-1822
In the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the kingdom
of Ch’i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapproved of the war,
and that he believed the king’s selfish ambition was leading Wu to ruin. The
king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing him of a lack of
loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered him to kill himself. Wu Tzu-hsiu
obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he cried,
“Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I may
see the triumphant entry of Yueh.”
As Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed
beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king
remembered his minister’s last words—and felt the dead man’s
disembodied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his shame, the king
killed himself, “covering his face so that he would not have to meet the
reproachful gaze of his minister in the next world.”
Interpretation
The story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to ruin by
overreaching. Drunk with success and sick with ambition, such empires
expand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is total. This is what
happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily
and ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of
their empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their
vulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe.
Their useless expansion led their empire into oblivion.
For the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental
lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts,
losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. “If you are not in
danger,” says Sun-tzu, “do not fight.” It is almost a physical law: What is
bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not
wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of
purpose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to
its past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls
to the ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
The Rothschild banking family had humble beginnings in the Jewish ghetto
of Frankfurt, Germany. The city’s harsh laws made it impossible for Jews to
mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a virtue—it
made them self-reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at all costs.
Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth by
lending money, in the late eighteenth century, well understood the power
that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion.
First, Mayer Amschel allied himself with one family, the powerful
princes of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made
himself these princes’ primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his
business to outsiders, using only his children and close relatives. The more
unified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon
Mayer Amschel’s five sons were running the business. And when Mayer
Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead
setting up all of his sons to continue the family tradition, so that they would
stay united and would resist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by
outsiders.
Beware of dissipating your powers: strive constantly to concentrate them.
Genius thinks it can do whatever it sees others doing, but it is sure to repent
of every ill-judged outlay.
JOHANN VON GOETHE, 1749-1832
Once Mayer Amschel’s sons controlled the family business, they decided
that the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a foothold in the
finances of Europe as a whole, rather than being tied to any one country or
prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in London.
In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel remained in Frankfurt, Salomon
established himself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went to Naples.
With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their hold on
Europe’s financial markets.
This widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the very
danger of which their father had warned them: diffusion, division,
dissension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the
most powerful force in European finance and politics, by once again
resorting to the strategy of the ghetto—excluding outsiders, concentrating
their forces. The Rothschilds established the fastest courier system in
Europe, allowing them to get news of events before all their competitors.
They held a virtual monopoly on information. And their internal
communications and correspondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and
in a code that only the brothers could decipher. There was no point in
stealing this information—no one could understand it. “Even the shewdest
bankers cannot find their way through the Rothschild maze,” admitted a
financier who had tried to infiltrate the clan.
In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This
presented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating an
outsider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets.
James therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose the daughter
of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic—this was the perfect
solution to their marriage problems. James’s choice now became the family
policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to Salomon’s son.
In the years to come, the five brothers arranged eighteen matches among
their children, sixteen of these being contracted between first cousins.
“We are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,” said
brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved in
concert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the
world, which only saw the movement of the hands. While other rich and
powerful families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultous
first half of the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not
only to preserve but to expand their unprecedented wealth.
Interpretation
The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that
had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the
Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of
upheavals. The Rothchilds kept the past alive, resisted the patterns of
dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of
concentration.
No one represents this better than James Rothschild, the son who
established himself in Paris. In his lifetime James witnessed the defeat of
Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois
monarchy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement
of Napoleon III. French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace
during all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, James
steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his
clan’s inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the
past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the
foundation of the Rothschilds’ power, wealth, and stability.
The best strategy is always to be very strong first in general, then 
at the decisive point.... There is no higher and simpler law of strategy 
than that of keeping one’s forces concentrated.... In short the 
first principle is: act with the utmost concentration.
On War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780-1831
KEYS TO POWER
The world is plagued by greater and greater division—within countries,
political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a state of total
distraction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction
before we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern world’s level of
conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives.
The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more
concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote,
“Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.”
Napoleon knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy’s
weakest spot— it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his
willpower and his mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-
mindedness of purpose, total concentration on the goal, and the use of these
qualities against people less focused, people in a state of distraction—such
an arrow will find its mark every time and overwhelm the enemy.
Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a
single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give himself
over completely to the women he desired that made him so intensely
seductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his
orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacherous
“leads” of the doge’s palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had ever
escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day after
day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all been for
naught, did not discourage him; he persisted and eventually escaped. “I
have always believed,” he later wrote, “that when a man gets it into his head
to do something, and when he exclusively occupies himself in that design,
he must succeed, whatever the difficulties. That man will become Grand
Vizier or Pope.”
Concentrate on a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission. In
the world of power you will constantly need help from other people, usually
those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to another,
believing that he will survive by spreading himself out. It is a corollary of
the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and more
power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source of
power. The scientist Nikola Tesla ruined himself by believing that he
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single
master. He even turned down J. P. Morgan, who offered him a rich contract.
In the end, Tesla’s “independence” meant that he could depend on no single
patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them. Later in his
life he realized his mistake.
All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestled with this problem,
none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino. Throughout
his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to please this prince and
that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles V, promising
the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally discovered the
freedom that came from attachment to a single source of power.
Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius II, Galileo with the
Medicis. In the end, the single patron appreciates your loyalty and becomes
dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the slave.
Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any
organization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often
it is not those with the titles. In the game of power, only the fool flails about
without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations,
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the
beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the early
seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things, it was
the king’s mother. And so he attached himself to her, and catapulted through
the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top.
It is enough to strike oil once—your wealth and power are assured for a
lifetime.
Image: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets 
with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you 
miss the enemy’s heart. Mind and 
arrow must become one. Only 
with such concentration of 
mental and physical 
power can your arrow 
hit the target and 
pierce the 
heart.
 
 
 
Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection resides in quality,
not quantity. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity, and it is the
misfortune of men with wide general interests that while they would like to
have their finger in every pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives
eminence, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Gracián,
1601-1658)
REVERSAL
There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the
proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao
Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts,
using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often
suitable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla
warfare. When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only
makes you an easier target—better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate
your enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.
Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger: If
that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This is what
happened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope
Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and
wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),
Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the
years, and was now without his father’s protection. In cases when you may
need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine yourself around several
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of
great tumult and violent change, or when your enemies are numerous. The
more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them falls
from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off against the
other. Even if you concentrate on the single source of power, you still must
practice caution, and prepare for the day when your master or patron is no
longer there to help you.
Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolerable
bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was so
obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived.
Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything—architecture,
painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of his
power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on the
side of intensity.
