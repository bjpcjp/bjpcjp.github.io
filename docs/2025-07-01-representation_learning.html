          <p>**Representation Learning**  is a process in machine learning where algorithms extract meaningful patterns from raw data to create representations that are easier to understand and process. These representations can be designed for interpretability, reveal hidden features, or be used for transfer learning. They are valuable across many fundamental machine learning tasks like [image classification](/task/image-classification) and [retrieval](/task/image-retrieval).  Deep neural networks can be considered representation learning models that typically encode information which is projected into a different subspace. These representations are then usually passed on to a linear classifier to, for instance, train a classifier.   Representation learning can be divided into:  -  **Supervised representation learning**: learning representations on task A using annotated data and used to solve task B - **Unsupervised representation learning**: learning representations on a task in an unsupervised way (label-free data). These are then used to address downstream tasks and reducing the need for annotated data when learning news tasks. Powerful models like [GPT](/method/gpt) and [BERT](/method/bert) leverage unsupervised representation learning to tackle language tasks.    More recently, [self-supervised learning (SSL)](/task/self-supervised-learning) is one of the main drivers behind unsupervised representation learning in fields like computer vision and NLP.   Here are some additional readings to go deeper on the task:  - [Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives](/paper/representation-learning-a-review-and-new) - Bengio et al.
