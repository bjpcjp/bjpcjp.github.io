          <p>One of the most difficult transitions for leaders to make is the shift from doing to leading . As a new manager you can get away with holding on to work. Peers and bosses may even admire your willingness to keep “rolling up your sleeves” to execute tactical assignments. But as your responsibilities become more complex, the difference between an effective leader and a super-sized individual contributor with a leader’s title is painfully evident. To raise the ceiling of your leadership potential, you need to extend your presence through the actions of others, engaging people so that they contribute their best work to your shared priorities. To set the table for effective delegation, make sure you express why something is important to you, confirm that your expectations for the work have been clearly communicated, ask how much of your involvement they need, and practice saying no. Don’t let a focus on execution hold you back from the big-picture work of leading. If you delegate with these principles in mind, the work will get done, because the right people will be focused on the right tasks.</p>
