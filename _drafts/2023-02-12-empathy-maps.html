		<p>When to Use Empathy Maps: 3 Options</p>
		<p>Many people primarily think of empathy maps as a method for documenting insights from research that has already happened. While that application is useful, empathy maps can also be a powerful tool for planning and shaping future research endeavors.</p>
		<p>You can also use empathy maps for documenting observations during user research. This method works especially well when observers are not researchers. </p>
		<p>Finally, empathy maps can be used post research as an artifact for aggregating and consolidating research findings so that they can be communicated to others. This is, perhaps, the most common use of empathy maps, and for good reason: The simple structure is engaging and easy to navigate for most people.</p>
