  title: Acting
  description: Games with the Acting mechanic require players to use some form of mime or mimicry to communicate with the other players. Charades is probably the poster child for this mechanic, where one member of a team must use non-verbal clues to allow the other members to guess the solution.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2689/action-queue
  title: Action Queue
  description:
    Players create Action Queues and perform them in sequence. Queues can either be "Batch" queues, where all actions are executed in sequence, or "Rolling" queues where actions are added to the end of the Queue, and the first action is then executed. Players may each have their own queue of actions, or there may be a shared action queue.
    Nuclear War is an example of a Rolling queue. Colt Express is an example of a Batch queue. Impulse utilizes a shared rolling queue.
    Some games utilize a fixed action queue printed to the board, such as in Bus and Dominant Species.
    An Action Queue that is only for movement actions is called Programmed Movement, which has a separate entry.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2847/advantage-token
  title: Advantage Token
  description: 
    One player has a token that permits them to do a special Action, or modify an Action. 
    Once used, the token passes to another player.

  title: Area-Impulse
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cN2QgWTTTLVcTGvPsG6Iig__thumb/img/BZHCRQwBcFKABuMTp2yfK8K9pFc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3898887.png
  description: 
    Players subdivide turns into impulses alternating between players which repeat until both players pass 
    (or in some cases a sunset die roll ends the impulses catching one or both players off guard). 
    In those impulses a group of units is once activated or gets to act collectively before being marked spent. 
    However instead of the activated units being grouped by a certain radius from a leader the units activated 
    are in an area (and thus the need for the impulse system to have areas, not hexes). 
    The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse 
    (as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). 
    Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses 
    instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. 
    Finally, before the next turn of impulses, spent units are reset and regain the ability to act.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2931/auction-fixed-placement
  title: Auctions (Dutch)
  description: 
    A simultaneous single-bid system in which the lot starts at a high price and is gradually decreased by the auctioneer or other controlling mechanism, 
    until someone agrees to claim the item at its current price. 
    The first bidder to accept the current price is the winner, such that there are no ties. 
    Also called a one-bid auction because of this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.

  title: Auctions (Sealed Bid)
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wCTcrqmQlad2bAJNY8MIaw__itemrep/img/uJRl6PA9v4JV_g1cHvLVsnMTrAE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic4965730.jpg
  description: 
    Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high bidder wins.
    Typically a tie breaker mechanism is required. 
    Common ones include closest to start player or using a secondary currency for a tie-breaking bid.
    A variation on this is called Sealed Bid with Cancellation. 
    In this case, if two or more players have the same high bid, they are eliminated from contention. 
    The highest non-duplicated bid is the winner. 
    This is best used with Constrained Bidding to make ties more likely.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2838/action-drafting
  title: Action Drafting
  description: 
    Players select from an assortment of Actions in a shared pool. 
    The available Actions are limited in quantity.
    Once a player has chosen an Action it may not be chosen again.
    Worker Placement is a subset of this category. Games with that mechanism should be placed in that category instead.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2839/action-retrieval
  title: Action Retrieval
  description:  
    Each player has a set of Actions available, embodied in cards, tokens, or some other affordance. 
    Once performed, they are spent and may not be performed again until retrieved. 
    Action Retrieval typically is itself an Action, or may take an entire turn.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2916/alliances
  title: Alliances
  description: 
    Players have formal relationships that may change over the course of the game.
    This differs from Negotiation in that these relationships are governed by specific game rules. 
    During that time the players win together, may not attack each other, and grant their ally a special power. 
    Players can bid for the right to select their ally for that round, which is governed by similar rules.
    If players are allied as partners for the entire game, and win or lose together, it is instead a Team-Based Game.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2012/auctionbidding
  title: Auction/Bidding
  description: 
    This mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction in order to enhance your position. 
    These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. 
    The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is found.
    Usually there is a game rule that drops the price if no players are interested. 
    In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. 
    The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. 
    This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2918/auction-english
  title: Auctions (English)
  description:  
    An auctioneer asks for bids of a certain amount and players indicate their willingness to bid at that amount, 
    usually by holding up a hand or paddle, or by calling out. 
    Players are permitted to adjust the increment of the bid, usually by shouting out their actual bid, 
    though this is done infrequently, and usually either to indicate a smaller increment than the auctioneer requests, 
    or a much larger one. 
    When a certain amount of time with no increases occurs, or it is clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, 
    the auctioneer declares that the high bidder is the winner.

  title: Auctions (Turn Order Until Pass)
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JUNRYMWHKMMXtFOmCgNcnQ__imagepage/img/YG4v5kxocA1cvTBVKqzJYYKF5qw=/fit-in/900x600/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/pic4965728.jpg
  description: 
    Starting with one player and going in turn order, players may raise the current bid or pass. 
    When all players but one have passed, the player remaining in the auction is the winner.
    Normally players that pass may not re-enter the auction. However, allowing re-entry is a variation that is not uncommon.

  description:  

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2834/action-timer
  title: Action Timer
  description: 
    Players place owned timers on action spaces and pieces and take an action. 
    When the timer runs out, it may be moved to another location to take that action. 
    Players may move their own timers any time after they have expired.

  description: 
    A Dexterity Auction requires an act of dexterity to submit a valid bid. 
    Typically, this involves a bid marker being placed into a valid bidding area, but other methods for implementing this may be used.
    For example, in Going, Going, GONE!, players place tokens in cups in real time to represent their bid.

  description: 
    A meta-mechanism that modifies a multiple-lot auction by creating rules about which lots players may bid on.
    Bids are shown on a board or cards. It is often combined with constrained-value bids. 
    It ends when every player passes and/or no player has the right to bid further. 
    The highest bidder for each lot wins the lot.
    When all players have placed their token, the bids are resolved.

  description:  
    The automatic increase of a resource triggered by a particular, conditional, deterministic (not random) game state.						

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2840/actionevent
  title: Action/Event
  description:    
    On their turn, the player plays a card that shows Action Points and an Event. 
    They must choose to either use the Action Points or perform the Event. 
    If they choose to use Action Points, typically the Event may be performed by another player.
