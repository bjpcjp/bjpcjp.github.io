  title: Acting
  description: Games with the Acting mechanic require players to use some form of mime or mimicry to communicate with the other players. Charades is probably the poster child for this mechanic, where one member of a team must use non-verbal clues to allow the other members to guess the solution.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2689/action-queue
  title: Action Queue
  description:
    Players create Action Queues and perform them in sequence. Queues can either be "Batch" queues, where all actions are executed in sequence, or "Rolling" queues where actions are added to the end of the Queue, and the first action is then executed. Players may each have their own queue of actions, or there may be a shared action queue.
    Nuclear War is an example of a Rolling queue. Colt Express is an example of a Batch queue. Impulse utilizes a shared rolling queue.
    Some games utilize a fixed action queue printed to the board, such as in Bus and Dominant Species.
    An Action Queue that is only for movement actions is called Programmed Movement, which has a separate entry.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2847/advantage-token
  title: Advantage Token
  description: 
    One player has a token that permits them to do a special Action, or modify an Action. 
    Once used, the token passes to another player.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2021/area-impulse
  title: Area-Impulse
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/cN2QgWTTTLVcTGvPsG6Iig__thumb/img/BZHCRQwBcFKABuMTp2yfK8K9pFc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3898887.png
  description: 
    Players subdivide turns into impulses alternating between players which repeat until both players pass 
    (or in some cases a sunset die roll ends the impulses catching one or both players off guard). 
    In those impulses a group of units is once activated or gets to act collectively before being marked spent. 
    However instead of the activated units being grouped by a certain radius from a leader the units activated 
    are in an area (and thus the need for the impulse system to have areas, not hexes). 
    The areas exist to define scope of activation on an impulse 
    (as well as restrict what can be done on that impulse with respect to attack and movement range). 
    Thus each of a players groups of units each acts once by means of small alternating impulses 
    instead of the traditional all my units then all your units. 
    Finally, before the next turn of impulses, spent units are reset and regain the ability to act.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2931/auction-fixed-placement
  title: Auctions (Dutch)
  description: 
    A simultaneous single-bid system in which the lot starts at a high price and is gradually decreased by the auctioneer or other controlling mechanism, 
    until someone agrees to claim the item at its current price. 
    The first bidder to accept the current price is the winner, such that there are no ties. 
    Also called a one-bid auction because of this feature that the first bid made is also the only bid in the auction.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2920/auction-sealed-bid
  title: Auctions (Sealed Bid)
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wCTcrqmQlad2bAJNY8MIaw__itemrep/img/uJRl6PA9v4JV_g1cHvLVsnMTrAE=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc()/pic4965730.jpg
  description: 
    Players secretly make a bid. All bids are revealed simultaneously, and the high bidder wins.
    Typically a tie breaker mechanism is required. 
    Common ones include closest to start player or using a secondary currency for a tie-breaking bid.
    A variation on this is called Sealed Bid with Cancellation. 
    In this case, if two or more players have the same high bid, they are eliminated from contention. 
    The highest non-duplicated bid is the winner. 
    This is best used with Constrained Bidding to make ties more likely.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2838/action-drafting
  title: Action Drafting
  description: 
    Players select from an assortment of Actions in a shared pool. 
    The available Actions are limited in quantity.
    Once a player has chosen an Action it may not be chosen again.
    Worker Placement is a subset of this category. Games with that mechanism should be placed in that category instead.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2839/action-retrieval
  title: Action Retrieval
  description:  
    Each player has a set of Actions available, embodied in cards, tokens, or some other affordance. 
    Once performed, they are spent and may not be performed again until retrieved. 
    Action Retrieval typically is itself an Action, or may take an entire turn.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2916/alliances
  title: Alliances
  description: 
    Players have formal relationships that may change over the course of the game.
    This differs from Negotiation in that these relationships are governed by specific game rules. 
    During that time the players win together, may not attack each other, and grant their ally a special power. 
    Players can bid for the right to select their ally for that round, which is governed by similar rules.
    If players are allied as partners for the entire game, and win or lose together, it is instead a Team-Based Game.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2012/auctionbidding
  title: Auction/Bidding
  description: 
    This mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction in order to enhance your position. 
    These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. 
    The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is found.
    Usually there is a game rule that drops the price if no players are interested. 
    In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. 
    The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. 
    This is similar to Worker Placement, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2918/auction-english
  title: Auctions (English)
  description:  
    An auctioneer asks for bids of a certain amount and players indicate their willingness to bid at that amount, 
    usually by holding up a hand or paddle, or by calling out. 
    Players are permitted to adjust the increment of the bid, usually by shouting out their actual bid, 
    though this is done infrequently, and usually either to indicate a smaller increment than the auctioneer requests, 
    or a much larger one. 
    When a certain amount of time with no increases occurs, or it is clear that no one wishes to raise the current bid, 
    the auctioneer declares that the high bidder is the winner.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2919/auction-turn-order-until-pass
  title: Auctions (Turn Order Until Pass)
  image: https://cf.geekdo-images.com/JUNRYMWHKMMXtFOmCgNcnQ__imagepage/img/YG4v5kxocA1cvTBVKqzJYYKF5qw=/fit-in/900x600/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/pic4965728.jpg
  description: 
    Starting with one player and going in turn order, players may raise the current bid or pass. 
    When all players but one have passed, the player remaining in the auction is the winner.
    Normally players that pass may not re-enter the auction. However, allowing re-entry is a variation that is not uncommon.

  title: Action Points
  description:  

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2834/action-timer
  title: Action Timer
  description: 
    Players place owned timers on action spaces and pieces and take an action. 
    When the timer runs out, it may be moved to another location to take that action. 
    Players may move their own timers any time after they have expired.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2080/area-majority-influence
  title: Area Majority / Influence
  description:
    Multiple players may occupy a space and gain benefits based on their proportional presence in the space.

  description: 
    A Dexterity Auction requires an act of dexterity to submit a valid bid. 
    Typically, this involves a bid marker being placed into a valid bidding area, but other methods for implementing this may be used.
    For example, in Going, Going, GONE!, players place tokens in cups in real time to represent their bid.

  description: 
    A meta-mechanism that modifies a multiple-lot auction by creating rules about which lots players may bid on.
    Bids are shown on a board or cards. It is often combined with constrained-value bids. 
    It ends when every player passes and/or no player has the right to bid further. 
    The highest bidder for each lot wins the lot.
    When all players have placed their token, the bids are resolved.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2903/automatic-resource-growth
  title: Automatic Resource Growth
  description:  
    The automatic increase of a resource triggered by a particular, conditional, deterministic (not random) game state.						

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2840/actionevent
  title: Action/Event
  description:    
    On their turn, the player plays a card that shows Action Points and an Event. 
    They must choose to either use the Action Points or perform the Event. 
    If they choose to use Action Points, typically the Event may be performed by another player.

- href: https://www.boardgamefinds.com/mechanic/bettingandbluffing
  title: Betting and Bluffing
  description: 
    Players are given the opportunity to place bets on certain outcomes. 
    These bets can range from predicting the winner of a race to guessing the outcome of a dice roll. 
    The amount of risk is usually determined by the player, allowing for a variety of strategies to be employed.
    Bluffing involves deceiving opponents by making false claims or hiding information. 
    Players may bluff about the strength of their hand, their intentions, or their knowledge of the game's mechanics. 
    Bluffing can be a powerful tool to manipulate opponents and gain an advantage, but it also carries the risk of being exposed and losing credibility.
    Both betting and bluffing mechanics rely heavily on player interaction and observation. 
    Reading opponents' behavior and making calculated decisions based on limited information are key skills in games that utilize this mechanic.

- href: https://www.boardgamefinds.com/mechanic/bias
  title: Bias
  description:  	
    Bias can manifest in various ways within a game.
    It can be implemented through randomized events, variable player powers, or asymmetric player roles. 
    They can affect resource allocation, movement options, or even victory conditions. 
    The presence of bias creates a dynamic and ever-changing game environment, challenging players to think on their feet and adjust their plans accordingly.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2999/bingo
  title: Bingo
  description: 
    Items are selected at random, and each player needs to use the items for their own player boards. 						

- href: https://www.boardgamefinds.com/mechanic/bribery
  title: Bribery
  description:
    Players are presented with situations where they can gain an advantage by persuading or bribing other players. 
    This can be done through the exchange of resources, promises of future assistance, or even leveraging personal relationships within the game's narrative.
    Bribery can impact gameplay in various ways. 
    It can create alliances and rivalries among players, as they seek to gain the upper hand by forming temporary partnerships 
    or by exploiting the weaknesses of others. 
    It also introduces a level of uncertainty, as players must navigate the delicate balance between offering enticing bribes 
    and avoiding potential backlash from their opponents.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2018/campaign-battle-card-driven
  title: Campaign / Battle Card Driven
  description: 
    A relatively recent development in wargames that focuses the players' actions on cards they have in their hand. 
    Performing a single action uses a single card; cards will often be multi-purpose.
    Action/Event is a similar but more distinctive mechanic. 
    Games where the cards are used to deploy specific units are considered to be using Command Cards. 
    Games where cards are used to affect the outcome of battles are considered to be using Card Play Conflict Resolution.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2956/chaining
  title: Chaining
  description:  
    Pieces are stationary but are built out in chains. This can give a dynamic sense of motion to the game, even though the pieces do not move.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2013/commodity-speculation
  title: Commodity Speculation
  description: 
    A subcategory of Investment. Players buy and sell commodities as they change value throughout the game.
    Commodity Speculation includes both Investment games in which players have some indirect control over asset values, 
    but have a hard time hurting others without hurting themselves; and Collusion games, 
    in which players have huge direct control in manipulating asset values, forcing players to help others and manage shifting alliances.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2912/contracts
  title: Contracts
  description:  
    Players fulfill Contracts to earn rewards. 
    They take the form of special goals requiring coordination and planning beyond simply being "first past the post". 
    They can be public, where all players compete to be the first to complete them, or private, where only the owning player may fulfill them.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2854/critical-hits-and-failures
  title: Critical Hits and Failures
  description:  	
    Dice are rolled. Those exceeding a target number generate a success. 
    Certain rolls (typically the highest and/or lowest on the die) generate additional success or extreme failure.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2041/card-drafting
  title: Card Drafting
  description: 
    Players pick cards from a limited subset, such as a common pool, to gain an advantage or to assemble hands of cards to meet objectives within the game. 


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2041/card-drafting
  title: Chit-Pull System
  description: 
    Used in wargames to simulate simultaneous action on the battlefield. 
    In such a system the current player randomly draws a chit or counter identifying a group of units which may now be moved. 
    Schemes include moving any units commanded by a particular leader, 
    moving units of a particular quality or activating units not for movement but for fighting.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2041/card-drafting
  title: Communication Limits
  description: 
    Players are given roles or objectives that they must fulfill. However, they are not allowed to freely discuss their actions or plans with other players. 
    Instead, they must rely on limited forms of communication, such as non-verbal cues, gestures, or predetermined signals, 
    to convey their intentions or coordinate their moves.
    This introduces a level of uncertainty and tension as players must interpret their teammates' actions 
    and make decisions based on incomplete information. 
    It requires players to carefully observe and analyze the game state, as well as anticipate their teammates' needs and intentions.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2990/cube-tower
  title: Cube Tower
  description:
    Actions are resolved by dropping cubes of various colors into a tower and seeing which emerge at the bottom.
    Cubes that do not emerge may come out in future actions. This is a form of a shared Deck, Bag, and Pool Building as implemented by a Drop Tower.

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2857/card-play-conflict-resolution
  title: Card Play Conflict Resolution
  description: 
    Each player simultaneously or sequentially plays one or more cards. 
    These modify the base outcome of a conflict and allow various special abilities to apply.
    This can function similarly to Area Majority / Influence, but with a discrete resolution or award of the conflict target, 
    rather than by dynamic/shifting control of a fixed asset. 
    It is similar to Force Commitment, but that mechanic presupposes a more liquid resource where the quantity can be chosen.


- href: http://Closed Economy Auction | Board Game Mechanic
  title: Auction (Closed Economy) 
  description: 
    This involves players bidding on items or resources using a limited pool of currency within the game. 
    Unlike open economy auctions where players can introduce external currency, closed economy auctions restrict bidding 
    to the resources provided within the game.

  title: Cooperative Game
  description: 

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2887/catch-leader
  title: Catch the Leader
  description: 
    Players are motivated to monitor the progress of their opponents and make strategic decisions accordingly. 
    The mechanic incorporates elements such as variable turn order, resource management, or player interaction to create opportunities 
    for players to catch up or maintain their lead.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2841/command-cards
  title: Command Cards
  description: 
    Players typically start with a hand of these cards, which they can use throughout the game to influence the outcome. 
    Each card usually has a specific effect or ability that can be used to manipulate the game state, 
    such as moving units, attacking enemies, or activating special abilities.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2922/constrained-bidding
  title: Constrained Bidding
  description:  
    Players are given a limited number of tokens or resources. They represent currency, influence, or other valuable assets. 
    Players must allocate their tokens to bid on various actions, resources, or opportunities presented during the game.


- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2010/crayon-rail-system
  title: Crayon Rail System
  description: 	
    The Crayon Rail System is a subcategory of Route/Network Building. 
    Types of these games use crayon or other non-permanent methods of making connecting lines on a board, often eraseable. 
    This appears to be a mechanism used mostly in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, and not quite as popular today. 

- href: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/3004/deck-construction
  title: Deck Construction
  description: 
    Most people are familiar with games that use decks of cards. 
    A deck building game builds upon this idea, but instead of having 108 shared cards (Uno), 
    you have your own deck. And when you start the game everyone’s decks are the same. 
    But as the game goes on, you purchase cards from a pool "face up" cards.

  description: 
    Players play cards out of individual decks, seeking to acquire new cards and to play through their decks iteratively, 
    improving them over time through card acquisition or card elimination.
    It may include a "random-draw" to form a hand from the deck for the current round.
    The deck can be reset once the draw pile is exhausted, or it may allow access to all available cards at once until the discards are retrieved.

  title: Delayed Purchase
  description: 
    Delayed Purchase introduces a twist to the traditional purchasing aspect of gameplay. 
    Unlike the typical approach where players can immediately acquire items or resources, 
    Delayed Purchase requires players to plan ahead and strategically decide when to make their purchases.

  title: Enclosure
  description:
    Players place or move pieces in order to surround areas contiguously with their pieces. 
    The oldest and most famous Area Enclosure game is of course Go, but many newer examples also exist.
    Area Enclosure is different than Area Majority / Influence because players actually create the areas on a gridded board during the course of play, 
    whereas in Area Majority/Influence the actual areas are pre-existing and players are merely competing control over them.

    The results of the vote can have a wide range of effects
    such as determining the next course of action, allocating resources, or even eliminating players from the game.
