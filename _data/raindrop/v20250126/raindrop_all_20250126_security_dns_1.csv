876769562,Certificates for localhost,,"Sometimes people want to get a certificate for the hostname &ldquo;localhost&rdquo;, either for use in local development, or for distribution with a native application that needs to communicate with a web application. Let&rsquo;s Encrypt can&rsquo;t provide certificates for &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; because nobody uniquely owns it, and it&rsquo;s not rooted in a top level domain like &ldquo;.com&rdquo; or &ldquo;.net&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s possible to set up your own domain name that happens to resolve to 127.",https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost,my_library,"devops, dns, security",2018-07-15T13:46:24.000Z,https://letsencrypt.org/images/LetsEncrypt-SocialShare.png,,False
