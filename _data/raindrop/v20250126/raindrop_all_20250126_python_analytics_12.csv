876777293,Pylift: A Fast Python Package for Uplift Modeling – Wayfair,,"Uplift models seek to predict the incremental value attained in response to a treatment. For example, if we want to know the value of showing an advertisement to someone, typical response models will only tell us that a person is likely to purchase after being given an advertisement, though they may have been likely to purchase already. Uplift models will predict how much more likely they are to purchase after being shown the ad. The most scalable uplift modeling packages to date are theoretically rigorous, but, in practice, they can be prohibitively slow. We have written a Python package, pylift, that implements a transformative method wrapped around scikit-learn to allow for (1) quick implementation of uplift, (2) rigorous uplift evaluation, and (3) an extensible python-based framework for future uplift method implementations.",https://tech.wayfair.com/data-science/2018/10/pylift-a-fast-python-package-for-uplift-modeling,my_library,"analytics, python",2021-01-02T22:01:56.000Z,https://cdn.aboutwayfair.com/dims4/default/72a4236/2147483647/strip/true/crop/890x467+0+84/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.aboutwayfair.com%2F26%2F56%2F6a48e6a44998b90781ff0d395840%2Fc751a432-pylift-feature-image.png,,False
