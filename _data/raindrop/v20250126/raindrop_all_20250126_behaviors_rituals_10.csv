876787802,The Hidden Power of Workplace Rituals,,"Employees rightly expect to be able to bring their feelings — big and small — to work. One important way to provide that support is through rituals.

The author presents a case study from a company that took a risk in real time and created a successful response to a tragedy, and over time, that response became a ritual. Here’s how they did it, and how leaders can better understand their own rituals — both current ones and those that have yet to be discovered.",https://hbr.org/2022/08/the-hidden-power-of-workplace-rituals,my_library,"behaviors, rituals",2022-08-19T11:23:58.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/08/Aug22_17_78621556.jpg,,False
