876789804,Adaptive Sampling,,"D3’s projections use adaptive sampling to increase the accuracy of projected lines and polygons while still performing efficiently. Without sampling, only the input vertices of polygons are projected. This results in the artifacts (visible above) due to projected lines becoming curves. Uniform sampling improves the appearance by adding interstitial samples between input vertices. It is inefficient because most samples are not needed, and even areas of extreme distortion still exhibit artifacts!
