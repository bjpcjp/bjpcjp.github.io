876774854,Handling imbalanced dataset in supervised learning using family of SMOTE algorithm. - DataScienceCentral.com,,Consider a problem where you are working on a machine learning classification problem. You get an accuracy of 98% and you are very happy. But that happiness doesn’t last long when you look at the confusion matrix and realize that majority class is 98% of the total data and all examples are classified as majority… Read More »Handling imbalanced dataset in supervised learning using family of SMOTE algorithm.,https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/handling-imbalanced-data-sets-in-supervised-learning-using-family?fbclid=IwAR0YEyUV5DLG_dklaaHyz-6LZK3rO-ZvVcqPj6wZntHJ-TfHpfmp1Mcm1zY,my_library,"machine-learning, unbalanced",2020-05-15T11:27:08.000Z,https://www.datasciencecentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2808331754.png,,False
