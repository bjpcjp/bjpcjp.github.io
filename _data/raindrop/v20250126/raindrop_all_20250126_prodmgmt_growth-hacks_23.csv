876769626,Why Adding More Products Isn’t Always the Best Way to Grow,,"Product expansion is often used as a path to growth, but it can have unintended consequences for other aspects of the business — including the customer experience central to the company’s value proposition. Indeed, current trends are moving away from broad offerings in many industries. A recent poll had 64% of consumers saying they would pay more for a simpler, more convenient experience. The trick is, growth strategies have to fit the company’s current context, especially its brand promise and its target market. Once the company has a strategy to fit the context, it can sequence out the various steps to implement it. For example, McDonald’s had known for years that customers wanted all-day breakfast, but to be able to offer it, it first had to streamline and revamp its kitchens.",https://hbr.org/2018/08/why-adding-more-products-isnt-always-the-best-way-to-grow,my_library,"growth-hacks, prodmgmt",2018-08-28T18:49:03.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_28_82401081.jpg,,False
