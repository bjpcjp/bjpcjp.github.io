876772714,Counting FLOPS and other CPU counters in Python,,On the Linux command line it is fairly easy to use the perf command to measure number of floating point operations (or other performance metrics). (See for example this old blog post ) with this approach it is not easy to get a fine grained view of how different stages of processings within a single process. In this short note I describe how the python-papi package can be used to measure the FLOP requirements of any section of a Python program.,http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/python/flops/2019/09/27/python-counting-events.html,my_library,"cpus, python",2019-11-24T17:28:31.000Z,,,False
