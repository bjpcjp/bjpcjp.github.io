876787341,Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?,,"We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership–as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders–the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities. The first quality of exceptional leaders is that they selectively reveal their weaknesses (weaknesses, not fatal flaws). Doing so lets employees see that they are approachable. It builds an atmosphere of trust and helps galvanize commitment. The second quality of inspirational leaders is their heavy reliance on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions. Such leaders are good “situation sensors”–they can sense what’s going on without having things spelled out for them. Managing employees with “tough empathy” is the third quality of exceptional leadership. Tough empathy means giving people what they need, not what they want. Leaders must empathize passionately and realistically with employees, care intensely about the work they do, and be straightforward with them. The fourth quality of top-notch leaders is that they capitalize on their differences. They use what’s unique about themselves to create a social distance and to signal separateness, which in turn motivates employees to perform better. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, “Be yourself–more–with skill.”",https://hbr.org/2000/09/why-should-anyone-be-led-by-you,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion, leadership",2022-07-18T15:22:24.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2000/09/SEPT15_03_article_Goffee_t.jpg,,False

876786734,Persuasion Triggers In Web Design — Smashing Magazine,,"How do you make decisions? If you're like most people, you'll probably answer that you pride yourself on weighing the pros and cons of a situation carefully and then make a decision based on logic. You know that other people have weak personalities and are easily swayed by their emotions, but this rarely happens to you. You've just experienced the [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) — the tendency to believe that other people's behaviour is due to their personality (“Josh is late because he's a disorganised person”) whereas our behaviour is due to external circumstances (“I'm late because the directions were useless”). Cognitive biases like these play a significant role in the way we make decisions so it's not surprising that people are now examining these biases **to see how to exploit them in the design of web sites**. I'm going to use the term ‘persuasion architects' to describe designers who knowingly use these techniques to influence the behaviour of users. (Many skilled designers already use some of these psychological techniques intuitively — but they wouldn't be able to articulate why they have made a particular design choice. The difference between these designers and persuasion architects is that persuasion architects use these techniques intentionally).",https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/persuasion-triggers-in-web-design,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion",2022-07-18T15:19:11.000Z,https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/513d630b-5619-4e47-9277-eef2e4f1161a/triggers.jpg,,False
