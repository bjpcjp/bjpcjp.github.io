948847299,Microsoft Presents a Comprehensive Framework for Securing Generative AI Systems Using Lessons from Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products,,"The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative AI systems across various domains have increased the critical importance of AI red teaming for evaluating technology safety and security. While AI red teaming aims to evaluate end-to-end systems by simulating real-world attacks, current methodologies face significant challenges in effectiveness and implementation. The complexity of modern AI systems, with their expanding capabilities across multiple modalities including vision and audio, has created an unprecedented array of potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Moreover, integrating agentic systems that grant AI models higher privileges and access to external tools has substantially increased the attack surface and",https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/01/18/microsoft-presents-a-comprehensive-framework-for-securing-generative-ai-systems-using-lessons-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products/,my_library,"llms, malware",2025-01-18T18:17:15.653Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-18-at-10.12.05%E2%80%AFAM.png,,False
