876772799,The 5 Algorithms for Efficient Deep Learning Inference on Small Devices - Fritz ai,,"With recent developments in deep learning, neural networks are getting larger and larger. For example, in the ImageNet recognition challenge, the winning model, from 2012 to 2015, increased in size by 16 times. And in just one year, for Baidu’s… Continue reading The 5 Algorithms for Efficient Deep Learning Inference on Small Devices",https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-5-algorithms-for-efficient-deep-learning-inference-on-small-devices-bcc2d18aa806,my_library,"deep-learning, mobile",2019-12-14T20:31:12.000Z,https://fritz.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1XcBZJ1JuAi9qfnIy-IpEgg.jpeg,,False
876772715,Powerful computer vision algorithms are now small enough to run on your phone,,"Researchers have shrunk state-of-the-art computer vision models to run on low-power devices. Growing pains: Visual recognition is deep learning’s strongest skill. Computer vision algorithms are analyzing medical images, enabling self-driving cars, and powering face recognition. But training models to recognize actions in videos has grown increasingly expensive. This has fueled concerns about the technology’s carbon…",https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614551/ai-computer-vision-algorithms-on-your-phone-mit-ibm,my_library,"deep-learning, mobile, vision",2019-11-24T17:30:00.000Z,"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tinymachinevision-01-01-13.png?resize=1200,600",,False
