876776105,A Gentle Introduction to Information Entropy - MachineLearningMastery.com,,"Information theory is a subfield of mathematics concerned with transmitting data across a noisy channel. A cornerstone of information theory is the idea of quantifying how much information there is in a message. More generally, this can be used to quantify the information in an event and a random variable, called entropy, and is calculated using probability. Calculating information and…",https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-information-entropy,my_library,"info-theory, machine-learning",2020-11-03T00:08:25.000Z,https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Plot-of-Probability-Distribution-vs-Entropy.png,,False
