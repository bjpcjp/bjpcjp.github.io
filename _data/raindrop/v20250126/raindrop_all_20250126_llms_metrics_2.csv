910543878,Four Cutting-Edge Methods for Evaluating AI Agents and Enhancing LLM Performance,,"The advent of LLMs has propelled advancements in AI for decades. One such advanced application of LLMs is Agents, which replicate human reasoning remarkably. An agent is a system that can perform complicated tasks by following a reasoning process similar to humans: think (solution to the problem), collect (context from past information), analyze(the situations and data), and adapt (based on the style and feedback). Agents encourage the system through dynamic and intelligent activities, including planning, data analysis, data retrieval, and utilizing the model's past experiences.Â  A typical agent has four components: Brain: An LLM with advanced processing capabilities, such as",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/11/28/four-cutting-edge-methods-for-evaluating-ai-agents-and-enhancing-llm-performance/,my_library,"llms, metrics",2024-11-28T12:00:39.686Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ai-6767497_1280.jpg,,False
