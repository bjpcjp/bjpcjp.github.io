876785156,Failure mode and effects analysis,,"Failure mode and effects analysis is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis, but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical failure rate models are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database. It was one of the first highly structured, systematic techniques for failure analysis. It was developed by reliability engineers in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis,my_library,"execution, failure, quality",2022-06-28T19:27:45.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/FMEA.png,,False
