But universal building blocks of value do exist, creating opportunities for companies to improve their performance in existing markets or break into new markets. In the right combinations, the authors’ analysis shows, those elements will pay off in stronger customer loyalty, greater consumer willingness to try a particular brand, and sustained revenue growth. Three decades of experience doing consumer research and observation for corporate clients led the authors—all with Bain & Company—to identify 30 “elements of value.” Their model traces its conceptual roots to Abraham Maslow’s “hierarchy of needs” and extends his insights by focusing on people as consumers: describing their behavior around products and services. They arrange the elements in a pyramid according to four kinds of needs, with “functional” at the bottom, followed by “emotional,” “life changing,” and then “social impact” at the peak. The authors provide real-world examples to demonstrate how companies have used the elements to grow revenue, refine product design to better meet customers’ needs, identify where customers perceive strengths and weaknesses, and cross-sell services.",https://hbr.org/2016/09/the-elements-of-value,my_library,"pricing, prodmgmt",2022-07-18T15:14:32.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/07/R1609C_CAM.jpg,,False

876780045,There’s Still Profit Potential in Your Low-Profit Customers,,"Profit desert customers — small, low-profit customers often numbering in the tens of thousands — are an important business segment in most companies. They often amount to about 50–80% of customers and consume about 40–60% of the company’s costs. In some companies, they’re assigned to territory reps as low-revenue “C” accounts, which distracts the reps from selling more lucrative business. In all companies, they create costly complexity in functions ranging from order-taking to fulfilment to after-sales service and returns because these customers are numerous and often inexperienced. The best way to manage your profit desert customers is to cluster them under a unified management structure — a profit desert customer team — rather than having them scattered in sales reps’ portfolios throughout the company. This team should be composed of specialized sales and marketing managers who are solely focused on this customer segment.
