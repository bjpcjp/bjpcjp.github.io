925962810,Slim-Llama: An Energy-Efficient LLM ASIC Processor Supporting 3-Billion Parameters at Just 4.69mW,,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of artificial intelligence, driving advancements in natural language processing and decision-making tasks. However, their extensive power demands, resulting from high computational overhead and frequent external memory access, significantly hinder their scalability and deployment, especially in energy-constrained environments such as edge devices. This escalates the cost of operation while also limiting accessibility to these LLMs, which therefore calls for energy-efficient approaches designed to handle billion-parameter models. Current approaches to reduce the computational and memory needs of LLMs are based either on general-purpose processors or on GPUs, with a combination of weight quantization and",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/12/20/slim-llama-an-energy-efficient-llm-asic-processor-supporting-3-billion-parameters-at-just-4-69mw/,my_library,"llms, semiconductors, chip-design",2024-12-21T00:43:25.274Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-4.36.50%E2%80%AFPM.png,,False
