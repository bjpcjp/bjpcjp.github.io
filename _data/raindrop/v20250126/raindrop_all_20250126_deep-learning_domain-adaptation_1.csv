876777122,Computer Vision | Papers With Code,,**Domain Adaptation** is the task of adapting models across domains. This is motivated by the challenge where the test and training datasets fall from different data distributions due to some factor. Domain adaptation aims to build machine learning models that can be generalized into a target domain and dealing with the discrepancy across domain distributions.
