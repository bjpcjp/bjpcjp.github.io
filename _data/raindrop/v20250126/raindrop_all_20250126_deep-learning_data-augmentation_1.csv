876777123,Computer Vision | Papers With Code,,"Data augmentation involves techniques used for increasing the amount of data, based on different modifications, to expand the amount of examples in the original dataset. Data augmentation not only helps to grow the dataset but it also increases the diversity of the dataset. When training machine learning models, data augmentation acts as a regularizer and helps to avoid overfitting.   Data augmentation techniques have been found useful in domains like NLP and computer vision. In computer vision, transformations like cropping, flipping, and rotation are used. In NLP, data augmentation techniques can include swapping, deletion, random insertion, among others.
