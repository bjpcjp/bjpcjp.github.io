876778962,Singular value decomposition - Wikipedia,,"In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix into a rotation, followed by a rescaling followed by another rotation. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any ⁠⁠ matrix. It is related to the polar decomposition.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition,my_library,"machine-learning, svd",2021-05-07T16:12:28.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Singular-Value-Decomposition.svg/1200px-Singular-Value-Decomposition.svg.png,,False
