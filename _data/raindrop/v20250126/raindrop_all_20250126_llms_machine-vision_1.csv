876797033,Demystifying Vision-Language Models: An In-Depth Exploration,,"Vision-language models (VLMs), capable of processing both images and text, have gained immense popularity due to their versatility in solving a wide range of tasks, from information retrieval in scanned documents to code generation from screenshots. However, the development of these powerful models has been hindered by a lack of understanding regarding the critical design choices that truly impact their performance. This knowledge gap makes it challenging for researchers to make meaningful progress in this field. To address this issue, a team of researchers from Hugging Face and Sorbonne Universit√© conducted extensive experiments to unravel the factors that matter the",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/05/23/demystifying-vision-language-models-an-in-depth-exploration,my_library,"llms, machine-vision",2024-05-24T06:11:12.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-16-at-12.00.13-AM.png,,False
