876782359,Divine Comedy - Wikipedia,,"The Divine Comedy is an Italian narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, begun c. 1308 and completed around 1321, shortly before the author's death. It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century.

It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy,my_library,"books, goodreads, history, storytelling",2022-01-23T19:20:57.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Dante_Domenico_di_Michelino.jpg/1200px-Dante_Domenico_di_Michelino.jpg,,False
