Dropped new timelapse! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JBMpzW_B58

Hi all, i built a 24K resolution 360 camera specifically for upcoming 360 timelapse project. Check it out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fseH9Kd5ooM

If you'd like to support my camera work so I can continue timelapse (this piece used up more than half of my D750 Shutter Life. Rain and camera also don't get along) please check out my patreon:

30 Days of Timelapse, about 80,000 photos combined. 1500GB of Project files. Sailing in the open ocean is a unique feeling and experience.I hope to capture and share it for everyone to see.
