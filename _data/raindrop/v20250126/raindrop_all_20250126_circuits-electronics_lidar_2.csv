Highlight:Wavelength

Highlight:Photodetectors

Highlight:Ranging

Highlight:Mechanical

Highlight:Solid-state

Highlight:infrared laser light

Highlight:particular superpower is that it can generate high resolution

Highlight:compared to radar (microwaves)

Highlight:infrared

Highlight:visible range (380 to 700 nanometers

Highlight:power

Highlight:sensitivity

Highlight:interference

Highlight:Sunlight

Highlight:absorption by water vapor

Highlight:easily absorbed by the retina

Highlight:engineered PN semiconductor junctions that utilize the photoelectric effect to generate electron-hole pairs in response to incident photons. They generate a current proportional to the number of photos incident,

Highlight:SPADs generate a near binary response

Highlight:single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)

Highlight:With this, the timing of photon arrivals can be determined to pico-second (trillionth of a second) accuracies

Highlight:silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) have largely replaced Si APDs.

Highlight:Hence the minimum depth of such radars are usually limited to a few centimeters

Highlight:Commercial dToF systems have a maximum range of 100-200 meters.

Highlight:continuous wave signals

Highlight:This “beat” frequency can be downconverted using a mixer and used to compute both distance and velocity of the object.

Highlight:Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), and Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs)

Highlight:need for a frequency tunable laser source

Highlight:brushless DC motor

Highlight:Waymo’s Laser Bear Honeycomb,

Highlight:A trade-off in MEMS mirror design is weight versus scanning rate; a heavy mirror will have low scanning rate.

Highlight:MEMS mirrors can be fabricated using back-end-of-line processes in a legacy CMOS

Highlight:Flash lidar consists of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) as laser sourc",False
