876777129,Computer Vision | Papers With Code,,"**Depth Estimation** is the task of measuring the distance of each pixel relative to the camera. Depth is extracted from either monocular (single) or stereo (multiple views of a scene) images. Traditional methods use multi-view geometry to find the relationship between the images. Newer methods can directly estimate depth by minimizing the regression loss, or by learning to generate a novel view from a sequence. The most popular benchmarks are KITTI and NYUv2. Models are typically evaluated according to a RMS metric.
