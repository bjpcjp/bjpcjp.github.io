876777119,Browse the State-of-the-Art in Machine Learning | Papers With Code,,"**Image Classification** is a fundamental task in vision recognition that aims to understand and categorize an image as a whole under a specific label. Unlike [object detection](/task/object-detection), which involves classification and location of multiple objects within an image, image classification typically pertains to single-object images. When the classification becomes highly detailed or reaches instance-level, it is often referred to as [image retrieval](/task/image-retrieval), which also involves finding similar images in a large database.
