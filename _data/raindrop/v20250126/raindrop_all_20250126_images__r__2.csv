876769073,Image Convolution in R using Magick,,"Release 1.4 of the magick package introduces a new feature called image convolution that was requested by Thomas L. Pedersen. In this post we explain what this is all about. Kernel Matrix The new image_convolve() function applies a kernel over the image. Kernel convolution means that each pixel value is recalculated using the weighted neighborhood sum defined in the kernel matrix. For example lets look at this simple kernel: library(magick) kern % image_negate() As with the blurring, the original image can be blended in with the transformed one, effectively sharpening the image along edges. img %>% image_convolve('DoG:0,0,2', scaling = '100, 100%') The ImageMagick documentation has more examples of convolve with various avaiable kernels.",https://www.r-bloggers.com/image-convolution-in-r-using-magick,my_library,"images, _r_",2017-12-27T18:05:59.000Z,https://i.imgur.com/Y6xByUL.gif,,False
