913861899,98 Hardware Security Failure Scenarios (NIST),,"A new technical paper titled “Hardware Security Failure Scenarios: Potential Hardware Weaknesses” was published by NIST. Abstract “Hardware is often assumed to be robust from a security perspective. However, chips are both created with software and contain complex encodings (e.g., circuit designs and firmware). This leads to bugs, some of which compromise security.
