876787341,Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?,,"We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership–as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders–the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities. The first quality of exceptional leaders is that they selectively reveal their weaknesses (weaknesses, not fatal flaws). Doing so lets employees see that they are approachable. It builds an atmosphere of trust and helps galvanize commitment. The second quality of inspirational leaders is their heavy reliance on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions. Such leaders are good “situation sensors”–they can sense what’s going on without having things spelled out for them. Managing employees with “tough empathy” is the third quality of exceptional leadership. Tough empathy means giving people what they need, not what they want. Leaders must empathize passionately and realistically with employees, care intensely about the work they do, and be straightforward with them. The fourth quality of top-notch leaders is that they capitalize on their differences. They use what’s unique about themselves to create a social distance and to signal separateness, which in turn motivates employees to perform better. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, “Be yourself–more–with skill.”",https://hbr.org/2000/09/why-should-anyone-be-led-by-you,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion, leadership",2022-07-18T15:22:24.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2000/09/SEPT15_03_article_Goffee_t.jpg,,False

876785044,An Exercise to Help Your Team Feel More Comfortable with Conflict,,"The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.",https://hbr.org/2019/03/an-exercise-to-help-your-team-feel-more-comfortable-with-conflict,my_library,"behaviors, leadership, prodmgmt, teamwork",2022-06-25T13:31:57.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/03/Mar19_14_667758797.jpg,,False

For example, consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not “sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.",https://hbr.org/2021/04/find-the-right-words-to-inspire-your-team,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion, leadership, motivation, speaking",2021-04-18T22:50:02.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2021/04/Apr21_13_HBRquotations.jpg,,False

Researchers recently explored this in a set of studies.

Instead of speaking up, what they observed among their participants was something like the bystander effect, a psychological phenomena describing how people stay on the sidelines as passive bystanders, waiting for others to act rather than do something themselves.
