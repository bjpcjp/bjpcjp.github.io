876775012,Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for Feature Selection in Python,,"Recursive Feature Elimination, or RFE for short, is a popular feature selection algorithm. RFE is popular because it is easy to configure and use and because it is effective at selecting those features (columns) in a training dataset that are more or most relevant in predicting the target variable. There are two important configuration options when using RFE: the choiceâ€¦",https://machinelearningmastery.com/rfe-feature-selection-in-python,my_library,"feature-engineering, machine-learning, python",2020-06-01T16:43:31.000Z,https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Box-Plot-of-RFE-Number-of-Selected-Features-vs-Classification-Accuracy.png,,False
