However, their extensive power demands, resulting from high computational overhead and frequent external memory access, significantly hinder their scalability and deployment, especially in energy-constrained environments such as edge devices. This escalates the cost of operation while also limiting accessibility to these LLMs, which therefore calls for energy-efficient approaches designed to handle billion-parameter models. Current approaches to reduce the computational and memory needs of LLMs are based either on general-purpose processors or on GPUs, with a combination of weight quantization and",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/12/20/slim-llama-an-energy-efficient-llm-asic-processor-supporting-3-billion-parameters-at-just-4-69mw/,my_library,"llms, semiconductors, chip-design",2024-12-21T00:43:25.274Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-20-at-4.36.50%E2%80%AFPM.png,,False

Thermal characterization shows that for a 165K change in temperature, the Sub-threshold Slope (SS) and threshold voltage vary by 69 % and ~70 mV, respectively. At room temperature, a single gate contacted n-FinFET RF device exhibits a cutoff and maximum oscillation frequency of ~100 GHz and ~170 GHz, respectively. Analog and RF Figures of Merit (FoMs) for 5 nm technology at a device level and their temperature sensitivity are also reported. The industry standard BSIM-CMG model is modified to capture the impact of self-heating (SH) and parasitics. The SH model is based on measured data, and the modeling approach renders it independent of other model parameters. To the authors’ knowledge, an iteration free approach to develop a model-card for RF applications is explained for the very first time. Excellent agreement between the measured data and the model indicates that our methodology is accurate and can be used for faster PDK development.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10192908,my_library,"chip-design, semiconductors",2023-10-07T21:45:44.000Z,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/ieee_logo_smedia_200X200.png,,False
