876785044,An Exercise to Help Your Team Feel More Comfortable with Conflict,,"The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.",https://hbr.org/2019/03/an-exercise-to-help-your-team-feel-more-comfortable-with-conflict,my_library,"behaviors, leadership, prodmgmt, teamwork",2022-06-25T13:31:57.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/03/Mar19_14_667758797.jpg,,False
