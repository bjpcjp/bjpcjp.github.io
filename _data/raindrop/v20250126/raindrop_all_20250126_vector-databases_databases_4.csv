This AI Paper Offers Operati,,"A significant challenge in information retrieval today is determining the most efficient method for nearest-neighbor vector search, especially with the growing complexity of dense and sparse retrieval models. Practitioners must navigate a wide range of options for indexing and retrieval methods, including HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small-World) graphs, flat indexes, and inverted indexes. These methods offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, scalability, and quality of retrieval results. As datasets become larger and more complex, the absence of clear operational guidance makes it difficult for practitioners to optimize their systems, particularly for applications requiring high performance, such as search engines and",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/15/hnsw-flat-or-inverted-index-which-should-you-choose-for-your-search-this-ai-paper-offers-operational-advice-for-dense-and-sparse-retrievers,my_library,vector-databases,2016-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-15-at-5.59.01-PM.png,,False
