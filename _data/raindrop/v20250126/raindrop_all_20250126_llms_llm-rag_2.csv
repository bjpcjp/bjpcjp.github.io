881001333,Top 9 Different Types of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs),,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a machine learning framework that combines the advantages of both retrieval-based and generation-based models. The RAG framework is highly regarded for its ability to handle large amounts of information and produce coherent, contextually accurate responses. It leverages external data sources by retrieving relevant documents or facts and then generating an answer or output based on the retrieved information and the user query. This blend of retrieval and generation leads to better-informed outputs that are more accurate and comprehensive than models that rely solely on generation. The evolution of RAG has led to various types and approaches,",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/14/top-9-different-types-of-retrieval-augmented-generation-rags,my_library,"llms, llm-rag",2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P0z9zxKgRaSehlAFs0QzfQ.jpg,,False
