876793807,‘Let’s Go Shopping (LGS)’ Dataset: A Large-Scale Public Dataset with 15M Im,,"Developing large-scale datasets has been critical in computer vision and natural language processing. These datasets, rich in visual and textual information, are fundamental to developing algorithms capable of understanding and interpreting images. They serve as the backbone for enhancing machine learning models, particularly those tasked with deciphering the complex interplay between visual elements in images and their corresponding textual descriptions. A significant challenge in this field is the need for large-scale, accurately annotated datasets. These are essential for training models but are often not publicly accessible, limiting the scope of research and development. The ImageNet and OpenImages datasets, containing human-annotated",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/01/14/lets-go-shopping-lgs-dataset-a-large-scale-public-dataset-with-15m-image-caption-pairs-from-publicly-available-e-commerce-websites,my_library,"datasets, ecommerce, machine-vision, prodmgmt",2024-01-17T07:19:04.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-14-at-4.05.26-AM.png,,False
