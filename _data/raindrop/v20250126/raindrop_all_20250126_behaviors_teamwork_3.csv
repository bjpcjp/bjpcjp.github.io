876785044,An Exercise to Help Your Team Feel More Comfortable with Conflict,,"The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.",https://hbr.org/2019/03/an-exercise-to-help-your-team-feel-more-comfortable-with-conflict,my_library,"behaviors, leadership, prodmgmt, teamwork",2022-06-25T13:31:57.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/03/Mar19_14_667758797.jpg,,False
876770809,The Surprising Power of Simply Asking Coworkers How They’re Doing,,"A recent EY survey found that more than 40% of U.S. respondents reported feeling physically and emotionally isolated in the workplace. This group spanned generations, genders and ethnicities. People want more connection with those they work with. So how can companies connect more effectively with employees and help them feel like they belong within their workplace community? The survey points to one simple solution: establish more opportunities for colleagues to check in with one another. 39% of respondents feel the greatest sense of belonging when their colleagues check in with them, both personally and professionally. By reaching out and acknowledging their employees on a personal level, companies and leaders can significantly enhance the employee experience by making their people feel valued and connected.",https://hbr.org/2019/02/the-surprising-power-of-simply-asking-coworkers-how-theyre-doing,my_library,"behaviors, teamwork",2019-03-03T19:05:51.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/02/Feb19_28_550382887_Plume-Creative.jpg,,False
876769910,Research: Whistleblowers Are a Sign of Healthy Companies,,"An analysis of more than 1.2 million records of internal reports made by employees of public U.S. companies reveals that whistleblowers are crucial to keeping firms healthy. The more employees use internal whistleblowing hotlines, the fewer lawsuits companies face, and the less money firms pay out in settlements. A one standard deviation increase in the use of an internal reporting system is associated with 6.9% fewer pending lawsuits and 20.4% less in aggregate settlement amounts over a three-year period.",https://hbr.org/2018/11/research-whistleblowers-are-a-sign-of-healthy-companies,my_library,"behaviors, teamwork, whistleblowing",2018-11-14T16:19:05.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/11/nov18_14_76692701.jpg,,False
