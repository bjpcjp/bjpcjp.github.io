876778996,Untether AI: At Memory Computation A Transformative Compute Architecture for Inference Acceleration,,"Presented by Robert Beachler, VP of Product, Untether AI.

Traditional processor architectures are failing to keep up with the exploding compute demands of AI workloads. They are limited by the power-hungry weight-fetch of von Neumann architectures and limitations of transistor and frequency scaling. At-memory computation places compute elements directly in the memory array, providing reduced power consumption and increased throughput due to the massive parallelism and bandwidth provided by the architecture. This presentation introduces a new class of non-von Neumann compute designed to meet these AI demands.

The Linley Fall Processor Conference featured technical presentations addressing processors and IP cores for AI applications, embedded, data center, automotive, and communications. Session topic included AI in Edge Devices, Vector-Processing Cores, Advancing Cloud AI, The New Infrastructure Edge, Heterogenous Computing, SoC Design, In-Memory Compute, and Security.
