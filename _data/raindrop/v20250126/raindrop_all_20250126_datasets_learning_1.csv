876780016,MedMNIST v2 Dataset | Papers With Code,,"MedMNIST v2 is a large-scale MNIST-like collection of standardized biomedical images, including 12 datasets for 2D and 6 datasets for 3D. All images are pre-processed into 28 x 28 (2D) or 28 x 28 x 28 (3D) with the corresponding classification labels, so that no background knowledge is required for users. Covering primary data modalities in biomedical images, MedMNIST v2 is designed to perform classification on lightweight 2D and 3D images with various data scales (from 100 to 100,000) and diverse tasks (binary/multi-class, ordinal regression and multi-label). The resulting dataset, consisting of 708,069 2D images and 10,214 3D images in total, could support numerous research / educational purposes in biomedical image analysis, computer vision and machine learning.  Description  and image from: MedMNIST v2: A Large-Scale Lightweight Benchmark for 2D and 3D Biomedical Image Classification  Each subset keeps the same license as that of the source dataset.
