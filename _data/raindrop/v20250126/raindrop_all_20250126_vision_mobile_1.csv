876772715,Powerful computer vision algorithms are now small enough to run on your phone,,"Researchers have shrunk state-of-the-art computer vision models to run on low-power devices. Growing pains: Visual recognition is deep learning’s strongest skill. Computer vision algorithms are analyzing medical images, enabling self-driving cars, and powering face recognition. But training models to recognize actions in videos has grown increasingly expensive. This has fueled concerns about the technology’s carbon…",https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614551/ai-computer-vision-algorithms-on-your-phone-mit-ibm,my_library,"deep-learning, mobile, vision",2019-11-24T17:30:00.000Z,"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tinymachinevision-01-01-13.png?resize=1200,600",,False
