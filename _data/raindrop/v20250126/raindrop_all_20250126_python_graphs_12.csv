881001332,Graphiti: A Python Library for Building Temporal Knowledge Graphs Using LLMs,,"The challenge of managing and recalling facts from complex, evolving conversations is a key problem for many AI-driven applications. As information grows and changes over time, maintaining accurate context becomes increasingly difficult. Current systems often struggle to handle the evolving nature of relationships and facts, leading to incomplete or irrelevant results when retrieving information. This can affect the effectiveness of AI agents, especially when dealing with user memories and context in real-time applications. Some existing solutions have attempted to address this problem. One common approach is using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which involves storing extracted facts and using techniques",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/14/graphiti-a-python-library-for-building-temporal-knowledge-graphs-using-llms,my_library,"llms, python, graphs",2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-10.36.15-PM.png,,False

876793074,Meet PyGraft: An Open-Sourced Python-Based AI Tool that Generates Highly Cu,,"An increasingly popular method for representing data in a graph structure is the usage of knowledge graphs (KGs). A KG is a group of triples (s, p, o), where s (subject) and o (object) are two graph nodes, and p is a predicate that describes the type of connection that exists between them. KGs are often supported by a schema (such as an ontology) that outlines the key ideas and relationships in a field of study and the constraints that govern how these ideas and relationships can interact. Many of the activities for which KGs are employed have a small",https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/09/13/meet-pygraft-an-open-sourced-python-based-ai-tool-that-generates-highly-customized-domain-agnostic-schemas-and-knowledge-graphs,my_library,"graphs, python",2023-09-25T23:24:49.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-13-at-2.40.33-AM.png,,False
