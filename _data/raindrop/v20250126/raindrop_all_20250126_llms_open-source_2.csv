876795535,Top Open Source Large Language Models (LLMs) Available For Commercial Use,,"The top open source Large Language Models available for commercial use are as follows. Llama - 2 Meta released Llama 2, a set of pretrained and refined LLMs, along with Llama 2-Chat, a version of Llama 2. These models are scalable up to 70 billion parameters. It was discovered after extensive testing on safety and helpfulness-focused benchmarks that Llama 2-Chat models perform better than current open-source models in most cases. Human evaluations have shown that they align well with several closed-source models.Â  The researchers have even taken a few steps to guarantee the security of these models.
