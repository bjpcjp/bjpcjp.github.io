876796891,Anthropic AI Launches a Prompt Engineering Tool that Generates Production-R,,"Generative AI (GenAI) tools have come a long way. Believe it or not, the first generative AI tools were introduced in the 1960s in a Chatbot. Still, it was only in 2014 that generative adversarial networks (GANs) were introduced, a type of Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that allowed generative AI to finally create authentic images, videos, and audio of real people. In 2024, we can create anything imaginable using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and others.  However, there is a problem.
