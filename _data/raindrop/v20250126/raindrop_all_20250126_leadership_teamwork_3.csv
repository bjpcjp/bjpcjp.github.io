876788826,How to Encourage Your Team to Give You Honest Feedback,,"Far too often, team members expect to be given downward feedback, but unless they’re explicitly invited to offer upward feedback, they won’t know that it’s even an option. As a manager, it’s your job to ask your employees for feedback on your own performance. How else will you know what you should keep doing and what you should be doing differently? Nevertheless, you might find that your direct reports are reluctant to give you the feedback you need to improve, or even sustain, what’s working. This article addresses five common barriers that managers face in getting helpful feedback from direct reports, and how to address them so that you can gain the insights you need.",https://hbr.org/2022/10/how-to-encourage-your-team-to-give-you-honest-feedback,my_library,"leadership, teamwork",2022-10-29T02:11:31.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/10/Oct22_28_1086475.jpg,,False
876785044,An Exercise to Help Your Team Feel More Comfortable with Conflict,,"The ability to get issues on the table and work through them constructively is critical to having a healthy culture. Managers can normalize productive conflict on your team by using an exercise to map out the unique value of each role and the tensions that should exist among them. Draw a circle and divide that circle into enough wedges to represent each role on your team. For each role, ask: What is the unique value of this role on this team? On which stakeholders is this role focused? What is the most common tension this role puts on team discussions? Answer those questions for each member of the team, filling in the wedges with the answers. As you go, emphasize how the different roles are supposed to be in tension with one another. With heightened awareness and a shared language, your team will start to realize that much of what they have been interpreting as interpersonal friction has actually been perfectly healthy role-based tension.",https://hbr.org/2019/03/an-exercise-to-help-your-team-feel-more-comfortable-with-conflict,my_library,"behaviors, leadership, prodmgmt, teamwork",2022-06-25T13:31:57.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/03/Mar19_14_667758797.jpg,,False
