876790829,Call ChatGPT (or really any other API) from R,,"It’s March 2023 and right now ChatGPT, the amazing AI chatbot tool from OpenAI, is all the rage. But when OpenAI released their public web API for ChatGPT on the 1st of March you might have been a bit disappointed. If you’re an R user, that is. Because, when scrolling through the release announcement you find that there is a python package to use this new API, but no R package. I’m here to say: Don’t be disappointed! As long as there is a web API for a service then it’s going to be easy to use this service from R, no specialized package needed. So here’s an example of how to use the new (as of March 2023) ChatGPT API from R. But know that when the next AI API hotness comes out (likely April 2023, or so) then it’s going to be easy to interface with that from R, as well. Calling the ChatGPT web API from R To use the ChatGPT API in any way you first need to sign up and get an API key: The “password” you need to access the web API. It could look something like ""sk-5xWWxmbnJvbWU4-M212Z2g5dzlu-MzhucmI5Yj-l4c2RkdmZ26"". Of course, that’s not my real API key because that’s something you should keep secret! With an API key at hand you now look up the documentation and learn that this is how you would send a request to the API from the terminal: curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \ -H ""Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"" \ -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \ -d '{ ""model"": ""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ""messages"": [{""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is a banana?""}] }' But how do we send a request to the API using R? What we can do is to “replicate” this call using httr: a popular R package to send HTTP requests. Here’s how this request would be made using httr (with the curl lines as comments above the corresponding httr code) library(httr) api_key",https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/03/call-chatgpt-or-really-any-other-api-from-r,my_library,"chatgpt, _r_",2023-03-04T13:53:18.000Z,https://sumsar.net/blog/call-chatgpt-from-r/images/fungal-zombie-green-hist.png,,False
