876793745,10 Noteworthy AI Research Papers of 2023,,"This year has felt distinctly different. I've been working in, on, and with machine learning and AI for over a decade, yet I can't recall a time when these fields were as popular and rapidly evolving as they have been this year. To conclude an eventful 2023 in machine learning and AI research, I'm excited to share 10 noteworthy papers I've read this year. My personal focus has been more on large language models, so you'll find a heavier emphasis on large language model (LLM) papers than computer vision papers this year.",https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/10-ai-research-papers-2023,my_library,"arxiv, llms, machine-learning",2024-01-07T21:34:39.000Z,"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0046298-1059-4538-bcd8-dfcfc863d7c5_1254x810.png",,False
