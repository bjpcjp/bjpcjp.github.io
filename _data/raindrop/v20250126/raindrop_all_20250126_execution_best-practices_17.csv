876785076,"What Process Mining Is, and Why Companies Should Do It",,"There have long been a few fundamental challenges associated with business process management. But a relatively new and innovative technology, process mining, has the capability to revitalize process management in firms where it has lain fallow for years. One problem involves the creation of “current state” processes — a description of how a business process is being performed today. In business process reengineering, organizations are primarily interested in an improved “to be” process, so often they have little interest in exploring “as is,” or how the process is currently performed. The other general problem with process management is the lack of connections between business processes and an organization’s enterprise information systems. Enter process mining. Process mining software can help organizations easily capture information from enterprise transaction systems and provides detailed — and data-driven — information about how key processes are performing. It creates event logs as work is done: an order is received, a product is delivered, a payment is made. The logs make visible how computer-mediated work is really happening, including who did it, how long it takes, and how it departs from the average. Process analytics create key performance indicators for the process, which enables a company to focus on the priority steps to improve.",https://hbr.org/2019/04/what-process-mining-is-and-why-companies-should-do-it,my_library,"best-practices, execution, process-mining",2022-06-25T18:37:27.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/Apr19_23_989729938.jpg,,False
876782830,3 Practices That Set Resilient Teams Apart,,"New research reveals that how we perform work as a team contributes more to resilience than external stressors.

In the four years that I led the team (until Spring 2021), we did not experience a single severe outage (nothing higher than a SEV3). The Delos design is well-documented in two academic papers (in OSDI 2020 and SOSP 2021).
