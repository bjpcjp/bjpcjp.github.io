A genericized phrase originally used within the animation industry and the film industry as a whole. Based on a scene from the 1988 mixed live-action/animated film 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' in which the main live-action character, Eddie Valiant, bumps into a ceiling lamp whilst handcuffed to the main animated character, Roger Rabbit, causing the lamp to continually swing back and forth throughout the remainder of the scene. The term refers to how the animators went on to meticulously hand-draw unique shadows for the animated character for every frame of the scene. The phrase went on to become a company mythos for the Walt Disney Company, then as a guiding principle within the greater film industry, and now sees use generally.",https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bumping+the+lamp,my_library,"behaviors, purpose",2022-06-28T00:59:49.000Z,,,False
