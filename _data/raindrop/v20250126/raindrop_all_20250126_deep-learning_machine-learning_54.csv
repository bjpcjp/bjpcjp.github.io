The condition is that the classes are not known during supervised learning.   Earlier work in zero-shot learning use attributes in a two-step approach to infer unknown classes. In the computer vision context, more recent advances learn mappings from image feature space to semantic space. Other approaches learn non-linear multimodal embeddings. In the modern NLP context, language models can be evaluated on downstream tasks without fine tuning.
