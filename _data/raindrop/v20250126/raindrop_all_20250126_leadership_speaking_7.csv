876792919,Talking About a Difficult Decision — When You Can’t Share All the Details,,"When you have to communicate a difficult organizational decision to employees, it’s hard to know how much information to provide when you can’t be fully transparent yet. Saying nothing can undermine people’s trust in your motives and compassion, whereas saying too much can leave people feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable as they struggle to process the information and implications. Striking the right balance between these two extremes is a tricky exercise for leaders. The author presents five strategies to help you figure out what to say and do when you can’t yet be fully transparent with your employees.",https://hbr.org/2023/08/talking-about-a-difficult-decision-when-you-cant-share-all-the-details,my_library,"influence-persuasion, leadership, speaking",2023-08-12T01:25:50.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2023/08/Aug23_11_1501196010.jpg,,False

876778449,Find the Right Words to Inspire Your Team,,"It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example, consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not “sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.",https://hbr.org/2021/04/find-the-right-words-to-inspire-your-team,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion, leadership, motivation, speaking",2021-04-18T22:50:02.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2021/04/Apr21_13_HBRquotations.jpg,,False
