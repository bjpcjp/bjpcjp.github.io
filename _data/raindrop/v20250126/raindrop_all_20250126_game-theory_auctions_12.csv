876771718,Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction,,"A Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) auction is a type of sealed-bid auction of multiple items. Bidders submit bids that report their valuations for the items, without knowing the bids of the other bidders. The auction system assigns the items in a socially optimal manner: it charges each individual the harm they cause to other bidders. It gives bidders an incentive to bid their true valuations, by ensuring that the optimal strategy for each bidder is to bid their true valuations of the items; it can be undermined by bidder collusion and in particular in some circumstances by a single bidder making multiple bids under different names. It is a generalization of a Vickrey auction for multiple items.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction,my_library,"auctions, game-theory",2019-08-02T15:22:39.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Microcosm_of_London_Plate_006_-_Auction_Room%2C_Christie%27s_%28colour%29.jpg/1200px-Microcosm_of_London_Plate_006_-_Auction_Room%2C_Christie%27s_%28colour%29.jpg,,False
