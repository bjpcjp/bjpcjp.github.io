876783940,When Keyword Poaching Pays Off,,"Competitive poaching refers to the practice of bidding on ads for a competitor’s search terms, in order to poach customers searching for that brand. It’s a common tactic in the world of digital ads — but is it effective? The author shares results from the first-ever empirical study of this practice, which found that poaching can work well for higher-end brands, but may backfire for lower-end or mass market offerings. Specifically, the study found that when an ad poached customers who searched for a high-end brand, users clicked on it more, but when an ad poached a low-end or mass market target, users were less likely to click. Of course, the author notes that clickthrough rate is just one metric, and there may be other ways in which a poaching campaign could be harmful or beneficial. But these findings can help marketers add a bit of science to the art that is digital advertising, helping them to optimize campaigns for their unique products and customers.",https://hbr.org/2022/05/when-keyword-poaching-pays-off,my_library,"analytics, ecommerce, keywords-ppc-seo, marketing, prodmgmt",2022-05-20T19:40:24.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2022/05/May22_13_1055306876.jpg,,False
