938497501,Pi in the Pentium: reverse-engineering the constants in its floating-point unit,"Based on Ken Shirriff's article ""[Pi in the Pentium: reverse-engineering the constants in its floating-point unit](https://www.righto.com/2025/01/pentium-floating-point-ROM.html)"", here is an outline of each section with explanations of the findings:

| Section | Findings |
|---|---|
| **Introduction** | The Pentium processor's floating-point unit (FPU) computes transcendental functions like sine, cosine, logarithms, and exponentials using polynomial approximations, with coefficients stored in an internal ROM.  |
| **Finding Pi in the Constant ROM** | By examining the Pentium's die under a microscope, the author identified the binary representation of π stored in the FPU's constant ROM, demonstrating how the value is encoded in the hardware.  |
| **Implementation of the Constant ROM** | The constant ROM is implemented using MOS transistors, with each transistor representing a bit; the layout is optimized by interleaving multiple constants within each row, and multiplexers are used to select the desired constant.  |
| **How the Pentium Computes Transcendental Functions** | The Pentium computes functions like sine and logarithms by evaluating polynomial approximations using coefficients from the constant ROM, guided by microcode that directs the FPU through the necessary computational steps.  |
| **Conclusion** | The reverse-engineering of the Pentium's FPU reveals the sophisticated use of polynomial approximations and hardware-embedded constants to efficiently compute complex mathematical functions.  |
| **Appendix: Constants in the Pentium's Floating-Point ROM** | A detailed list of the 304 constants stored in the Pentium's FPU ROM is provided, including their binary representations and corresponding mathematical values.  |
