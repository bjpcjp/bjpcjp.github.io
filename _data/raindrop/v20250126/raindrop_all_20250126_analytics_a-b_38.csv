876798004,6 Statistical Methods for A/B Testing in Data Science and Data Analysis,,"A/B testing is a cornerstone of data science, essential for making informed business decisions and optimizing customer revenue. Here, we delve into six widely used statistical methods in A/B testing, explaining their purposes and appropriate contexts. 1. Z-Test (Standard Score Test): When to Use: This method is ideal for large sample sizes (typically over 30) when the population variance is known. Purpose: Compares the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different. Applications: This technique is frequently employed in conversion rate optimization and click-through rate analysis. It helps identify whether changes in website elements or marketing strategies",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/07/31/6-statistical-methods-for-a-b-testing-in-data-science-and-data-analysis,my_library,"a-b, analytics",2024-07-31T15:52:01.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-11.46.29-PM-1024x943.png,,False
