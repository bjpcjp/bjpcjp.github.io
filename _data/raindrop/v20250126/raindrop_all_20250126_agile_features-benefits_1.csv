876793689,Planning poker - Wikipedia,,"Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker,my_library,"agile, feature-engineering, features-benefits, prodmgmt, projmgmt",2023-10-20T01:13:10.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/CrispPlanningPokerDeck.jpg,,False
