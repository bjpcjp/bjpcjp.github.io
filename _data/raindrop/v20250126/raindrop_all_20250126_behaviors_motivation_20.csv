876787351,Managing the “Invisibles”,,"Reprint: R1405G Even in an age of relentless self-promotion, some extremely capable professionals prefer to avoid the spotlight. “Invisibles” work in fields ranging from engineering to interpreting to perfumery, but they have three things in common: They are ambivalent about recognition, seeing any time spent courting fame as time taken away from the work at hand. They are meticulous. And they savor responsibility, viewing even high pressure as an honor and a source of fascination. Something else unites Invisibles: They represent a management challenge. The usual carrots don’t motivate them; however, managers can take several steps to ensure their satisfaction. Leaders should recognize who their Invisibles are; decide if they want more Invisibles on the team; reward them fairly, soliciting reports on their accomplishments; make the work more intrinisically interesting; and talk to the Invisibles about what works best for them. These actions are well worth taking, as Invisibles not only bring exceptional levels of achievement to an organization but quietly improve the work of those around them, elevating performance and tone across the board.",https://hbr.org/2014/05/managing-the-invisibles,my_library,"behaviors, motivation",2022-07-18T16:04:30.000Z,,,False

876778449,Find the Right Words to Inspire Your Team,,"It’s important to understand that when you, as a leader, communicate with your team, using weaker words weakens your message and blunts your ability to inspire people. It’s not enough to just throw thoughts out there and hope for the best. You need to actively recommend ideas and assert their worthiness in all of your communications. For example, consider these “power words”: “I’m proposing (not “sharing”) an idea that will make our process more efficient.” “I’m suggesting (not “sharing”) a new logo that better conveys our brand message.” “I’m recommending (not “sharing”) a campaign to make our workplace more diverse.” Ultimately, audiences respond more actively to big points than to small words, but thoughtful leaders need to assess both, knowing that the more powerfully they come across — even in small ways — the greater impact they have on the people they hope to inspire.",https://hbr.org/2021/04/find-the-right-words-to-inspire-your-team,my_library,"behaviors, influence-persuasion, leadership, motivation, speaking",2021-04-18T22:50:02.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2021/04/Apr21_13_HBRquotations.jpg,,False
