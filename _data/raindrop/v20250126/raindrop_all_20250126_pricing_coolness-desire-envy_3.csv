A product may be a Veblen good because it is a positional good, something few others can own.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good,my_library,"behaviors, coolness-desire-envy, luxury, pricing",2019-08-20T20:42:48.000Z,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/SC06_2006_Rolls-Royce_Phantom.jpg,,False
