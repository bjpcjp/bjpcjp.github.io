876795641,"Deep Learning Architectures From CNN, RNN, GAN, and Transformers To Encoder",,"Deep learning architectures have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, offering innovative solutions for complex problems across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and generative models. This article explores some of the most influential deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Encoder-Decoder architectures, highlighting their unique features, applications, and how they compare against each other. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are specialized deep neural networks for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. A CNN automatically detects the important features without any human supervision.",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/12/deep-learning-architectures-from-cnn-rnn-gan-and-transformers-to-encoder-decoder-architectures,my_library,"attention, convolutions, deep-learning, gans, llms, rnns",2024-04-15T23:39:35.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hn6UWRfcQGS1sXgZTUWw6A.png,,False

We have reached a stage where it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between actual human faces and faces that are generated by Artificial Intelligence. In this post, I will help the reader to understand how they can create and build such applications on their own. I will try to keep this post as intuitive as possible for starters while not dumbing it down too much.

Recent studies by Google Brain have shown that any machine learning classifier can be tricked to give incorrect predictions, and with a little bit of skill, you can get them to give pretty much any result you want.  This fact steadily becomes worrisome as more and more systems are powered by artificial intelligence — and many of them are crucial for our safe and comfortable life.
