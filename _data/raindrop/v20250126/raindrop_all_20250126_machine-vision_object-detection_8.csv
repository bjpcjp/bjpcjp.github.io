876789861,Multi-camera real-time object detection with WebRTC and YOLO,,"Learn how to build a surveillance system using WebRTC for low-latency and YOLO for object detection. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track objects in real-time video streams. With this knowledge, you can create a surveillance system for security or other applications. However, there are challenges to consider when using cameras for object detection, including data privacy and security concerns, as well as technical limitations such as low image quality and lighting conditions. This article will teach you how to overcome some of these challenges and build a reliable surveillance system.",https://softwarescalability.com/editorial/real-time-object-detection-with-webrtc-and-yolo,my_library,"machine-vision, object-detection",2023-01-05T13:25:46.000Z,https://softwarescalability.com/assets/blog/real-time-object-detection-with-webrtc-and-yolo/cover.jpg,,False
