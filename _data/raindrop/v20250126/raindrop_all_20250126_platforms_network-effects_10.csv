908840327,16 Ways to Measure Network Effects | Andreessen Horowitz,,"Network effects are one of the most important dynamics in software and marketplace businesses. But they’re often spoken of in a binary way: either you have them, or you don’t. In practice, most companies’ network effects are much more complex, falling along a spectrum of different types and strengths. They’re also dynamic and evolve as...",https://a16z.com/16-ways-to-measure-network-effects/,my_library,"network-effects, platforms",2024-11-25T23:39:26.707Z,https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2023/09/corporate-Yoast-Facebook.jpg,,False

876786301,Network Effects Aren’t Enough,,"In many ways, online marketplaces are the perfect business model. Since they facilitate transactions between independent suppliers and customers rather than take possession of and responsibility for the products or services in question, they have inherently low cost structures and fat gross margins. They are highly defensible once established, owing to network effects. Yet online marketplaces remain extremely difficult to build, say Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and venture capitalist Simon Rothman of Greylock Partners. Most entrepreneurs and investors attribute this to the challenge of quickly attracting a critical mass of buyers and suppliers. But it is wrong to assume that once a marketplace has overcome this hurdle, the sailing will be smooth. Several other important pitfalls can threaten marketplaces: growing too fast too early; failing to foster sufficient trust and safety; resorting to sticks, rather than carrots, to deter user disintermediation; and ignoring the risks of regulation. This article draws on company examples such as eBay, Lending Club, and Airbnb to offer practical advice for avoiding those hazards.",https://hbr.org/2016/04/network-effects-arent-enough,my_library,"network-effects, platforms, prodmgmt",2022-07-05T21:42:17.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/03/R1604D_RATHOD-e1457464814406.jpg,,False

Don't look now, but something remarkable is happening.  Instagram had twelve employees when it was purchased for $700 million; all of its actual computing power was outsourced to Amazon Web Services. Mighty ARM has only 2300 employees, but there are more than 35 billion ARM-based chips out there. They do no manufacturing; instead they license their designs to companies like Apple, who in turn contract with companies like TSMC for the actual fabrication. Nest Labs and Ubiquiti are both 200-employee hardware companies worth circa $1 billion...who subcontract their actual manufacturing out to China.",https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/27/economies-of-scale-as-a-service,my_library,"network-effects, platforms, prodmgmt",2022-06-04T23:07:00.000Z,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/foxconn.jpg,,False
