876792941,Meet Chroma: An AI-Native Open-Source Vector Database For LLMs: A Faster Wa,,"Word embedding vector databases have become increasingly popular due to the proliferation of massive language models. Using the power of sophisticated machine learning techniques, data is stored in a vector database. It allows for very fast similarity search, essential for many AI uses such as recommendation systems, picture recognition, and NLP. The essence of complicated data is captured in a vector database by representing each data point as a multidimensional vector. Quickly retrieving related vectors is made possible by modern indexing techniques like k-d trees and hashing. To transform big data analytics, this architecture generates highly scalable, efficient solutions for",https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/08/19/meet-chroma-an-ai-native-open-source-vector-database-for-llms-a-faster-way-to-build-python-or-javascript-llm-apps-with-memory,my_library,"llms, vector-databases",2023-08-20T10:56:25.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-19-at-3.55.16-AM-1024x534.png,,False
