From finding a book on Scribd, a movie on Netflix, toilet paper on Amazon, or anything else on the web through Google (like [how to do your job as a software engineer](https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/)), you've searched vast amounts of unstructured data multiple times today. What's even more amazing, is that you've even though you searched millions (or [billions](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/)) of records, you got a response in milliseconds. In this post, we are going to build a basic full-text search engine that can search across millions of documents and rank them according to their relevance to the query in milliseconds, in less than 150 lines of code!",https://bart.degoe.de/building-a-full-text-search-engine-150-lines-of-code,my_library,"keywords-ppc-seo, python, search",2021-03-28T17:25:22.000Z,,,False
