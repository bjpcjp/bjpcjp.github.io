881001290,Why GPU Utilization Falls Short: Understanding Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) Efficiency for Better L,,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant prominence in recent years, driving the need for efficient GPU utilization in machine learning tasks. However, researchers face a critical challenge in accurately assessing GPU performance. The commonly used metric, GPU Utilization, accessed through nvidia-smi or integrated observability tools, has proven to be an unreliable indicator of actual computational efficiency. Surprisingly, 100% GPU utilization can be achieved merely by reading and writing to memory without performing any computations. This revelation has sparked a reevaluation of performance metrics and methodologies in the field of machine learning, prompting researchers to seek more accurate ways to",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/03/why-gpu-utilization-falls-short-understanding-streaming-multiprocessor-sm-efficiency-for-better-llm-performance,my_library,"llms, gpus",2003-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-03-at-6.18.46-PM.png,,False
