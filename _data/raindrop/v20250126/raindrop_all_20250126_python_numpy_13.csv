876793797,Meet neograd: A Deep Learning Framework Created from Scratch Using Python a,,"Understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) operate is essential in deep learning. However, implementing these networks, especially convolutions and gradient calculations, can be challenging. Many popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch exist, but their complex codebases make it difficult for newcomers to grasp the inner workings. Meet neograd, a newly released deep learning framework developed from scratch using Python and NumPy. This framework aims to simplify the understanding of core concepts in deep learning, such as automatic differentiation, by providing a more intuitive and readable codebase. It addresses the complexity barrier often associated with existing frameworks, making it easier for",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/01/11/meet-neograd-a-deep-learning-framework-created-from-scratch-using-python-and-numpy-with-automatic-differentiation-capabilities,my_library,"deep-learning, numpy, python",2024-01-17T07:10:03.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ng.png,,False
