881001396,PAM4: Pulse Amplitude Modulation Explained,,An in-depth look at the high-speed data communication standard's benefits and tradeoffs.,https://semiengineering.com/pam4-pulse-amplitude-modulation-explained,my_library,"circuits-electronics, networking, dsp",2024-10-19T18:32:36.992Z,https://semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2024-09-24-at-10.51.43%E2%80%AFAM.png?fit=1760%2C1316&ssl=1,"Highlight:PAM4 is a four-level pulse amplitude-modulated signal, which can be electrical or optical.

Highlight:non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding

Highlight:PAM4 uses four levels. A PAM4 signal can appear as one of four voltages during each clock cycle, each voltage level representing two bits

Highlight:Shannon-Hartley theorem

Highlight:The PHY circuit

Highlight:an 800GE network can be carried by eight 100 Gb/s (50 GBaud PAM4) lanes rather than sixteen 50 Gb/s NRZ lanes.

Highlight:PAM4 devices are far more susceptible to noise

Highlight:decision feedback equalization (DFE)

Highlight:forward error correction (FEC).

Highlight:redundant bits use the same channel

Highlight:PCIe® 6.0 adopted PAM4 in 2022

Highlight:USB4 Version 2.0, which uses PAM3 signaling

Highlight:Coherent optics uses quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a method of complex modulation that increases transmission speed and efficiency by extending multi-level modulation to two or more dimensions

Highlight:signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), rise and fall time, 12-edge jitter, and transmitter dispersion and eye closure quaternary (TDECQ)

Highlight:eye height and width

Highlight:“closed eye”

Highlight:requires an oscilloscope with at least 50 GHz bandwidth",False
