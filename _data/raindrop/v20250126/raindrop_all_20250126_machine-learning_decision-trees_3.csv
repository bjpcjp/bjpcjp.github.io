876793024,Machine Learning Using Decision Trees in Ruby,,"In the era of hyper-sophisticated machine learning models like ChatGPT, it is surprising how effective the classic decision tree model remains, especially when used in conjunction with other techniques, such as bagging, boosting and random forests. In this blog post we demonstrate how to build an effective decision tree model, and train this model on some sample data.",https://www.vector-logic.com/blog/posts/machine-learning-using-decision-trees-in-ruby,my_library,"decision-trees, machine-learning, ruby",2023-09-17T22:10:43.000Z,https://vector-logic-uploads.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/c8twh8tz2af2dodgo1n16nm29rbm?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22kat-closon-unsplash.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27kat-closon-unsplash.jpg&response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA42JND3JCHLMFD5NL%2F20241015%2Feu-west-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20241015T182442Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=85ba0eafcc6c2a1c1df42887f4984a784073487b3455b8582bff7910fd1e0efc,,False
