876795641,"Deep Learning Architectures From CNN, RNN, GAN, and Transformers To Encoder",,"Deep learning architectures have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, offering innovative solutions for complex problems across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and generative models. This article explores some of the most influential deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Encoder-Decoder architectures, highlighting their unique features, applications, and how they compare against each other. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are specialized deep neural networks for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images. A CNN automatically detects the important features without any human supervision.",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/04/12/deep-learning-architectures-from-cnn-rnn-gan-and-transformers-to-encoder-decoder-architectures,my_library,"attention, convolutions, deep-learning, gans, llms, rnns",2024-04-15T23:39:35.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Hn6UWRfcQGS1sXgZTUWw6A.png,,False
