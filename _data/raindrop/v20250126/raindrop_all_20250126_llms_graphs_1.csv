881001332,Graphiti: A Python Library for Building Temporal Knowledge Graphs Using LLMs,,"The challenge of managing and recalling facts from complex, evolving conversations is a key problem for many AI-driven applications. As information grows and changes over time, maintaining accurate context becomes increasingly difficult. Current systems often struggle to handle the evolving nature of relationships and facts, leading to incomplete or irrelevant results when retrieving information. This can affect the effectiveness of AI agents, especially when dealing with user memories and context in real-time applications. Some existing solutions have attempted to address this problem. One common approach is using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which involves storing extracted facts and using techniques",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/09/14/graphiti-a-python-library-for-building-temporal-knowledge-graphs-using-llms,my_library,"llms, python, graphs",2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-13-at-10.36.15-PM.png,,False
