876777137,Methodology | Papers With Code,,"**Transfer Learning** is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed and fine-tuned for a related, but different task. The idea behind transfer learning is to leverage the knowledge learned from a pre-trained model to solve a new, but related problem. This can be useful in situations where there is limited data available to train a new model from scratch, or when the new task is similar enough to the original task that the pre-trained model can be adapted to the new problem with only minor modifications.
