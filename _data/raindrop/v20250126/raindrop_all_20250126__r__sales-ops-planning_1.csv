876791697,Using R in Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting,,"Nicolas Nguyen works in the Supply Chain industry, in the area of Demand and Supply Planning, S&OP and Analytics, where he enjoys developing solutions using R and Shiny. Outside his job, he teaches data visualization in R at the Engineering School EIGSI and Business School Excelia in the city of La Rochelle, France. Introduction Demand & Supply Planning requires forecasting techniques to determine the inventory needed to fulfill future orders. With R, we can build end-to-end supply chain monitoring processes to identify potential issues and run scenario testing. In a 3-part series, I will walk through a Demand & Supply Planning workflow: Using R in Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting: an introduction of projected inventory and coverage methodology (this post) Analyzing Projected Inventory Calculations Using R: an analysis of a demo dataset using the planr package Visualizing Projected Calculations with reactable and shiny: once the analysis is done, how would you present your results to your boss? By the end of the series, you will understand how and why to use R for Demand & Supply Planning calculations. Let’s begin! The “problem” we aim to solve When we work in Demand & Supply Planning, it’s pretty common that we need to calculate projected inventories (and related projected coverages). We often have three options to perform this calculation, using: an APS (Advanced Planning System) software an ERP, such as SAP or JDE and of course…Excel! All are fine and have different pros and cons. For example, we simply sometimes don’t have all the data in our ERP either APS, like when we work with third-party distributors or we want to model a supply chain network that relies on different systems with unconnected data. How about using R to perform these calculations? How simple and fast could they be? And, could we do more than just the calculations? For example, could we get an analysis of the projected situation of a portfolio (as an output of a function), so we don’t have to look at each product one by one and can instead: Easily get a summary view of the portfolio? Then zoom on the products with risks of shortages or overstocks? In a series of posts, I will demonstrate how R can help us in Demand & Supply planning. This first post introduces the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions for projected inventory and coverage calculations. proj_inv(): to calculate projected inventories and coverages with some analysis features light_proj_inv(): to calculate projected inventories and coverages (only) Runs faster than the previous function (as it’s lighter and doesn’t provide any analysis features) With R, we have an efficient way to run end-to-end supply chain monitoring processes. Methodology How to calculate projected inventories First, let’s have a look at an example of how to calculate projected inventories. Consider that the field Demand = Sales Forecasts. We start with some Opening Inventory of 1000 units. During month M, we sell 100 units (the Demand). At the end of the 1st period (Month M), the inventory is 900 units. Then, there’s a demand of 800 units at the end of the following period (Month M+1). During the period (Month M+2), we get a Supply of 400 units, and sell 100: it is now 1100 units in stock. That’s all, this is how we calculate projected inventories ☺ Figure 1: Describes the mechanism of the calculation of projected inventories based on Opening Inventories, Demand and Supply How to calculate projected coverages Now, let’s have a look at how to calculate projected coverages. The idea: we look forward. We consider the projected inventories at the end of a period and evaluate the related coverage based on the Upcoming Demand. See the example below: Figure 2: Description of the calculation of projected coverages, considering the inventories at a point in time and the Upcoming Demand If we use Excel, we often see a “shortcut” to estimate the related coverages, like considering an average of the Demand over the next 3 or 6 months. This can lead to incorrect results if the Demand is not constant (if we have some seasonality or a strong trend, for example). However, these calculations become very easy through the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions. Projected inventory calculations in R Now, let’s see how the above is done using two functions from the planr package. First, let’s create a tibble of data for the example shown above (we will cover Min.Stocks.Coverage and Max.Stocks.Coverage more thoroughly in another post): # Install the planr package # remotes::install_github(""nguyennico/planr"") library(planr) library(dplyr) Planr_Example % select(Projected.Inventories.Qty) ## # A tibble: 7 × 2 ## # Groups: DFU [1] ## DFU Projected.Inventories.Qty ## ## 1 Item0001 900 ## 2 Item0001 800 ## 3 Item0001 1100 ## 4 Item0001 300 ## 5 Item0001 200 ## 6 Item0001 -100 ## 7 Item0001 200 We can also take a look at projected coverage. It matches our example calculation in Figure 2: the opening coverage is 2.9 months. Calculated_Inv %>% select(Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods) ## # A tibble: 7 × 2 ## # Groups: DFU [1] ## DFU Calculated.Coverage.in.Periods ## ## 1 Item0001 2.9 ## 2 Item0001 1.9 ## 3 Item0001 2.7 ## 4 Item0001 1.7 ## 5 Item0001 0.7 ## 6 Item0001 0 ## 7 Item0001 99 Very easy to calculate! The proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions can also be used and combined to perform more complex tasks. I’ve described several use cases in the appendix. Moving forward, these functions form the basis for the classic DRP (Distribution Requirement Planning) calculation, where, based on some parameters (usually minimum and maximum levels of stock, a reorder quantity, and a frozen horizon), we calculate a Replenishment Plan. Conclusion Thank you for reading this introduction of projected inventories and coverages in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope that you enjoyed reading how this methodology translate into R. ASCM (formerly APICS) guidelines In the beginning of 2019, the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) published an article about the usage of R (and Python) in Supply Chain Planning, and more precisely for the Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) process, which is related to Demand and Supply Planning. Figure 3: An extract from the ASCM article regarding the S&OP and Digital Supply Chain. It shows how R and Python are becoming more and more used for demand & supply planning and are great tools to run a S&OP process. In the example above, we can see how R helps build the digital environment useful to run the S&OP process, which involves a lot of data processing. The planr package aims to support this process by providing functions that calculate projected inventories. Stay tuned for more on projected calculations using R Thank you for reading the introduction on how to use R for projected inventory calculations in Demand & Supply Planning! I hope you enjoyed this introduction to the planr package. My series of posts will continue with: Analyzing Projected Calculations Using R (using a demo dataset) Visualizing Projected Calculations with reactable and Shiny (or, what your boss wants to see) In the meantime, check out these useful links: planr package GitHub repository: https://github.com/nguyennico/planr URL for a Shiny app showing a demo of the proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions: Demo: app proj_inv() function (shinyapps.io) Appendix: Use cases and examples The proj_inv() and light_proj_inv() functions can easily be used and combined to perform more complex tasks, such as: Modeling of a Supply Chain Network Calculation of projected inventories from Raw Materials to Finished Goods A multi-echelon distribution network: from a National Distribution Center to Regional Wholesalers to Retailers Becoming a useful tool: To build an End-to-End Supply Chain monitoring process To support the S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning) process, allowing us to run some scenarios quickly: Change of Sales plan Change of Supply (Production) plan Change of stock level parameters Change of Transit Time Etc. Here are some detailed use cases for the functions. Third-party distributors We sometimes work with third-party distributors to distribute our products. A common question is: how much stock do our partners hold? If we have access to their opening inventories and Sales IN & OUT Forecasts, we can quickly calculate the projected inventories by applying the proj_inv() or light_proj_inv() functions. Then, we anticipate any risks of shortages or overstocks, and create a collaborative workflow. Figure 4: Illustration of a SiSo (Sales IN Sales OUT) situation. We have some stocks held at a storage location, for example, a third-party distributor, and know what will be sold out of this location (the sales out) and what will be replenished to it (the sales in), as well as the opening inventory. The aim is to calculate the projected inventories and coverages at this location. From raw materials to finished goods In the example below, we produce olive oil (but it could be shampoo, liquor, etc.). We start with a raw material, the olive oil, that we use to fill up different sizes of bottles (35cl, 50cl, etc…), on which we then apply (stick) a label (and back label). There are different labels, depending on the languages (markets where the products are sold). Once we have a labelled bottle, we put it inside an outer box, ready to be shipped and sold. There are different dimensions of outer boxes, where we can put, for examplem 4, 6 or 12 bottles. They are the Finished Goods. We have two groups of products here: Finished Goods Semi-Finished: at different steps, filled bottle (not yet labelled) or labelled bottle We might be interested in looking at the projected inventories at different levels / steps of the manufacturing process: Finished Goods Raw Materials: naked bottles, labels, or liquid (olive oil) Semi-Finished Products For this, we can apply the proj_inv() or light_proj_inv() functions on each level of analysis.
