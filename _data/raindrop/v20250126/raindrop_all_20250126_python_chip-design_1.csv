933339394,CMU Researchers Introduce TNNGen: An AI Framework that Automates Design of Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) from PyTorch Software Models to Post-Layout Netlists,,"Designing neuromorphic sensory processing units (NSPUs) based on Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) is a highly challenging task due to the reliance on manual, labor-intensive hardware development processes. TNNs have been identified as highly promising for real-time edge AI applications, mainly because they are energy-efficient and bio-inspired. However, available methodologies lack automation and are not very accessible. Consequently, the design process becomes complex, time-consuming, and requires specialized knowledge. It is through overcoming these challenges that one can unlock the full potential of TNNs for efficient and scalable processing of sensory signals.Â  The current approaches to TNN development are fragmented workflows, as",https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/12/29/cmu-researchers-introduce-tnngen-an-ai-framework-that-automates-design-of-temporal-neural-networks-tnns-from-pytorch-software-models-to-post-layout-netlists/,my_library,"python, chip-design",2024-12-30T12:26:33.007Z,https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-29-at-10.39.03%E2%80%AFPM.png,,False
