876771787,How to Overcome Your Fear of Failure,,"People are quick to blame themselves for failure. But not doing something because you’re afraid to get started isn’t going to help you grow. Here are four strategies to help you get over the hump. Start by redefining what failure means to you. If you define failure as the discrepancy between what you hope to achieve (such as getting a job offer) and what you might achieve (learning from the experience), you can focus on what you learned, which helps you recalibrate for future challenges. It’s also important to set approach goals instead of avoidance goals: focus on what you want to achieve rather than what you want to avoid. Creating a “fear list” can also help. This is a list of what may not happen as a result of your fear — the cost of inaction. And finally, focus on learning. The chips aren’t always going to fall where you want them to — but if you expect that reality going into an event, you can be prepared to wring the most value out of whatever outcome.",https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-to-overcome-your-fear-of-failure,my_library,"behaviors, failure",2019-08-20T20:53:51.000Z,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/12/Dec18_10_906502772.jpg,,False
