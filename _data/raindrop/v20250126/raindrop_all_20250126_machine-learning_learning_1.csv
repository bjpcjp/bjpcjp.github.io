It’s a big topic, and if you’re new to it, all the technical words might feel confusing. Let’s start with the basics and make it easy to understand. Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, has emerged as a transformative force, empowering machines to learn from data and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming. At its core, machine learning algorithms seek to identify patterns within data, enabling computers to learn and adapt to new information. Think about how a child learns to recognize a cat.

876777132,Computer Vision | Papers With Code,,"**Zero-shot learning (ZSL)** is a model's ability to detect classes never seen during training. The condition is that the classes are not known during supervised learning.   Earlier work in zero-shot learning use attributes in a two-step approach to infer unknown classes. In the computer vision context, more recent advances learn mappings from image feature space to semantic space. Other approaches learn non-linear multimodal embeddings. In the modern NLP context, language models can be evaluated on downstream tasks without fine tuning.   Benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning include [aPY](/dataset/apy), [AwA](/dataset/awa2-1), and [CUB](/dataset/cub-200-2011), among others.

876771744,Jacobian matrix and determinant - Wikipedia,,"In vector calculus, the Jacobian matrix (/dʒəˈkoʊbiən/,&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; /dʒɪ-, jɪ-/) of a vector-valued function of several variables is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives. When this matrix is square, that is, when the function takes the same number of variables as input as the number of vector components of its output, its determinant is referred to as the Jacobian determinant. Both the matrix and (if applicable) the determinant are often referred to simply as the Jacobian in literature.&#91;4&#93; They are named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant,my_library,"algorithms-math, machine-learning",2019-08-06T15:55:48.000Z,,,False

It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote   bush or the pattern of its leaves.     We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society,   seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort.   Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of   ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate   pattern contains it own fixity. In such   perfection, all things move toward death.”   ~ Dune (1965)   I find the concept of embeddings to be one of the most fascinating ideas in machine learning. If you’ve ever used Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Google Translate, or even smartphone keyboard with next-word prediction, then chances are you’ve benefitted from this idea that has become central to Natural Language Processing models. There has been quite a development over the last couple of decades in using embeddings for neural models (Recent developments include contextualized word embeddings leading to cutting-edge models like BERT and GPT2).    Word2vec is a method to efficiently create word embeddings and has been around since 2013. But in addition to its utility as a word-embedding method, some of its concepts have been shown to be effective in creating recommendation engines and making sense of sequential data even in commercial, non-language tasks. Companies like Airbnb, Alibaba, Spotify, and Anghami have all benefitted from carving out this brilliant piece of machinery from the world of NLP and using it in production to empower a new breed of recommendation engines.  In this post, we’ll go over the concept of embedding, and the mechanics of generating embeddings with word2vec. But let’s start with an example to get familiar with using vectors to represent things.
