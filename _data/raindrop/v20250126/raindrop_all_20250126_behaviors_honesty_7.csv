876786640,How to Negotiate with a Liar,,"People, including negotiators, lie every day, so when you’re trying to make a deal, it’s important to defend against deception. The best strategy, says the author, is to focus not on detecting lies but on preventing them. She outlines five tactics that research has shown to be effective: Encourage reciprocity. You can build trust and prompt other parties to disclose strategic information by sharing information yourself. Ask the right questions. Negotiators often lie by omission, keeping mum about relevant facts, but if directly asked, they are more likely to respond honestly. Watch for dodging. Don’t let your counterparts sidestep your questions—write them down in advance, take notes on the answers, and make sure you get the information you’re seeking. Don’t dwell on confidentiality.
