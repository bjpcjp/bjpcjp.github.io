876769662,Cookbook — Bayesian Modelling with PyMC3,,"Recently I’ve started using PyMC3 for Bayesian modelling, and it’s an amazing piece of software! The API only exposes as much of heavy machinery of MCMC as you need — by which I mean, just the pm.sample() method (a.k.a., as Thomas Wiecki puts it, the Magic Inference Button™). This really frees up your mind to think about your data and model, which is really the heart and soul of data science! That being said however, I quickly realized that the water gets very deep very fast: I explored my data set, specified a hierarchical model that made sense to me, hit the Magic Inference Button™, and… uh, what now? I blinked at the angry red warnings the sampler spat out.",https://eigenfoo.xyz/bayesian-modelling-cookbook,my_library,"bayes, machine-learning, python",2018-08-31T20:42:30.000Z,https://www.georgeho.org/assets/images/asterism.png,,False
