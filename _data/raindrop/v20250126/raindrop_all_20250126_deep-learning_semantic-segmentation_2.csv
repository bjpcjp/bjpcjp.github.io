The goal is to produce a dense pixel-wise segmentation map of an image, where each pixel is assigned to a specific class or object. Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics.
