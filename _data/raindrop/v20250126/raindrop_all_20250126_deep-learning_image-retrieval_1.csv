876777133,Computer Vision | Papers With Code,,"**Image Retrieval** is a fundamental and long-standing computer vision task that involves finding images similar to a provided query from a large database. It's often considered as a form of fine-grained, instance-level classification. Not just integral to image recognition alongside [classification](/task/image-classification) and [detection](/task/image-detection), it also holds substantial business value by helping users discover images aligning with their interests or requirements, guided by visual similarity or other parameters.
