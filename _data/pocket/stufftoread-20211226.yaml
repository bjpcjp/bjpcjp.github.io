  intro: My rough estimate is that the unit cost of provisioning a service on AWS is about 3 times that of a competent IT organization providing a similar service in house. Other people have come to the same number, and it hasn't really changed much over the last decade. (If you don't think 3x is right, consider what AWS' gross margin is.)

  intro: I love the look of LaTeX but hate the experience of writing in LaTeX, at least compared to Markdown. Luckily, Pandoc can convert Markdown files to PDFs using a LaTeX engine as the renderer, and includes a custom Markdown specification that can fill almost all my LaTeX needs.

  intro: Why this unimpressive record? There are many factors—economic, ideological, technical—but perhaps the most important has to do with culture and certain societal attributes which inhibit Arabs from producing an effective military force.

  intro: In most cases fq works the same way as jq but instead of reading JSON it reads binary data. The result is a JSON compatible structures where each value has a bit range, symbolic interpretations and know how to be presented in a useful way.

  intro: When price inflation occurs, it can be a very challenging time for everyone. In that type of environment, prices of goods and services often go up faster than wages, and the public and policymakers wish to constrain them. Historically, when price inflation becomes rampant, policymakers tend to put in place price and wage controls to try to tame inflation, but those don’t have a good track record of working out well.
